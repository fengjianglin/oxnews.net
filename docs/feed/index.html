<p>&nbsp;US President Donald Trump paid a surprise visit to Afghanistan on Thursday evening, meeting with his Afghan counterpart Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and spending Thanksgiving with US troops stationed in the country. </p>
<p>It was Trump&#8217;s first trip to the war-torn country since becoming president. </p>
<p>&#8220;In our bilateral meeting, we discussed the important progress we have jointly made in our military efforts in the battlefield, including crushing the Daesh (Islamic State or IS group) in eastern Afghanistan. President Trump appreciated the tireless efforts of the Afghan security forces in this fight,&#8221; Ghani said on Twitter early on Friday. </p>
<p>During the meeting at Bagram Air Base, the main US and coalition military base, some 50 km north of Kabul, both sides underscored that &#8220;if the Taliban are sincere in their commitment to reaching a peace deal, they must accept a ceasefire.&#8221; </p>
<p>After the meeting, the two presidents joined the US troops and delivered speeches and offered their Thanksgiving greetings, Ghani added. </p>
<p>&#8220;We thanked them and their Afghan counterparts for their continued efforts and sacrifices in combating terrorism,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>The war in Afghanistan is the longest war in US history. The death toll of US service members has surpassed 2,400 since the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001. </p>
<p>According to the statistics from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, 2018 was the deadliest year on record for the Afghan conflict, with a total of 10,993 civilian casualties, including 3,804 civilian deaths.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Cuba hopes to generate a quarter of its energy needs from renewable sources over the next decade, an industry official said on Thursday. </p>
<p>The government&#8217;s Renewable Energy Development Program aims to raise clean energy output from today&#8217;s 4 percent to 24 percent by 2030, said Tatiana Amaran, general director of electricity at the Ministry of Energy and Mines. </p>

(Xinhua/Joaquin Hernandez)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The plan focuses on solar power, but other alternative sources have also been prioritized, including bioelectric plants linked to the sugar industry, wind farms and hydraulic power facilities, said Amaran. </p>
<p>Cuban authorities are courting foreign investment in this area by offering incentives and tax breaks. </p>
<p>They also implemented new legal norms, which took effect Thursday, to allow businesses and households to sell any surplus energy they generate from solar panels to the state-run Electrical Union. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cuba now gets 96 percent of its power from fossil fuels, but it has made headway in green energy. Between January and October, it generated 687,000 megawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydropower, solar, cane and non-cane biomass, saving 178,000 tons of fossil fuel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Iraqi Independent High Commission for Human Rights (IHCHR) said on Thursday that a total of 31 demonstrators were killed and more than 1,000 others wounded during the past three days of anti-government protests in capital Baghdad and southern provinces. </p>
<p>A statement by IHCHR said that &#8220;the commission&#8217;s teams have registered, during the period from Nov. 26 to 28, the use of excessive force by the security forces, leaving 25 protesters killed in Dhi Qar province, four in Najaf province and two in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.&#8221; </p>
<p>IHCHR also expressed its deep concern about the high number of casualties among both the demonstrators and the security forces during the three days due to the violence and the use of weapons, as well as the burning of many public and private properties, including the Iranian consulate in Najaf, some 160 km south of Baghdad, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry condemned in a statement the attack by some demonstrators on the Iranian consulate in Najaf on Wednesday night. </p>
<p>The ministry said the purpose behind burning the Iranian consulate is &#8220;to harm the historical relations between Iraq and Iran, as well as with the rest of the world states whose missions are working in Iraq.&#8221; </p>
<p>It reaffirmed its warning that there are some persons who want to derail the demonstrations by distorting the fair demands of the demonstrators. </p>
<p>The Iraqi ministry affirms that &#8220;the diplomatic missions operating in Iraq are highly respected,&#8221; and what happened to the Iranian consulate &#8220;does not represent the Iraq&#8217;s official point of view.&#8221; </p>
<p>Many protesters accuse neighboring Iran of interfering in Iraq&#8217;s internal affairs. </p>
<p>Mass demonstrations have continued in the capital Baghdad and other cities in central and southern Iraq since early October, demanding comprehensive reform, accountability for corruption, improvement of public services and job opportunities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Iraqi security forces cracked down on anti-government protesters in the strife-torn south on Thursday, leaving 22 people dead in a bloody escalation hours ­after the torching of an Iranian consulate.</p>
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, as commander in chief of the armed forces, dispatched military chiefs to several restive provinces to&nbsp;&#8220;restore order,&#8221; the military said in a statement.</p>
<p>Iraq&#8217;s capital and its south have been torn by the worst street unrest since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, as a youth-dominated protest movement has vented their fury at their government and its backers in neighboring Iran.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday protesters burnt down the Iranian consulate in the city of Najaf, yelling &#8220;Victory to Iraq!&#8221; and &#8220;Iran out!&#8221; in an attack condemned by Tehran which voiced its &#8220;disgust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iraq&#8217;s death toll in the street clashes since early October has surpassed 360 with more than 15,000 wounded according to an AFP tally, as authorities are not releasing updated or precise figures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protesters burning tires and throwing rocks and petrol bombs have clashed with security forces unleashing tear gas, rubber coated bullets and live rounds.</p>
<p>Demonstrators across the country have blamed Iran, Iraq&#8217;s powerful eastern neighbor, for propping up the very government they seek to topple.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, streets in Najaf were largely deserted due to the curfew, with public servants told to stay home.</p>
<p>Iran meanwhile demanded Iraq take decisive action against the protesters, with Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi condemning the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iran has officially communicated its disgust to the Iraq Ambassador in Tehran,&#8221; he said in comments carried by Iran&#8217;s state news agency IRNA.</p>

(Xinhua/Zheng Huansong)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The US is to cut its contribution to NATO&#8217;s operating budget, officials said on Thursday, with Germany increasing payments as the alliance tries to appease US President Donald Trump ahead of a summit next week.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly ­criticized European members for freeloading on the US, singling out Germany for lagging behind on an alliance commitment to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense.</p>
<p>While most of Trump&#8217;s anger has been focused on European national defense budgets, there has also been US grumbling about how much Washington contributes to NATO&#8217;s own running costs, and the 29-member alliance has now agreed to a change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the new formula, cost shares attributed to most European allies and Canada will go up, while the US share will come down,&#8221; a NATO official said.</p>
<p>The US currently pays 22.1 percent of the NATO budget &#8211; which totaled $2.5 billion in 2019 &#8211; and Germany 14.8 percent, under a formula based on each country&#8217;s gross national income. Under the new agreement, the US will cut its contribution to 16.35 percent of the total, Germany&#8217;s will rise to the same level and other allies will pay more.</p>
<p>Though the sums involved are small in military terms &#8211; the 29 alliance members spent a total of nearly $1 trillion on defense in 2018 &#8211; not all allies are happy with the move.</p>
<p>Diplomats say France has refused to go along with the new arrangement and will keep its contribution the same at 10.5 percent, arguing that the deal to change the figures was cooked up between Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel without properly consulting other allies.</p>

Photo: IC</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />North Korea fired two &#8220;unidentified projectiles&#8221; on Thursday &#8211; the Thanksgiving holiday in the US &#8211; Seoul said, as nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington remain deadlocked.</p>
<p>The projectiles were fired eastwards from South Hamgyong Province and came down in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, South Korea&#8217;s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.</p>
<p>They added that the launch was carried out at 16:59 pm ­local time (08:59 GMT) &#8211; or the early hours on the east coast of the US, during one of the country&#8217;s biggest annual holidays.</p>
<p>It was also one day short of the two-year anniversary of North Korea&#8217;s first test of its Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say is capable of reaching the entire US mainland.</p>
<p>Pyongyang is banned from firing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday&#8217;s launch was the latest in a series of violations.</p>
<p>&#8220;North Korea&#8217;s repeated launches of ballistic missiles are a serious defiance to not only our country but also the international community,&#8221; he told reporters in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s launch came after Pyongyang fired what it called a &#8220;super-large multiple rocket launcher&#8221; system last month, and the JCS said the latest devices were presumed to be of a similar type. They flew 380 kilometers and reached a maximum altitude of 97 kilometers, the JCS added.</p>
<p>Nuclear negotiations between the US and North Korea have been at a standstill since the Hanoi summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un broke up in February, and Pyongyang has since demanded Washington change its approach by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Last month Pyongyang also claimed to have tested a &#8220;new type&#8221; of submarine-launched ballistic missile &#8211; a potential strategic game changer.</p>
<p>Trump has played down the recent launches, repeatedly pointing to North Korea&#8217;s moratorium on nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches as foreign policy successes for him.</p>
<p>Trump and Kim adopted a vaguely worded statement on the &#8220;complete denuclearization of the<br />

<p>North Korea is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs and lifting some of them was a key demand in Hanoi.</p>
<p>In June Trump and Kim agreed to restart working-level talks during a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone dividing the peninsula and the two sides met in Sweden in October, only for Pyongyang to walk away.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Seoul and Washington said they would postpone planned joint military exercises to ease diplomacy with North Korea, an announcement Pyongyang dismissed.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, another show of US&#8217; nasty long-arm jurisdiction and hegemony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and the US are close to a phase one trade deal with broad consensus having been reached. The trade talks could be a driving factor for the US Congress to promote approval of the act. They see the legislation as a card to further suppress China, intending to make the country bow to their wishes.&nbsp; In this context, both US Congress and the White House are pleased to see the act become a pernicious law against China, although the two sides would still have divergences on details and to what extent they should carry it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be it human rights or democracy, Trump is not interested in Hong Kong. However as both chambers of US Congress have passed the bill by near unanimous margins, by signing on the act, Trump is not likely to peeve any anti-China politician on both sides. Given the uncertainties Trump is facing because of the impeachment inquiry, it is understandable that he will woo, rather than irritate right-wing anti-China Republican senators like Marco Rubio to defend him during the impeachment. Therefore, signing the bill can bring no harm to Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in a statement on Wednesday, Trump said he &#8220;signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China and the people of Hong Kong,&#8221; which suggested that he won&#8217;t let his hands be tied by the Congress in dealing with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the first time a US president has given leeway, as some of Congress&#8217; legislations were somewhat ultra vires. Trump is no exception. He has suggested that he will exercise discretion in deciding whether and to what extent the bills&#8217; provisions are implemented.</p>
<p>This reflected a phenomenon in US domestic political struggle — with the Congress and the White House mutually making compromises and concessions. It cannot be ruled out that the Congress and the president play a double act in the future, which is also a common practice of Washington.&nbsp; The Congress passes an egregious law and then administrative departments play the card in talks and consultations to coerce the other parties to give in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a commonly seen trick of Washington when it is dealing with foreign affairs and China. For instance, during former president Bill Clinton&#8217;s tenure, the US linked so-called human rights affairs with China&#8217;s most-favored-nation-treatment. Going back further, the US enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979 to keep meddling in China&#8217;s internal affairs. For years, Washington has mastered the trick to reap maximum gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is bound to affect China-US relations as the US Congress uses a domestic law to intervene in China&#8217;s internal affairs, sanctioning Hong Kong and even threatening to revoke its special customs status. This will be a setback for Hong Kong as an international financial hub and affect foreign investment in the city, which also hurts US companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The act will have a far-reaching and harmful impact. But how effective the card is for Washington depends on various factors. If the unrest in Hong Kong calms down in a short time, US evaluation of &#8220;the government of Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomous decision-making&#8221; or &#8220;application of sanctions&#8221; will lose its &#8220;legitimacy&#8221; and rationality. If China-US tensions prevail, the Hong Kong card will be repeatedly used. If the China-US relations can go back to normal, the White House will at least think twice before using the card, as it has to weigh the costs and benefits. Otherwise, relations between the two countries may tank and affect the trade consultations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum up, Trump has signed another evil law that intervenes in China&#8217;s domestic affairs and violates the country&#8217;s sovereignty by using Hong Kong as a stick. However, in deciding how to use the stick and whether it will take the US where it wishes, Washington has to think carefully because the move would probably backfire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boris Johnson&#8217;s Conservative Party would win a comfortable majority in Britain&#8217;s parliament if the upcoming election were held this week, according to a poll by respected research firm YouGov.</p>
<p>Britain votes on December 12, with Prime Minister Johnson hoping to secure a majority to be able to push through his<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a> deal to take the country out of the European Union.</p>
<p>YouGov&#8217;s poll, published Wednesday, said if the elections were held on Thursday, the Conservatives would grab 44 seats from the main opposition Labour Party to win a 68-seat majority.</p>
<p>The data showed larger swings from Labour to the Conservatives in areas that are more pro-Brexit, especially in England&#8217;s northern and central regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;As expected, the key thing deciding the extent to which each of these seats is moving against Labour [is] how that seat voted in the European Union referendum&#8221; in 2016, said Chris Curtis, YouGov&#8217;s political research manager.</p>
<p>The poll &#8211; the first in this campaign to predict election results seat-by-seat &#8211; uses a model that correctly forecast 93 percent of seats in the last general election in 2017, according to YouGov.</p>
<p>It said the Conservatives&#8217; total seat count would climb to 359, compared to 211 for Labour &#8211; predicting that the left-wing party would lose 51 seats overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of seats won, this would be the Conservatives&#8217; best performance since 1987,&#8221; said the pollster, who analysed data including interviews with around 100,000 people about their voting intentions.</p>
<p>Johnson, who took over a minority administration in July and has been unable to speed his EU divorce deal through parliament, has pledged to take Britain out of the bloc by January 31.</p>
<p>If the center-right Conservatives are returned to power in the third general election in four years, he is promising to bring back his Brexit deal to parliament before<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>Among the smaller parties in the House of Commons, the poll said the Scottish National Party would gain eight seats to a total of 43, while the Liberal Democrats were predicted a total of 13 seats, Welsh party Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party one.</p>

Some 40 hours after a strong earthquake hit Albania, 48 people have been rescued, as searches for more survivors are racing against time on Wednesday. The earthquake that hit the Balkan country early Tuesday morning has claimed 30 lives so far, according to the country&#8217;s Defense Ministry. (Xinhua/Zhang Liyun)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The death toll from the most powerful earthquake to strike Albania in decades rose to 40 on Thursday, after 10 more ­bodies were pulled from the rubble overnight, the defense ministry said.</p>
<p>The 6.4-magnitude earthquake rattled the Balkan state before dawn on Tuesday, leveling buildings and trapping ­bodies underneath the wreckage in towns near the Adriatic coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten more victims were found during the night, bringing the number of dead to 40,&#8221; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>With the help of experts flown in from across Europe, rescuers have been working tirelessly to clear away the debris of collapsed apartments and hotels in the coastal city of Durres and the town of Thumane, the two areas hardest hit by the quake.</p>
<p>Forty-six people have been pulled out alive so far and have been hospitalized, the defense ministry spokeswoman told AFP.</p>
<p>Hundreds of aftershocks have continued to rattle the country, sparking panic and temporarily halting search efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among some 650 who were injured, at least 10 are seriously wounded, the health ministry said. Thousands have been displaced, either because their homes were severely damaged or because it is still unsafe to return home because of the aftershocks.</p>
<p>The quake, centerd 30 kilometers west of the capital Tirana, was felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia, on the other side of the Adriatic Sea from Albania.</p>
