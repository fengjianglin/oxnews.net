<p>Huawei is likely to upgrade its P40 smartphone by adopting graphene technology to expand its battery capacity to upward of 5,000 mAh, so that it can better accommodate the power-guzzling demand of the 5G network, an industry insider told the Global Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Chinese tech giant is expected to launch its P40, successor of the Huawei P30, in the first quarter of next year, according to media reports. The new device will be equipped with the Kirin 990 5G chipset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As battery capacity is one of the key indexes that determine the performance of a 5G smartphone, some bet Huawei -facing a US trade ban that could potentially cut off its supply of US parts and weigh on its overseas sales &#8211; may introduce graphene technology to increase the competiveness of its new devices and appeal to more 5G users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s P30 series is powered by lithium batteries.</p>
<p>Currently, the maximum battery capacity of most smartphones in the market is about 4,000 mAh. US tech firm Apple&#8217;s iPhone Pro Max has a battery capacity of 3,969 mAh &#8211; the biggest battery Apple has ever used in its smartphones.</p>
<p>&#8220;A graphene battery above 5,000 mAh will give Huawei an edge in the increasingly fierce 5G competition, in particular helping it to outstrip foreign rivals,&#8221; Xiang Ligang, an expert on the telecommunications industry, told the Global Times on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The widely expected graphene battery, coupled with Huawei&#8217;s newly developed 50W rapid-charging technology, could take only 45 minutes to charge fully, industry website gizmochina.com reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has seen brisk sales in the third quarter of 2019. It shipped 41.5 million units in China from July to September, up 66 percent year-on-year, according to a report from Canalys.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Students of Hou Kong Middle School participate in a flag-raising ceremony marking the Chinese Youth Day in south China&#8217;s Macao, May 4, 2018. (Xinhua/Cheong Kam Ka)</p>
<p>Every Monday morning, Macao&#8217;s Hou Kong Middle School holds a national flag-raising ceremony attended by all the teachers and the students.</p>
<p>The ceremony dates back to Oct. 1, 1949, when the school&#8217;s principal Du Nam raised the five-star red flag on the campus. The flag-raising ceremony has been held until today, which has become the common memory of all the teachers and students in Hou Kong Middle School.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the majority of primary and middle schools in Macao hold national flag-raising ceremonies every Monday morning. All schools, colleges and universities in Macao fly the national flags on important festivals.</p>
<p>National flag, national anthem and national emblem as a representative and symbol of the motherland are well known in Macao&#8217;s schools.</p>
<p>Macao has set up a series of laws and regulations to carry out education of national flag, national anthem and national emblem for students in schools.</p>
<p>According to the framework of curriculum for Macao&#8217;s schools by the government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), all of Macao students are required to know the national flag and national emblem, understand their basic meaning and sing the national anthem when at their primary schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Students are raising China&#8217;s national flag and the flag of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) in an activity to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Macao&#8217;s return to the motherland in Macao, south China, Dec. 6, 2019. (Xinhua/Zhang Jinjia)</p>
<p>To implement those regulations, Macao&#8217;s education authorities have worked with institutions from the mainland to publish textbooks for Macao students.</p>
<p>For example, Virtue and Citizen, published by Education and Youth Affairs Bureau of Macao and People&#8217;s Education Press, a famous Chinese publisher, has been used for years in Macao&#8217;s primary and middle schools and accepted gradually by more and more students.</p>
<p>In addition, Macao&#8217;s junior and senior middle schools have set Chinese history as a course in class and use textbooks published by People&#8217;s Education Press.</p>
<p>In recent years, the education sector in Macao has also encouraged the students to read books about China, providing extracurricular reading books for primary and middle schools students, as well as some kindergartens.</p>
<p>Those extracurricular books were jointly published by well-known publishing houses from the mainland and Macao&#8217;s institutions, or provided through exchanges and cooperation with the mainland.</p>
<p>In 2018, China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/4.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Education</a> also gave such books to 77 schools in Macao as presents, 20 sets for each, including the books on Chinese history, the world history, and the Chinese culture such as ancient Chinese poetry and Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s education sector has always attached great importance to the promotion of traditional Chinese culture, and encourage the students to learn about the Chinese history and cultural traditions to have a broad perspective on their own country.</p>

<p>Many schools have extracurricular classes on traditional calligraphy, ancient poetry recitation, Chinese martial arts, Chinese ethnic instruments and other programs.</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s Kao Yip Middle School has set up compulsory calligraphy courses in its primary and middle sectors, which has become one of its characteristics. Students often win prizes in calligraphy competitions at various levels.</p>
<p>He Cheng, the principal of Kao Yip Middle School, said that the school has been providing calligraphy education for a long time, and has carried out a wide range of extracurricular calligraphy activities, to guide students to understand the Chinese cultural tradition, feel the charm of the Chinese language, and promote their interests in and understanding about their country.</p>
<p>In addition, the Macao SAR government and social organizations also support and encourage students to visit the mainland, learn about its social conditions, and experience Chinese history and culture by themselves.</p>
<p>Education and Youth Affairs Bureau of Macao and relevant ministries and institutions of central government have held many summer camps and travel programs for Macao students to know more about their country by paying visits to universities, museums and historical sites in the mainland.</p>
<p>The bureau also plans to increase funding for the &#8220;Know the Motherland Study Tour&#8221; to include teaching staff to study the Chinese history and culture, so that teachers and students together can learn about China&#8217;s modern history and development.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2016, the SAR government launched the One Thousand Talents program which targets middle schools, college and university students and young employees in Macao.</p>
<p>Each year, the program selects 1,000 youth to go to different provinces and cities in the mainland to carry out various learning and exchange activities. The theme of the activity covers fields such as history and culture, sports, scientific and technological innovation, youth entrepreneurship, as well as social work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>About 51.3 percent of China&#8217;s GDP would be digitalization-related by 2023 as the country&#8217;s enterprises step up digitalizing their businesses, global market intelligence firm IDC predicted.</p>
<p>The research firm estimated that by 2025, at least 80 percent of China&#8217;s new corporate applications would use artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
<p>Chief information officers would play bigger roles within companies by planning for innovative development, while there would be rising demand for professionals in ensuring digital security and compliance, IDC said.</p>

<p>China is on fast track for digitalization, while firms should take future-oriented strategies to prepare for related changes, said Kitty Fok, IDC China&#8217;s managing director.</p>
<p>Chinese firms&#8217; spending on digital transformation has expanded over a threshold by accounting for 51 percent of their total information technology (IT) expenditure this year, a previous report by IDC and Chinese IT firm Inspur showed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />China&#8217;s mega water diversion project has transferred nearly 30 billion cubic meters of water in the past five years, official data showed Thursday.</p>
<p>The first phase of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project has directly benefited over 120 million people since it went into operation on Dec. 12, 2014, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/19.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Water Resources</a>.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s per capita water resources is only 28 percent of the world&#8217;s average and China&#8217;s water resources are unevenly distributed across the country. Water is abundant in the south while scarce in the north, making the water diversion project a necessary move.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">China&#8217;s first low-Earth 5G broadband satellite with a high capacity to meet international competition will be launched by Chinese commercial aerospace company Galaxy Space at the end of December, according to a statement sent to the Global Times on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The satellite is the first in China to be built with a capacity of 10 gigabits per second (Gbps), and it will be the world&#8217;s first low-Earth broadband satellite in the Q/V band, an extremely high frequency band, the company said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The satellite has already been developed and ground tests have been carried out with stable results. Once in place, the satellite will be able to cover an area of 300,000 square kilometers, roughly 50 times the size of Shanghai. It is expected to narrow the technological gap between Chinese companies and US companies Oneweb and SpaceX, who have already deployed low-Earth communications satellites. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is increasingly important for Chinese commercial aerospace companies to achieve high spectrum band resources, alongside the rapid development of global commercial communications satellites, Zhang Shijie, an aerospace expert, told the Global Times on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The broad coverage of low-Earth satellites could mean easier access to internet for people in remote areas, as well as more simultaneous data transmission for time-sensitive professions, including live news broadcasting and trading. </span></p>

Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Ge Fengjin, son of Ge Daorong, a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, held a testimony meeting here on Wednesday night to convey the truth about the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 and remind people to never forget history.</p>
<p>At the invitation of a few local civil groups, Ge Fengjin shared his father&#8217;s story at the meeting to mark the 82nd anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre. About 100 people attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Ge Daorong, a survivor of the massacre, was only 10 years old when Nanjing fell to Japanese invaders. He survived by escaping into the Safety Zone during the mass killing, but his three uncles did not.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, he has devoted himself to sharing his story. As he gets older, his son has taken over.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Dec. 13, 1937, the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing and carried out the deadly Nanjing massacre, killing 300,000 of our compatriots, including my family members,&#8221; said Ge Fengjin.</p>
<p>As descendant of a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, he said he should not only remember the painful history, but also has the responsibility to tell the truth and testify to the the mass-killing, adding that he wants more young people to know and remember this part of history.</p>
<p>Sun Zhaiwei, an expert on the Nanjing Massacre and researcher at Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, delivered a speech themed &#8220;The solemn truth of Nanjing Defense Battle&#8221; at the meeting.</p>
<p>He introduced the historical background of the Nanjing Massacre, the historical truth of the Nanjing Defense Battle, from three aspects: &#8220;the capture of Nanjing is the established goal of the Japanese army,&#8221; &#8220;the heroic fight of Chinese soldiers&#8221; and &#8220;the important historical position of the battle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reviewing the truth of the battle is not to continue the hatred, Sun said, but to learn from the historical experience, be vigilant to the resurgence of Japanese militarism which has brought disasters to mankind, and work together to strive for and maintain lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Shota Naito, a postdoctoral fellow majored in history from Japan&#8217;s Meiji University, told Xinhua that he has been attending the testimony meeting of the Nanjing Massacre in Tokyo every year since 2015.</p>
<p>Each year, the organizers invite various people to talk about the massacre in different places and perspectives, which offers a rare opportunity to learn about the truth of history in Japan, he said, adding that he is concerned that some people in Japan do not know the truth of history, and some even attempt to falsify history, forget history and deny the existence of the Nanjing Massacre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time I listen to the stories with tears in my eyes, I feel sorry (for the Chinese people),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Massacre took place after the Japanese troops captured the city on Dec. 13, 1937. Over six weeks, they killed about 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers in one of the most barbaric episodes of World War II.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Americans for Free Trade, a coalition of more than 150 associations united against tariffs, on Wednesday urged U.S. President Donald Trump to reach a &#8220;phase one&#8221; deal with China.</p>
<p>&#8220;We urge you to reach a Phase One deal with China and take the necessary steps to resolve the ongoing trade dispute,&#8221; the coalition wrote in a letter to Trump and strongly encouraged the administration to suspend implementation of the so-called &#8220;Tranche 4B tariffs&#8221; on Chinese goods scheduled for Dec. 15 if a &#8220;phase one&#8221; deal is not finalized before then.</p>
<p>The Trump administration in August announced a plan to put 15 percent tariffs on billions of U.S. dollars in Chinese-made consumer goods on Dec. 15, known as the &#8220;4B&#8221; list of goods.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it is incredibly important for the ongoing negotiations to be allowed to continue without the specter of new tariffs taking effect before a deal is signed,&#8221; the letter said, adding that the U.S. administration has previously delayed those tariffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you noted when the Tranche 4B tariffs were announced, you delayed implementation of those tariffs specifically to avoid harming American consumers over the holidays. This delay should be extended until a deal is reached,&#8221; said the letter.</p>
<p>China is ready to work with the U.S. side to properly address each other&#8217;s core concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect and strive to reach a &#8220;phase one&#8221; deal, which serves the interests of both countries and the rest of the world, China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> spokesperson Gao Feng said last month.</p>
<p>The letter came after anti-tariff campaign group Tariffs Hurt the Heartland said Monday that American consumers and businesses paid an additional 42 billion dollars from February 2018 through October 2019 as a result of Washington-initiated trade disputes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to believe that tariffs are the wrong approach, and we believe these tariffs are causing escalating economic harm to American businesses, workers, farmers and families across the country,&#8221; the coalition said.</p>
<p>Citing a research by Trade Partnership Worldwide, LLC, an international trade and economic consulting firm, the coalition said the U.S. Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods, along with the ongoing Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum and retaliation, have cost the average American family of four nearly 800 dollars this year and have shaved 0.4 percent off the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>If additional tariffs on all of the remaining Chinese imports are applied, &#8220;the negative impacts to American families will grow to over 2,300 dollars, and the hit to U.S. GDP will be a negative 1 percent,&#8221; the coalition warned.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Ocean Park said on Wednesday that its net deficit for the 2018-2019 fiscal year ending June 30 widens to around 557 million Hong Kong dollars (71 million U.S. dollars), more than double of about 237 million (30 million U.S. dollars) in a fiscal year before.</p>
<p>In an annual report of financial results from July last year to June this year, Ocean Park&#8217;s visitor attendances remained stable at 5.7 million, compared with the figure of 5.8 million in 2017-2018 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The Ocean Park saw around 1,734 million Hong Kong dollars (222 million dollars) in revenue, up around 3 percent year-on-year from 1,686 million Hong Kong dollars (216 million dollars) previously, while operating costs increased to over 1,500 million Hong Kong dollars (192 million dollars).</p>

<p>The resort said the net deficit was caused by investments on new entertainment projects, repairs and maintenance expenses on facilities damaged by Typhoon Mangkhut, as well as expenses associated with new infrastructure and facilities.</p>
<p>The park pointed out that it saw a strong local attendance fueled by Hong Kong resident-exclusive promotions and a growth of individual travelers from overseas markets. The growth momentum in local and overseas individual travelers attendances was countered however by the continued decline in tour group tourists attendances which echoed the worldwide trend of personalization in travel, it said.</p>
<p>Chairman of Ocean Park Leo Kung said in the report that the resort was facing fierce competition and increasingly difficult market environment. Despite cost pressures, it&#8217;s mandatory for the park to invest in new infrastructure and entertainment offering to lift guest experience and maintain itself as an entertainment destination and tourism hotspot, he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged after cutting rates at each of the last three meetings, as officials assessed the effect of rate cuts on the US economy.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed&#8217;s policy-making committee, decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent after concluding a two-day policy meeting, in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate,&#8221; the Fed said in a statement, adding that household spending has been rising at a strong pace while business fixed investment and exports remain weak.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate,&#8221; said the statement.</p>

<br />The US economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the third quarter this year, slightly up from the 2-percent growth rate in the second quarter but a sharp deceleration from 3.1 percent in the first quarter, according to the US Commerce Department.</p>
<p>The Fed has lowered interest rates three times since July, amid growing risks and uncertainties stemming from trade tensions, weakness in global growth and muted inflation pressures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our economic outlook remains favorable despite global developments and ongoing risks,&#8221; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;With our decisions through the course of the past year, we believe that monetary policy is well-positioned to serve the American people,&#8221; Powell said, adding the current stance of monetary policy &#8220;likely will remain appropriate&#8221; as long as the US economy stays on track.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The median estimate for the federal funds rate is at 1.6 percent at the end of 2020, suggesting no rate cuts or hikes in 2020, according to Fed officials&#8217; interest rate forecasts released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fed is now quite dovish &amp; given likely alteration of inflation target in 2020 this bodes well for risk assets. Powell just noted how accommodative policy is,&#8221; Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist with RSM US LLP, an audit, tax and consulting firm, tweeted Wednesday afternoon, noting the Fed strongly implied no rate hikes in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The threshold for a rate hike remains much higher than the threshold for a rate cut. Powell underscored that he still saw slack in the economy,&#8221; echoed Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, a major accounting firm, adding she still expects at least one rate cut next year.</p>
<p>However, a majority of the 31 economists recently polled by Bloomberg expect that Fed officials won&#8217;t allow the 2020 presidential election to sway their monetary policy decisions and will keep rates on hold for the next two years.</p>
