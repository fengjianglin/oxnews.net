<p>Following sizzling development and wild growth over recent years, the sharing economy &#8211; a new economic model taking flight in China &#8211; has gradually landed on a sound and rational track.</p>
<p>Chinese ride-hailing giant DiDi recently announced it would re-launch its Hitch carpooling services in several cities in China at the end of this month, more than a year after the company suspended its P2P ride-sharing services due to the murder of a female passenger by her DiDi driver.</p>
<p>The re-launch follows a comprehensive safety review and product revamp that began in 2018. The redesigned service now boasts improved safety features, as well as more rigorous driver/passenger verification and rating mechanisms, the company said.</p>
<p>When the trial was first announced, it was stated that it will begin with trips under 50 kilometers in metro areas between 5 am and 8 pm for female users, and 5 am and 11 pm for male users.</p>
<p>After the 8 pm time restriction for female users aroused a broad discussion of gender discrimination, the company quickly adjusted its terms &#8211; an 8 pm end-of-service will apply to all users.</p>
<p>Industry insiders said that the Hitch services will reflect the nature of a shared economy better than DiDi&#8217;s other businesses like its fast or special ride options, since it places users and drivers at the core of the company&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>DiDi, which was valued at $56 billion earlier this year and claims to have amassed more than 550 million users globally, hasn&#8217;t been able to turn a profit, according to media reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;DiDi&#8217;s final decision to re-launch the Hitch services is due to its transport capacity and business value story,&#8221; an anonymous industry insider said.</p>
<p>The company has continuously readjusted its business and enhanced safety measures since being slammed by Chinese authorities over a passenger&#8217;s murder last August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an internal letter from Cheng Wei, CEO of the Beijing-based start-up, the executive conceded last September that the company&#8217;s expansion model has already created hidden dangers.</p>
<p>Zhu Dajian, director of the Sustainable Development and New-Type Urbanization Think Tank at Tongji University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that if the restarted carpooling services are genuinely provided by middle-class drivers offering rides to others on their way to work or home, instead of those who are professional drivers only looking to earn money via the service, then the services have realized the concept of a shared economy.</p>
<p><strong>Setting a trend</p>
<p></strong>A wild growth model without a sustainable and normalized development path, pursing only an increased market share through high costs, has been clearly reflected in China&#8217;s sharing economy since 2015, when hot money began chasing the new business model enabled by mobile internet.</p>
<p>From shared bicycles to umbrellas and from homestays to industrial production, the shared economy seems capable of permeating almost all aspects of daily life.</p>
<p>&#8220;A shared economy is bound to be the direction of the future since it represents a new trend in the technology reform era, and advantages should not be ignored due to the failure of certain market players,&#8221; said Zhu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese consumers have a generally open mind toward the shared economy meeting their consumption needs, and their eagerness to embrace the new economic model should not be affected,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>One example of such eagerness is the debt-ridden bike-sharing platform Ofo, whose app is still available and whose bikes still can be used. The company&#8217;s tightening cash flow has not been sufficient to operate its normal business, which has directly resulted in a large number of broken bikes lining the streets.</p>
<p>Dai Wei, founder of Beijing-based Ofo, placed restrictions on multiple forms of consumption last year including the rent of high-end office space or travelling for holidays.</p>
<p>The market size of China&#8217;s shared new economy is expected to exceed 9 trillion yuan ($1.28 trillion) in 2020. Currently, it stands at 7.36 trillion yuan, according to a report from market consultancy firm iiMedia Research.</p>
<p>In 2018, more than 760 million people in China participated in the shared economy, of which about 75 million were service providers, the report showed.</p>
<p>Chinese netizens generally had higher satisfaction rates in the use of shared economic products in 2019. The proportion of users who are very satisfied and satisfied is above 50 percent, according to the report.</p>
<p>In the future, with the maturity of the shared-economy model, enterprise services and the application of 5G technology will become a new development direction, the report added.</p>
<p>Some industry insiders have suggested that blockchain technology can help boost the development of the shared economy in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>Investors growing wary</strong></p>
<p>As the new economic model has ushered in its adjustment phase, the capital market is withdrawing its hot money from the once-hyped sector.</p>
<p>Investment in shared-economy industry contracted for the first time in 2019, leading to an explosion of services providing shared rides, communal office spaces and access to a broad range of goods and other services.</p>
<p>Investor impatience led to a 23.2 percent decline in new funding for shared services last year, with total investment at 149 billion yuan, business magazine Caixin reported, citing a report from a research arm of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/3.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Development and Reform Commission</a>, China&#8217;s top economic planner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The venture capital is returning to its original, rational state and has become more discreet over shared-economy projects,&#8221; a senior investor surnamed Jia in the TMT industry told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wary attitude is also related to the overall economic downward pressure,&#8221; he noted, adding that reviewing start-up projects in a rational manner at their conception would be a good idea, instead of injecting hot money blindly to win the race.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data from global accounting firm PwC in the first quarter showed that in the first half of 2019, investment cases in the TMT industry, which has the largest number of unicorns, numbered 3,592, down 30 percent year-on-year, the lowest recorded figure since 2017.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good projects in the shared-economy sector with real social value and business value will ultimately be picked up,&#8221; Jia added.</p>

<p>It is evident that over past years, universities which were financed and set up by enterprises, also known as corporate universities, have been gaining momentum in China.</p>
<p>Meituan Dianping, operator of the country&#8217;s largest food delivery app, announced the official establishment of Meituan University on October 15. The company&#8217;s co-founder Mu Rongjun will head the university.</p>
<p>It will have eight colleges and cover a wide range of sectors centered on Meituan&#8217;s core businesses including catering, delivery and wine, according to a statement the company sent to the Global Times.</p>
<p>On the same day, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, also launched its &#8220;Zhichun Class.&#8221; The class is open to founders of companies from industries related to the internet, Internet of Things, 5G and artificial intelligence (AI), according to a report from domestic news site awtmt.com.</p>
<p>The two are not newcomers. Four years ago, Tencent established Qingteng University, which is the &#8220;only company-level university focused on founders and entrepreneurs that is committed to providing a lifelong learning platform for the creators of cutting-edge industries,&#8221; the company told the Global Times.</p>
<p>In 2015, Alibaba&#8217;s founder Jack Ma Yun and eight of his business and academic associates established Hupan University in Hangzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, and Ma was elected head of the university.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the rapid development of Chinese enterprises, the number of corporate universities in the country is climbing. In 2012, there were just 1,186, but the number is expected to surpass 3,000 in 2019, according to awtmt.com, citing research results from the Qianzhan Industry Research Institute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Corporate universities are not traditional universities, and they are not parallel to the current education system. They intend to train and develop people that can really be used for work and production, and are more practical rather than theoretical,&#8221; Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based independent industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Corporate universities are usually built around firms&#8217; core businesses, which means they can have a say on the industry they&#8217;re involved in and update students with first-hand industry information, Liu said.</p>
<p><strong>Open to &#8216;outsiders&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Li Yi, chief research fellow at the Internet Research Center under the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that corporate universities are not a new concept, as many Western technology giants created similar universities years ago, including Intel and Microsoft.</p>
<p>According to media reports, the first corporate universities were created more than 60 years ago, with General Motors opening the first in the mid-1950s. McDonald&#8217;s Hamburger University debuted in 1961, and Disney University and Motorola University were set up in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Unlike these corporate universities created by Western companies, which serve as places for employees to improve skills and learn their company&#8217;s vision and business goals, Li noted that corporate universities in China developed in a different direction &#8211; they are also open to qualified outsiders who pass their selective tests.</p>
<p>Tencent said in a statement sent to the Global Times that applicants for its university must be a founder, chairman or CEO of an entrepreneurial project that has completed Series-A financing (or equivalent). Additionally, applicants must undergo multiple rounds of screening before they can finally be admitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tencent said that it once had to select 48 successful applicants out of a pool of over 1,000, at an admission rate of only 4 percent. This rate is even lower than some Ivy League universities.</p>
<p>The entry requirements for Hupan University are even stricter. An eligible applicant must be the founder of a company that is at least three years old, has more than 30 employees and an annual revenue of over 30 million yuan ($4.25 million). On top of that, applicants also need to provide proof of their business&#8217; tax payments and provide three recommendation letters, at least one of which must be from the University&#8217;s list of certified referees.</p>
<p>Those who are of an acceptable standard and lucky enough to become an eligible applicant finally progress to the interview stage.</p>
<p>With such strict admission requirements, enterprises can either take this as an opportunity to select potential investment candidates or they could help applicants they have already invested in, help them establish connections and guide their development to gain higher returns, Li said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They could also form powerful [groups] through the students they admitted, who are already experienced and successful entrepreneurs,&#8221; said Li.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 2015, Qingteng University has educated a total of 393 students, including Huang Zheng, founder of Chinese e-commerce firm Pinduoduo, and co-founder of TAL education Liu Yachao; the total valuation of the 393 students&#8217; companies has exceeded 1.7 trillion yuan, according to a document Tencent sent to the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Graduates will also be significant resources for corporations such as Tencent to establish an empire with an easy entrance to all walks of life, analysts said.</p>
<p><strong>Networking crash course</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For many adults who have worked for some time, the key motivation to attend a corporate university is gaining access to the internal resources of big companies and building relations with other industry players who could potentially be helpful to their businesses, Liu said.</p>
<p>Industry observers also said that, for entrepreneurs, corporate universities are a crash course to understand how to run a business. They gain the opportunity to conduct deep communications with important figures such as Alibaba&#8217;s founder Jack Ma Yun.</p>
<p>The price of such an opportunity, however, is not cheap. Hupan University charges a 350,000 yuan attendance fee, and Qingteng University charges 500,000 yuan per student.</p>
<p>Sun Yuchen was one of the first graduates from Hupan Universtiy. Sun is a young Chinese entrepreneur who sparked heated public discussion after casting the winning bid for, and then cancelling, this year&#8217;s lunch with US financier Warren Buffett.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also the founder of blockchain platform Tron, Sun told the Global Times on Tuesday that the training he received at the university was &#8220;extremely beneficial&#8221; in helping him manage, develop and expand his start-up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Each member of the school board, or the &#8216;big names&#8217; of the industry, opens different courses based on their knowledge and expertise, and most of the classes are about sharing the experiences they accumulated as a mature entrepreneur. I learned a lot from them,&#8221; Sun said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the management of a blockchain company is similar to that of a traditional or internet firm, Sun said that he was able to successfully apply the knowledge he learned at the university to the management of Tron. The company now employs 500 personnel, compared with 30 when established.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like a stepping-stone to success. You gain internal resources after studying at the college and then coordinate them well to meet your own development goals,&#8221; Liu said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, being enrolled in the university is itself a recognition of their standing in the market,&#8221; Li said, adding that companies also have a greater chance of receiving investment funds after being selected by top firms &#8211; the companies that run the universities.</p>
<p>One of Qingteng University&#8217;s aforementioned alumni, Huang Zheng from Pinduoduo, was able to secure a large investment from Tencent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shanghai-based company, amid the highly-consolidated Chinese e-commerce market, filed for a massive $1.6 billion IPO on the US stock market on July 16, 2018, marking one of the largest deals of last year.</p>
<p>Another alumnus, Qu Fang, co-founder of the online social commerce site Xiaohongshu, secured an investment worth $100 from Tencent.</p>
<p><strong>When heat fades</strong></p>
<p>Although many consider corporate universities to be a win-win opportunity for both applicants and companies, there is still the argument that too many &#8220;cliques&#8221; led by top firms will not encourage fair competition and innovation in the business world, industry insiders cautioned.</p>
<p>If just being accepted to Hupan University can enable someone&#8217;s project to be endorsed by industry giants, that&#8217;s not fair, Li explained</p>
<p>Li said that it is also difficult to say how long these universities will last in the future. &#8220;It really depends on how graduates and applicants look at the value of the courses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corporate universities as a whole do not share the same development path.</p>
<p>For instance, Meituan University has lower barriers for its applicants, with the ambition of training qualified employees for the industry. This is in stark contrast to some of the university&#8217;s counterparts that are only open to those who come from top management in successful enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the data provided by Meituan, 70 percent of its university&#8217;s trainees will be from small and medium-sized enterprises, who are eager to learn digital skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company told the Global Times on Tuesday that most of its courses are free.</p>

<p>The second China International Import Expo (CIIE), scheduled for early next month in Shanghai, is definitely not an event that many overseas businesses will want to miss. Having attracted over 3,600 participants last year, enthusiasm for the upcoming expo is strong.</p>
<p>The CIIE provides a platform for foreign companies to seek out the potential of the Chinese market while helping them understand the needs of Chinese customers more clearly.</p>
<p>Many foreign businesses, CIIE participants and non-participants, have already expanded their presence in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy, setting up manufacturing bases, regional headquarters, and&nbsp; research and development (R&amp;D) centers.</p>
<p>They are actively tapping into the Chinese market, a major driver of global economic growth, to weather a complicated global economic and trade situation.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla Gigafactory</strong></p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s Gigafactory in Shanghai, which took less than 10 months to build, is ahead of schedule and already producing full vehicles on a trial basis.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is by far the largest market for mid-sized premium sedans. With the Model 3 priced on par with gasoline-powered, mid-sized sedans, we believe China could become the biggest market for the Model 3,&#8221; the US electric car maker said in its earnings report this week.</p>
<p>Tesla purchased a plot of land in Lingang, Shanghai, for its Gigafactory in mid October last year. The factory broke ground in January and is now the largest foreign-invested manufacturing project in Shanghai, with an investment of 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) and a designed annual production capacity of 500,000 units.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in August that he was &#8220;astounded&#8221; by the Gigafactory&#8217;s construction progress, and that its speed was beyond what he had seen before. &#8220;I really think China is the future,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Robust demand for new energy vehicles (NEVs) in the world&#8217;s largest auto market led to Tesla&#8217;s investment in China. Despite sluggish sales in the broader automobile market, China saw NEV sales rise 20.8 percent year-on-year to 872,000 units in the January to September period.</p>
<p>China is Tesla&#8217;s largest market outside the US, with sales jumping 41.8 percent year-on-year to $1.47 billion in the first half of 2019, according to Tesla.</p>
<p>China is transitioning from an export-oriented growth model to a more balanced endogenous growth model, said Cheng Shi, head of research and chief economist at ICBC International Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p><strong>ABB smart factory</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swiss tech giant ABB, which moved the global headquarters of its robotics business to Shanghai in 2006, began construction of a $150 million robotics manufacturing and research facility in Kangqiao, Shanghai, last month.</p>
<p>The new facility, expected to be put into operation in 2021, is designed to be the most advanced, automated and flexible factory in the global robotics industry, utilizing the latest manufacturing processes and becoming a cutting-edge center where robots make robots.</p>
<p>The investment came as ABB raised its bets on China&#8217;s industrial upgrading of its manufacturing sector. As the world&#8217;s largest robotics market, China is quickly becoming a popular destination for foreign investment in intelligent manufacturing. China has rolled out policies to encourage more foreign investment in high-end, intelligent and green manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p>The country is moving from a large manufacturing country to a manufacturing powerhouse, offering a vast market for ABB&#8217;s robotics and automated solutions. China&#8217;s booming artificial intelligence (AI) development could also offer a lift to ABB&#8217;s robotics business.</p>
<p>Sami Atiya, president of ABB Group&#8217;s Robotics and Motion Division, said that the company&#8217;s robotics product line will double in terms of both scope and depth in the next few years.</p>
<p>This means that ABB needs a new factory with a bigger capacity so that it can produce more types of robots to meet ever-changing market and technological trends, Atiya said in an interview.</p>
<p>ABB has invested more than $2.4 billion in China, now its second-largest market, since 1992, and has a total workforce of over 18,000 in the country.</p>
<p><strong>AkzoNobel color factory</strong></p>
<p>AkzoNobel, a Netherlands-based supplier of paints, coatings and specialty chemicals, entered the Chinese market in the early 1980s and has since set up 15 production bases in the country, its biggest single market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know well that if we seek to win the global market, we should first win the Chinese market,&#8221; said Mark Kwok, president of AkzoNobel China/North Asia.</p>
<p>Apart from further investment in production expansion and R&amp;D, AkzoNobel is also penetrating individual neighborhoods by using colored paints to change local environments for Chinese residents, said Kwok.</p>
<p>The company has provided customized, environmentally-friendly solutions for the renovations of old neighborhoods in the Songjiang District of Shanghai. By 2018, it had helped revitalize 2.83 million square meters of Songjiang&#8217;s old neighborhoods with colorful paints, brightening previously grey urban areas.</p>
<p>Through Shanghai, Kwok said that he can see China&#8217;s determination for a wide-ranging opening-up, which can provide good opportunities for the growth of multinational companies in China and globally.</p>

<p>Chinese internet firms have been actively expanding their foothold over recent years in overseas markets, although making inroads in Europe has not been as easy as in some other markets. However, there is huge potential for the prospect of China-EU cooperation in the digital economy and cyberspace governance, industry observers said.</p>
<p>Expanding overseas has been the obvious path for domestic firms after the industry witnessed two decades of rapid growth. Since China achieved a fully functional connection to the internet in 1994, the country has produced several global-level tech firms, including Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT), ranked among the top performers in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By June, the country had 854 million internet users, more than the entire population of Europe, up 25.98 million compared with the end of 2018. The internet penetration rate has reached 61.2 percent according to the China Internet Network Information Center. Meanwhile, 99.1 percent of internet users use smartphones to access the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A report on China&#8217;s mobile internet going global, released by Beijing-based market consultancy iResearch in 2018, showed that some 720 domestic internet firms had expanded overseas by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. Most firms take the initial leap into overseas markets in India or Southeast Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In comparison, the large and mature European markets remain challenging for domestic players.</p>
<p>&#8220;Various languages and cultures as well as relatively complex cyberspace regulation policies in Europe are not favorable to achieve a scale economy, which is a key criteria for internet firms to choose where to explore growth,&#8221; Cheng Maiyue, director of the Wuzhen Institute, an internet industry think tank, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to balance investment and output. Besides, there is rising competition in the European markets,&#8221; Cheng said.</p>
<p>US internet firms including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon already dominate the market in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that Chinese internet firms have no intention to expand their presence in Europe. On the contrary, Europe is usually a key point in Chinese companies&#8217; global expansion,&#8221; said Luigi Gambardella, founder and president of ChinaEU Association for Digital, a business-led International Association aimed at intensifying cooperation in Information and Communications Technology (ICT).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to the complexity of businesses&#8217; globalization, it would be difficult to explain the reasons in one or two sentences. However, I believe Chinese internet companies&#8217; interest in Europe is growing and will continue to grow if their global ambitions swell,&#8221; Gambardella told the Global Times in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Chinese firms have natural advantages in serving Chinese clients, which explains why Chinese mobile payments are almost omnipresent in Europe&#8217;s tourism-related sites to service the increasing number of Chinese tourists, who are inclined to spend more than other travelers, Gambardella noted.</p>
<p>He added that firms would be successful if they had a &#8220;unique selling point and successful marketing&#8221; that could target Europeans. He cited the example of the short-form video app Douyin, known as TikTok overseas, which is owned by Chinese startup ByteDance.</p>
<p>In the latest ranking of non-game apps for the third quarter released by market research firm Sensor Tower, TikTok reached No.2 in terms of downloads. WhatsApp was No.1 but Facebook and Instagram dropped to No.4 and No.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A PR representative from ByteDance said TikTok does not report user numbers when the Global Times asked for information on its user base in Europe.</p>
<p>According to Cheng, TikTok is a potential global internet player with Chinese origins, which has yet to fully demonstrate its value as a marketing tool, as now it mainly focuses on entertainment video content.</p>
<p>&#8220;The era of [Chinese firms] simply replicating Silicon Valley&#8217;s business model is out and only those who can innovate with real competence and serve local demand can survive through the next-phase of competition and thrive. There are still plenty opportunities for domestic players to stand out,&#8221; Cheng noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The era of the internet is full of opportunities. This rule would also apply to Chinese firms which seek to expand in Europe,&#8221; Gambardella said.</p>
<p>The effect of going global by simply replication what worked in China has been waning over recent years, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The internet has become more integrated with industrial upgrades, different from the previous consumer-oriented model, as the former relies more on high technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI), big data, the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G are the next technologies for domestic internet players if they want to gain a global foothold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheetah Mobile, a Chinese mobile internet company that develops mobile applications and provides security software, has been transforming toward an AI-powered industrial internet.</p>
<p>The firm launched a smart service robot called GreetBot last year. The robot has been operating in more than 20 other venues, providing services such as smart guidance, shopping assistance and conference support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The average daily count of voice interactions has reached 2 million, while all interactions total 130 million, Cheetah Mobile said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have applied AI-related business in various scenarios domestically and want to export more products and services to overseas markets, including Europe,&#8221; Vincent Li, director of global marketing at Cheetah Mobile, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The firm has nearly 500 million monthly active users globally with overseas users accounting for 70 percent.</p>
<p>Closer ties</p>
<p>Physical trade between China and EU has been an important component of bilateral trade and economic relations, but now virtual trade, represented by the rising digital economy, is set to herald a prosperous future between the two blocs, experts said.</p>
<p>The EU is China&#8217;s largest trading partner, and China is the bloc&#8217;s second-largest trading partner behind the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the latest data released by China&#8217;s General Administration of Customs, China&#8217;s trade value with EU reached 3.57 trillion yuan ($505 billion) in the first three quarters of 2019, up 8.6 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, the EU&#8217;s overall level in the digital economy area still lags behind. However, looking ahead, the new trends, including key technologies with AI and IoT at their core, will become a crucial part of services trade in bilateral trade between China and EU as it provides important value for both sides,&#8221; Cheng said.</p>
<p>Europe is a key region with its own advantages to conduct digital cooperation, according to Cheng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not as sensitive as the US in terms of technologies. Plus, it may provide two-way value exchange with China compared with other markets like Southeast Asia and Africa, where Chinese firms tend to be the leaders in exporting their technologies and business model,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid the uncertainties clouding global economic growth, digitalization has obviously grown into a major economic driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the China Internet Development Report 2019, the scale of China&#8217;s digital economy reached 31.3 trillion yuan in 2018, accounting for 34.8 percent of the nation&#8217;s total GDP.</p>
<p>Apart from the broad prospects in digital cooperation, the two sides should also learn from each other in cyberspace governance. &#8220;Smart regulation, via new technologies, is quite important for both parties in further enhancing the effectiveness,&#8221; Cheng noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;China and the EU have great potential to work together on cyberspace,&#8221; said Gambardella. For instance, cyber security legislation is an area where policymakers and industry have much to win from dialogue and exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese and EU approaches could further be harmonized. A further suggestion is to explain the rules and learn about solutions to minimize regulatory burden, which otherwise risk stifling new initiatives, according to Gambardella.</p>
<p>Li from Cheetah Mobile said the strict laws and regulation in Europe on cyber security will help Chinese firms to become more in line with international standards in terms of safe system operations and management.</p>
<p>In 2013, China and the EU signed the China-EU 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation, in which the two sides targeted supporting and promoting the establishment of a peaceful, secure, resilient and open cyber space, promoting mutual trust and cooperation through such platforms as the China-EU Cyber Taskforce.</p>

<p>China will never pursue hegemony or seek expansion and the country will remain committed to the basic principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in other countries&#8217; internal affairs, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang delivered a speech on Friday at the General Debate of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, covering a wide range of issues from development to protectionism and unilateralism, global peace and justice and climate change, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the previous 70 years, we Chinese have changed our destiny through tireless efforts,&#8221; Wang said, noting that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, China has traversed tests and challenges and &#8220;has remained true to our original purpose,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>China is guided by the principle of independence, believes in equality among nations, stands for justice and pursues mutually beneficial cooperation, noted the top diplomat.</p>
<p>China will insist on seeking an independent foreign policy of peace, Wang said, adding that peaceful development, which has long been incorporated in China&#8217;s Constitution, is the cornerstone of China&#8217;s foreign policy. &#8220;We will neither submit ourselves to others nor coerce others into submission.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global interaction comes at a time when the world needs to take a more precise and objective view on China thanks to the increased influence of the country, Li Haidong, a professor with the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Saturday.</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s speech served to reveal that China&#8217;s growth will bring opportunities to other countries as it firmly believes in peaceful development and aims to pursue reciprocal cooperation with the world, Li said.</p>
<p>During the past 70 years, China&#8217;s foreign policy has gradually featured an &#8220;increasingly active and constructive role in contribution to the international community,&#8221; Li said, adding that China, at present and in the future, maintains its basic objective to actively participate in handling major issues in regional and global communities.</p>
<p>The world today is not a peaceful place, as unilateralism and protectionism are posing major threats to the international order, Wang said, underscoring China&#8217;s readiness to work with other parties to fulfill its responsibilities as a major country to uphold global peace and justice.</p>
<p>As challenges arising across the world, amid the US-initiated trade war with China, China is expected to insist on its opening-up policy and further promote liberalization of trade and investment, Zhao Jinping, an expert from the Development Research think tank of China, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Protectionism and economic nationalism are not in the common interests of most countries in the world, and such options often bring more fierce disputes and conflicts, experts said, noting that China and the world need to strengthen joint efforts to uphold multilateralism and advance globalization.</p>
<p>China is expected to strengthen cooperation with other countries to advance the reform of the global governance structure, moving it in a better direction, Zhao noted.</p>

<p>Editor&#8217;s Note:</p>
<p></strong>70 years ago, when China was still in the ruins of war and buildings were waiting to be constructed, people did not expect that it would turn into an infrastructure giant so soon that is now even helping others to build bridges, ports and rails overseas.</p>
<p>The country did not stop at that hard-won level of achievement. Building on efforts, sweat and the innovation of millions of Chinese people, now, when new technologies such as 5G and AI are transforming the world and the way people live, the country is on its way to take the lead again in the new era. It seeks to bridge the world, and to promote joint development for the benefit of the world.</p>
<p>It was the development of infrastructure that dragged China forward, and it will also be infrastructure that does this in the future.</p>
<p><center><br />
 <center><br />
  <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-09-25/3cd335e1-1cd5-4ec9-9714-1cd90f19d292.jpg"><br />
 </center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; text-align: left; margin-top: 3px">Graphics: GT</p>
<p></center><br />
<br />During its overall growth in the past 70 years, China&#8217;s achievements in infrastructure are its most obvious and they are recognized by the world. Such achievements can easily be seen through a slew of &#8216;world&#8217;s firsts&#8217; that the country has gained over recent decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Three Gorges Dam, the world&#8217;s biggest hydropower project in terms of electricity production; China&#8217;s South-to-North Water Diversion Project, the biggest water transfer project globally, which benefits 100 million people; the world&#8217;s longest pipelines, the giant West-East Gas Pipeline project with a length of 8,704 km; the world&#8217;s highest railway, The Qinghai-Tibet railway, with its highest point reaching an altitude of 5,072 m; the world&#8217;s longest cross-sea bridge, the 55 km-long Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge; and the world&#8217;s longest underwater tube tunnel at 6.7 km, to name but a few.</p>
<p>Notably, China also has the largest mileage of any high-speed railway in the world. By the end of 2018, the total mileage of the high-speed railway in service was 30,000 km, which accounted for more than two-thirds of the total mileage of high-speed railways in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to media reports, 2.98 billion passenger trips were made during the 40-day Spring Festival travel rush in 2019. Trips taken country-wide within one year could circle the earth seven or eight times if they were placed one after another in a line.</p>
<p>And that mileage is still far from fulfilling domestic demand, particularly during the holidays when people have to scramble for tickets home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China aims to put a further 3,200 km of high-speed rail lines into operation in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Hard-earned achievements</strong></p>
<p>When new China was founded in 1949, it was in chaos after decades of war. Highways, railways…the transportation infrastructure began almost entirely from scratch and developed with an astonishing speed into what can be seen today, Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>From 1949 to 2018, the country&#8217;s transport network saw notable expansion. By the end of 2018, the total railway operation mileage reached 131,000 km, five times higher than in 1949, according to a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).</p>
<p>Inland waterways have expanded 72.7 percent to 127,000 km in mileage, while civil aviation flight routes surged 734 times from the figure in 1950, to 8.38 million km in 2018.</p>
<p>Telecom networks also reported fast expansion. The number of postal service branches increased 9.4 times over the seven decades, reaching 275,000 across the country. China&#8217;s mobile broadband network users topped 1.31 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>Starting from almost zero to the world&#8217;s major infrastructure power today, such achievements do not come from nowhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were built upon the years of efforts and hard work from millions of Chinese citizens who were willing to make selfless contributions.</p>
<p>The CRRC Qingdao Sifang Rolling Stock Research Institute Co (CRRC SRI), which provided key technologies for Beijing&#8217;s first metro train and China&#8217;s first double-deck passenger train, is among the companies that made China into the major infrastructure power that it is today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has played an important technical supporting role in China&#8217;s six large-scale railway speed-up projects, and has independently developed an air-conditioning oxygen supply system, an electrical system and air springs for Qinghai-Tibet trains, to assist Chinese trains to run safely on the &#8220;roof of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the founding of our company 60 years ago, we have always insisted on independent innovation, providing core systems and key products for the rail transit industry. Our many core technologies, such as traction converters, couplers and draft gear, the anti-vibration system, and TCMS, have been applied to China&#8217;s Standard EMU and the &#8216;Fuxing&#8217; EMU,&#8221; the head of CRRC SRI told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, we have applied technology innovation for high-speed trains to the urban rail field, which is the first time China has achieved the integration of the three systems of traction, network and braking, and on this basis has built intelligent trains.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s infrastructure development has not slowed after the achievements that have been made thus far. In the future, with the rolling out of regional jets and domestically manufactured large aircrafts, China will usher in an upsurge in the aviation industry, including the new rail transit which has been developed and is in full swing in China, according to Tian.</p>
<p>&#8220;While China has built a strong infrastructure team, it has also developed its own construction machinery and equipment, which utilizes technology that is in a leading global position. China does not simply use manpower to complete bridge construction projects as we see in videos on the internet, but uses a lot of domestic and large mechanical equipment. And the quality, the technology and the cost performance are competitive around the world,&#8221; Tian said.</p>
<p><strong>Linking the world</strong></p>
<p>With its world-leading infrastructure building capacity, China is now eyeing overseas markets in an effort to link the world with its capabilities in the sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is now the largest country receiving orders for infrastructure projects overseas, ranking first in the world for more than ten years in a row. The value of orders every year exceeds hundreds of billions of US dollars,&#8221; Tian said.</p>
<p>The<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI), proposed by China in 2013, aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe, Africa and beyond. It is a vivid example of how China can connect the world with its infrastructure experience.</p>
<p>After years of unremitting effort, the BRI has seen numerous achievements. With increasing collaboration on ports, railways, highways, electricity, aviation and communications, infrastructure development along the Belt and Road has been effectively upgraded, with better-than-expected results.</p>
<p>Additionally, ports are better connected than other transportation facilities between China and other nations along the Belt and Road. China maintains the top worldwide ranking in maritime connectivity, with shipping routes connecting its ports to over 200 nations and 600 major ports.</p>
<p>As for railway connections, the cumulative number of trips made by China-Europe freight trains exceeded 12,000 in 2018, with annual shipments reaching $16 billion, compared with only 17 trips and less than $600 million in 2011.</p>
<p>Total trade between China and other BRI countries amounted to $6.47 trillion over the 2013-18 period. More than 80 overseas economic and trade cooperation zones were built, and more than 244,000 jobs created for locals.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge to the future</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the intelligent era, Tian again stressed the importance of infrastructure capacity as it also provides an important foundation for China to realize industrialization and urbanization in the future, led by information technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, no matter whether it is China or the US, if anyone wants to reindustrialize, there is no platform to support it without technology in infrastructure,&#8221; Tian said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should also watch construction in the information age, including intelligent manufacturing and smart city construction, which are not the same as in the past. For example, high-speed communication [systems] like 5G, cloud computing, cloud servers, and dispersion of data stored in huge clouds, artificial simulation and artificial intelligence (AI). China has also seen good achievements in these fields of infrastructure,&#8221; Tian said.</p>

<p>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></p>
<p>Developed from being a predominantly agricultural economy to the world&#8217;s factory and beyond, over the past 70 years, China has showed the world how it made an economic miracle through the central government&#8217;s bold and resolute economic reform as well as its people&#8217;s hard work. While that economic success not only brings the country improved living standards and a rising urbanization rate, it also has attracted a surging number of foreign companies to enjoy that dividend and grow together with China.</p>
<p>What has China achieved so far? A slew of data and information revealed by the National Bureau of Statistics could shed some light on that question.</p>
<p><strong>Soaring economic growth</strong></p>
<p>China has ranked first in terms of contribution to global economic growth since 2006, becoming the leading engine of world economic growth, an official report said Thursday.</p>
<p>In the past 70 years, China&#8217;s proportion of major economic and social aggregate indicators in the world has further increased, its international status has been further enhanced, and its global influence has continued to grow, said a report released by the National Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p>The report shows that from 1961 to 1978, China&#8217;s average annual contribution to global economic growth was 1.1 percent, but from 1979 to 2012, the average annual contribution rate was 15.9 percent, ranking second in the world.</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2018, the average annual figure climbed to 28.1 percent, ranking first place globally, the report said.</p>
<p>In 2018, the ratio of China&#8217;s contribution to global economic growth was 27.5 percent, 24.4 percentage points higher than in 1978, the report said.</p>
<p>Over the past 70 years, China&#8217;s economic strength has grown remarkably.</p>
<p>In 1952, China&#8217;s GDP was $30 billion, while in 2018, its GDP reached $13.61 trillion, an increase of 452.6 times.</p>
<p>In 1978, China&#8217;s GDP ranked 11th in the world, while in 2010, it overtook Japan to become the second largest economy in the world, and has remained the second largest economy since then.</p>

</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Increasing jobs and living standard<br /></strong><br />
<br />China&#8217;s economy and society have undergone a sea of changes in the past seven decades, and so have people&#8217;s occupations.</p>
<p>In the early years after the People&#8217;s Republic of China was founded in 1949, the majority of the population worked as farmers. At that time about 180 million people were employed, and only 8.3 percent of them worked in urban areas, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed.</p>
<p>In 2018, the country&#8217;s employed population surged to 780 million, with over 56 percent working in cities.</p>
<p>Given the huge size of the Chinese population and the challenges of transforming from a planned economy to a market economy capable of pursuing high-quality development, China has been largely successful in keeping employment stable over the past 70 years.</p>
<p>On top of that, China has seen constant improvement in its employment structure, with new jobs popping up as a result of an evolving economy.</p>
<p>There was no standard classification for jobs in 1949. A popular saying of &#8220;360 professions&#8221; generalized the various occupations before 1999, when China released an official reference book on occupations.</p>
<p>An updated version of the reference book was rolled out in 2015, with 526 manufacturing jobs such as open-hearth steelmaker becoming obsolete, while some 81 new service-related professions such as courier were included.</p>
<p>The rising urban demand for services has attracted farmers like Chang Baohong to seek job opportunities in cities. The 34-year-old man is now a deliveryman working for the country&#8217;s largest online food delivery-to-ticketing services platform Meituan Dianping, and he can deliver 50 orders per day with the help of smart apps.</p>
<p>In 2018, around 46 percent of the employed people worked in the tertiary industry in China. &#8220;This is an indicator of China&#8217;s transformation to a service-based economy,&#8221; said Lai Youwei, head of Meituan Research Institute.</p>
<p>Unlike Chang, entrepreneurial Liao Zaijie, who calls himself a &#8220;new farmer,&#8221; chose to seek his fortune in the country&#8217;s rural areas.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the country&#8217;s mass innovation and entrepreneurship campaign, Liao decided in 2015 to return to Hubei Province&#8217;s countryside to start his own business by helping local farmers sell agricultural products through e-commerce platforms.</p>
<p>As of June this year, Liao&#8217;s sales volume on Pinduoduo, a social e-commerce giant with a huge consumer base in rural areas and small cities, reached 65 million yuan (about $9.16 million).</p>
<p>By the end of 2018, a total of 7.8 million people like Liao had returned to their rural hometowns to start businesses, promoting the application of new technologies, new varieties and expanding new markets, NBS data showed.</p>
<p>To keep pace with economic and technological development, China added 13 new professions to the occupation dictionary in April, featuring a series of high-tech occupations including artificial intelligence technicians, Internet of Things technicians, cloud computing technicians, electronic sports specialists and unmanned aerial vehicle pilots.</p>
<p>As the Chinese economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new jobs requiring new skills and knowledge have appeared in various industries, attracting a relatively stable number of workers, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/14.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Thriving foreign investment</p>
<p></strong>Since the first foreign-invested company entered China about 40 years ago, China&#8217;s economic development has been closely connected with foreign investors.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding scale</strong></p>
<p>After China started to implement the reform and opening-up policy in the late 1970s, it soon enforced the law on equity joint ventures, laying the legal foundation for attracting foreign investors.</p>
<p>From 1983 to 1991, foreign direct investment (FDI) in China went from $920 million to $4.37 billion.</p>
<p>As China started to work toward building a socialist market economy in 1992, a total of 48,764 foreign-invested enterprises were registered that year, surpassing the total amount for the previous 13 years.</p>
<p>From 1992 to 1997, FDI in China surged from $11 billion to $45.3 billion, growing at an average annual rate of 32.7 percent.</p>
<p>After China entered the WTO in 2001, foreign business giants started to set up wholly foreign-owned enterprises, equity joint ventures and contractual joint ventures in the country.</p>
<p>In 2018, FDI into China reached $138.3 billion, 151 times that of 1983 and representing an average annual rate of 15.4 percent.</p>
<p>By the end of 2018, FDI inflow to China had ranked second in the world for two consecutive years and first among developing countries for 27 consecutive years.</p>
<p>Over 960,000 foreign-invested enterprises had been set up in China by the end of last year, with the accumulated foreign direct investment exceeding $2.1 trillion.</p>
<p>At present, the country has attracted investment from over 200 countries and regions. In 2018, major investments came from Asia, the European Union, North America and free port areas.</p>

</center></p>
<p><strong>Increasingly diverse business</strong></p>
<p>Starting along the southeastern coast of China about 40 years ago, the foreign companies have extended their businesses from labor-intensive industries, especially the manufacturing sector, to industries ranging from services to high technology.</p>
<p>As service industries such as information, finance, wholesale and retail, accommodation and catering sectors attract more investment, the tertiary sector has become the main destination of foreign investment in China.</p>
<p>Last year, 53,696 new foreign firms in the service sector were registered, accounting for 88.7 percent of all newly registered foreign-invested companies.</p>
<p>So far, foreign investment has spread to high-tech sectors including computer, integrated circuit and intelligent manufacturing.</p>
<p>Today, China is home to more than 2,000 regional headquarters and R&amp;D centers of multinational companies, seeing improved quality in utilizing foreign investment as well as optimizing the structure of industries.</p>
<p>Emerging in the southeast regions of China, foreign investment moved inward along the border and the rivers of the country as well as to port cities.</p>
<p>In 2018, investment in the eastern region accounted for 85.5 percent of the total foreign investment, while the central and western regions attracted 17.9 percent and 20.4 percent of the total.</p>
<p><strong>Bright future</strong></p>
<p>China has been making consistent efforts to optimize its business environment and embrace investors worldwide. The country advanced to a global ranking of 46 in terms of ease of doing business last year, up from 78 in 2017, according to a World Bank Group report.</p>
<p>In March 2019, China&#8217;s national legislature passed the foreign investment law, the landmark legislation for foreign investment, which will come into effect on Jan. 1, 2020.</p>
<p>According to the law, China will create a stable, transparent, predictable and fair market environment.</p>
<p>The country will set up six new pilot free trade zones to bring the total number to 18, which serve as pioneers to test new forms of foreign investment management, trade facilitation and transformation of government functions.</p>
<p>The country will also lift the investment quota limit for approved foreign investors to boost financial reform and opening up.</p>
<p>Determined to safeguard free trade and integrate itself into economic globalization, China will continue its win-win cooperation with investors around the world.&nbsp;</p>

</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">The grassland cultivation project Go Green Go Lux has grown a total of 1,500 mu of grassland in Katze county, Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region in 2019. Photo: Courtesy of Lux</p>
<p>Situated on the Tibetan plateau, Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region has long been facing pressure from extreme weather conditions and soil degradation due to overgrazing by livestock. Over the past decade, however, the region has witnessed significant improvement when it comes to both the local ecosystem and people&#8217;s livelihoods thanks to collaborative projects involving local authorities, cooperatives and corporations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reversing soil degradation&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grassland cultivation is one of the major pioneering areas that aim to combat these challenges in Tibet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, projects in this field have helped maintain a balance between development and environmental protection. Progress has been significant, desertification in Tibet has been reduced by 13,600 hectares since 2018, while 35,000 hectares of sandy land has been reclaimed since 2009, according to the Ministry of Forestry and Grasslands in Tibet.</p>
<p>The reason that so much effort has been dedicated to grassland cultivation is because it serves as an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem and plays an essential role in water conservation and forage productivity on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Rohit Jawa, president of Unilever North Asia, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>This year marks the ninth year of Unilever&#8217;s Go Green Go Lux campaign, one of the major corporate charity programs in Tibet that aims to not only combat desertification through cultivating grasslands, but also benefit the economy of local communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very fortunate that we started the Go Green Go Lux program,&#8221; Jawa said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past nine years, what started as a small initiative has become quite large as a total of 2,000 hectares of grasslands have been planted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wu Junxi is just one of the environment experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences that has been working with Unilever on grassland cultivation over the past 10 years. For the past decade, he has spent at least six months of the year coming up with cultivation plans that can both ease the pressure on natural grasslands from grazing, and bring more commercial benefits to local farmers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Konggar county alone, the project has cultivated a 66 hectares of grasslands as of today,&#8221; Wu told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cultivated grass can help the local farmers and herdsmen through the winter and sometimes offer additional income through sales of grass. But more importantly, the project has also improved the local environment by reversing soil erosion. So in the long term, it provides a more sustainable way of living for local farmers and herdsmen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lifted from poverty</p>
<p>Konggar is a great example of how grassland cultivation goes beyond protecting local environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We started as a corporate environmental program, but then we realized that raising cattle was one of the major sources of income for local farmers, so the project began helping alleviate local poverty through various ways,&#8221; Ma Wen, vice president of Beauty &amp; Personal Care Categories for Unilever North Asia, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tibetan economy relies heavily on its agriculture, notably livestock raising. According to a report by the Regiona l Bureau of Statistics in Tibet, in the first half of 2019, the primary industry&#8217;s added value reached 4.36 billion yuan ($616.59 million), a year-on-year increase of 3.7 percent, while the total GDP in Tibet in the first half of 2019 reached 68.2 billion yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agricultural sector has also been a highlight when it comes to creating local jobs, according to a report by the local statistics bureau.</p>
<p>In Karze Township in Tibet&#8217;s Lhunzhub county, a grassland cultivation project has been going on for nine years, bringing tangible benefits to the local community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the poverty alleviation scheme provided by the local cooperative and corporations, a lot of people would be out of a job,&#8221; Pazang Dolkar, the Party secretary of Bailang village in Karze Township, told the Global Times in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our village cooperative there are around 30 disabled people, and they are making a decent living by making small handicrafts.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dolkar pointed out that a total of 158 households in the village have benefited from the increase in grasslands this year.</p>
<p>He added that grass cultivation, which is mostly done through cooperation between local government, corporations and experts like Wu, is bringing in over 100,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan annually to the villagers, a substantial addition to the relatively low local income.</p>
<p>According to Dolkar, programs like this are especially helpful for those residents that were living in extreme poverty in the most remote areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The projects help local farmers plan their grazing and grassland cultivation, and help them raise animals like sheep to provide additional income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cooperative in Bailang currently has more than 300 sheep that produce wool.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were a few households living up in the mountains with very poor transportation and they couldn&#8217;t make a living,&#8221; Dolkar said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years, these households were relocated to Bailang village and started to grow grass and raise cattle. Last year on average each household got around 3,000 yuan from growing grass, in addition to their normal revenue from raising cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Future e-commerce model</p>
<p>For the future, villages in Tibet like Bailang are exploring the potential of developing small local businesses with cooperatives and with the help of government and corporate poverty alleviation schemes alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Wang, apart from providing direct feed for the local herdsmen&#8217;s cattle, the grassland cultivation program also plans to teach local farmers to explore possibilities in selling products from the local grasslands and building logistic centers to offer e-commerce channels for locals.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, as a brand we highly focus on the fragrance of our products, and we are producing fragrance essence from the seeds of locally grown grass, which can be developed into a local product,&#8221; Wang said, adding that logistics centers with e-commerce giants such as JD.com are already under development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the future we hope we can build a new supply chain for local communities and develop a sustainable development model,&#8221; Wang said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the plant operated by the world&#8217;s top auto-glass manufacturer Fuyao Group in Changchun, capital of Northeast China&#8217;s Jilin Province, forklifts are busy transporting windshields into standard containers.</p>
<p>These windshields, designed for the medium- and high-end models of auto brand Audi, will be transported to Heilbronn, Germany, by Changchun-Manzhouli-Europe cargo trains before arriving at Audi&#8217;s assembly plants there.</p>
<p>The return trip will carry auto components from Germany to Volvo&#8217;s Daqing factory in Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province, which neighbors Jilin.</p>
<p>The China-Europe cargo trains have closely linked the old industrial base in northeastern China to manufacturing bases in Europe, and have led to increasing industrial cooperation, which is mutually beneficial and has contributed to the economies of both regions.</p>
<p><strong>Advantaged cooperation</strong></p>
<p>A cargo train loaded with containers carrying windshields, wooden flooring, activated carbon and auto components left Changchun on the night of September 5 to deliver the cargo to Russia, Belarus, Poland and Germany along the Changchun-Manzhouli-Europe route.</p>
<p>As an important project for Jilin&#8217;s aim to join the construction of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, the Changchun-Manzhouli-Europe cargo train line was launched in 2015.</p>
<p>The route begins in Changchun, exits China via Manzhouli, the largest land port on the China-Russia border, which is located in North China&#8217;s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and passes through Russia, Belarus and Poland before arriving at the terminus of Nuremberg, Germany.</p>
<p>It measures about 9,800 kilometers, and a single trip usually takes 14 days, saving more than 20 days when compared with sea transportation, said Wang Yue, chairman of the Changchun International Land Port Development Co (CCILP), which operates the cargo trains on the route.</p>
<p>The inbound trains carry imports of engines, gearboxes and steering shafts from Europe and outbound trains ferry exports of goods like windshields, brake pads and bearings made by Chinese companies.</p>
<p>Since the Changchun-Manzhouli-Europe cargo train service was launched in August 2015, it has transported over 43,000 standard containers with a collective value of over 13.8 billion yuan ($1.94 billion).</p>
<p>Demi Ben, managing director of the CCILP, said that Changchun and some other northeastern Chinese cities are home to a number of top auto manufacturers and auto components enterprises, while Bavaria, where Nuremberg is located, is a major German automotive manufacturing base. The similar structure of the industrial clusters in northeastern China and the European country has paved the way for further cooperation.</p>
<p>The Nuremberg warehouse for the Changchun-Manzhouli-Europe railway has been very busy since it was put into use in June 2018, said Demi Ben, who is in charge of the warehouse.</p>
<p>Auto components such as windshields and bearings from northeastern China are usually deposited in the warehouse for short-term storage and then sent to local business customers via a &#8220;door-to-door&#8221; service.</p>
<p>The Nuremberg warehouse has provided great convenience to small and medium-sized enterprises and has attracted plenty of local businesses in Germany to seek cooperation with Jilin enterprises, said Demi Ben.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Changchun-Manzhouli-Europe cargo train route, Jilin Universal Machinery (Group) Co set up a research and development (R&amp;D) center in Munich, which is adjacent to cities that are home to factories of top automotive manufacturers including Audi, Mercedes Benz and Porsche.</p>
<p>The Jilin Universal European R&amp;D Center has cooperated with these automotive manufacturers on a number of projects, including the production of steering knuckles for Porsche Panamera in its China plants.</p>
<p>Currently, there are seven projects in development, including steering knuckles for Audi and a small auto part for Mercedes Benz, which together will bring a revenue of nearly 2 billion yuan to the company, said Li Jibao, chairman of Jilin Universal Machinery (Group) Co.</p>
<p><strong>More opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Along with the frequent trade and cooperation between northeastern Chinese provinces and Europe via the Changchun-Manzhouli-Europe cargo trains, more and more European enterprises are setting out to explore the market in Northeast China.</p>
<p>Jiri Janku, start-up advisor and investor of Feedyou, an artificial intelligence service company from the Czech Republic, said at the just-concluded 12th China-Northeast Asia Expo in Changchun, &#8220;Compared with China&#8217;s fast-developing big cities, small and medium-sized enterprises like us are more willing to seek business opportunities in Northeast China.&#8221;</p>
<p>On August 19, the Sino-German joint venture FAW-Volkswagen put its new proving ground into use in the north of Changchun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proving ground has five functional areas for durability, airbag effectiveness, high-speed loop, dynamic and performance testing, with 26 special test sections and 15 typical test sections in line with Chinese road conditions.</p>
<p>Qin Huanming, a member of the board of directors at FAW Group, said the completion of the new proving ground will further promote the transformation and upgrading of both FAW and Volkswagen, and will deepen cooperation between the two.</p>
<p>A new industrial park is being planned for Changchun. &#8220;Many German companies have shown their interest in our park,&#8221; said Chen Zhen, an executive of the company which develops the park.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s northeastern region now has two pilot free trade zones (FTZs) &#8211; one in Liaoning and the other in Heilongjiang. The newly established China (Heilongjiang) Pilot FTZ will undertake more market-oriented reforms to revive the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With similar latitudes and industrial foundations, there is plenty of scope for cooperation in high-end equipment manufacturing, and the ice and snow industry, among other fields, between the Chinese industrial base and Europe, according to experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following an onstage dialogue with Alibaba&#8217;s Jack Ma Yun during the annual World Artificial Intelligence Congress (WAIC) held in Shanghai at the end of August, Elon Musk, CEO of US electric vehicle (EV) producer Tesla, repeated his routine in China: eating Chinese food and meeting with high-level Chinese officials to pave the way for further development in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems every time Musk comes to China, he will nail down something substantial for his brand,&#8221; an auto industry observer, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>On August 30, the same day Musk met with Transport Minister Li Xiaopeng and Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology Xin Guobin, Tesla announced it was exempt from purchase tax, which could run high up to 90,000 yuan ($13,791) for a Tesla vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese consumers who buy home-made EVs do not have to pay the purchase tax from the very beginning.</p>
<p>From breaking ground in December last year, it took only eight months for the company to build its Gigafactory in Shanghai, breaking the record for the speed of construction for a normal factory, which usually takes 18 to 24 months.</p>
<p>During the WAIC, Musk expressed his praise for the construction efficiency at the Shanghai factory. Tesla China&#8217;s team had done an excellent job building the factory and he was &#8220;astounded.&#8221; Musk said he had never before seen anything move so fast in his life. &#8220;I really think China is the future,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The unprecedented construction speed is &#8220;very Musk,&#8221; as he is an entrepreneur pursuing high efficiency and result-oriented projects. &#8220;China&#8217;s speed, efficiency and Musk&#8217;s leadership style match very well,&#8221; the industry observer said.</p>
<p>On August 19, Tesla received its first comprehensive acceptance certificate, within three days of making the application, which also broke the record for the shortest time local government had taken to issue a certificate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Green light all the way</strong></p>
<p>It seems like Tesla has been green-lighted continuously, since making its foray into the Chinese market several years ago, in terms of gaining government support.</p>
<p>Tesla is the first solely-owned foreign car company in China, where joint ventures take up the majority of the auto sector.</p>
<p>Tesla has chosen to branch out into China at a time that China is determined to open up its auto market in a comprehensive way, and at a time the country endeavors to push ahead its new-energy vehicle sector to take a leading position in the world, said Mei Songlin, a senior analyst in the auto industry.</p>
<p>China lifted the stake cap in joint ventures in the auto sector last year, allowing foreign firms to take major shareholdings.</p>
<p>For Tesla or Musk, it is an opportunity that is not to be missed, Mei told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;China welcomes such a global EV leader to invest in the market, bringing tax revenue and employment, as well as its cutting-edge technology which has been accumulated in the US for years,&#8221; Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, told the Global Times in an interview on Monday.</p>
<p>Tesla is confident that it will meet the tax revenue target it set for its Shanghai factory, which will be put into operation at the end of this year to produce its Model 3 vehicles.</p>
<p>The US car giant disclosed in a July filing that, &#8220;We believe the tax revenue target and capital expenditure requirement will be attainable even if our actual vehicle production was far lower than the volumes we are forecasting.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla agreed to pay 2.23 billion yuan in taxes each year from the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is Tesla&#8217;s second-largest market after the US, yet it is expected to surpass the latter within five years, said Zhang.</p>
<p>Some observers have held a suspicious view of whether or not the US firm would continue its high-profile moves in the Chinese market after local production is on track.</p>
<p>According to Mei, the Chinese market holds high expectations for Tesla as its cars are imported, luxury products that can represent the most advanced EV technologies in the world including autonomous driving technology. &#8220;But will it maintain its brand image after localization? Will its quality remain at the same level after costs are cut in the Shanghai factory? Tesla needs to weather the market test in coming years,&#8221; said Mei.</p>
<p>But one thing is certain &#8211; when doing business in China, foreign firms will not find the work ethic conflict that Chinese auto-glass maker Fuyao has encountered in the US market, he added.</p>
<p><strong>Going abroad is not easy</strong></p>
<p>Fuyao Glass, China&#8217;s largest auto-glass maker, has ignited wide discussion over its work ethic as reflected in the documentary American Factory.</p>
<p>Fuyao&#8217;s boss Cao Dewang provided more than 2,000 jobs in the US&#8217; rust-belt state of Ohio in 2014, by investing in a factory there which had previously been shut down by US carmaker General Motors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese boss brought the factory back to life and helped solve local unemployment.</p>
<p>After successfully blocking the entry of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) organization into the US factory, it became profitable in 2017.</p>
<p>Despite a cultural gap and work-concept conflict between China and the US, China&#8217;s manufacturing competence backed by diligent, efficient workers and strict management over past decades is reflected in the documentary.</p>
<p>Fuyao Glass, as a supplier for vehicles, was welcomed to invest in the US back in 2014 by local government, but the obstacles that it later encountered were difficult to avoid in the US, said Zhang.</p>
<p>However, in the auto-making sector, it has always been challenging to set foot in developed economies such as the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Shenzhen-based automaker BYD held a ceremony in April this year to mark the completion of the 300th electric bus at its Lancaster manufacturing plant in the US state of California.</p>
<p>Since the delivery of its first US battery electric bus in 2014, BYD has provided buses for customers in 13 US states and four Canadian provinces, according to Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>However, in the passenger vehicle sector, it is still hard for Chinese firms to win shares in America. &#8220;Developed countries are holding the auto-making industry firmly in their own hands since it is a pillar industry for an economy,&#8221; said Zhang.</p>
<p>Automakers like Guangzhou Automobile Group Co, Great Wall Motor and SAIC have all disclosed their intentions to enter the US market, but little action has been taken given the complex environment, such organization forces as the UAW, and the US&#8217; strict laws and rules.</p>
<p>The ongoing China-US trade war has also cast a shadow on such attempts by domestic players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The current situation has dented investment opportunities in the country. Even though a Chinese firm&#8217;s investment can bring many benefits for local economy, it does not want to take the risk at the moment amid the trade war,&#8221; said Mei.</p>
<p>Mei added that Chinese automakers&#8217; branding capabilities are generally weak compared with foreign counterparts, and that they need to catch up quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the US or European markets, the lane of internal combustion cars is already quite crowded. It is hard to struggle for space, yet for the electric vehicle segment, opportunities are out there,&#8221; Mei noted.</p>
