<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The logo of China&#8217;s tech giant Huawei. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>&nbsp;Telefonica Deutschland, a unit of Spain&#8217;s Telefonica, chose China&#8217;s Huawei to build its 5G network in Germany, which experts said is a rational choice based on Germany&#8217;s demand of keeping an edge in the coming 5G era. More companies in the Europe are expected to follow suit instead of caving to the US&#8217; bullying actions,&nbsp;industry analysts&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telefonica disclosing its cooperation with Huawei at such a critical moment indicates the German government has nodded to deploy Huawei 5G networks in the country,&#8221; Xiang Ligang, an expert on the telecommunications industry, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The decision by the company comes amid a heated debate in Germany and also in Europe over whether to include Huawei in the continent&#8217;s critical network infrastructure amid US fear-mongering. Germany has yet to finalize security rules governing equipment suppliers.</p>
<p>For European countries, to choose Huawei or not has become more of a choice between &#8220;the market or caving in to US pressure, which is ridiculous and will tear them apart especially at the critical time of developing the next-generation technology,&#8221; an industry insider surnamed Jiang told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jiang noted that the diverging views in the German market are also a result of German carriers&#8217; interests in the US telecom market, noting that the US is now forcing them to face a tough question of whether to choose Huawei or the US market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;The national dignity of Germany doesn&#8217;t allow the country to blindly follow the US government dictation,&#8221; Xiang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;More carriers are set to follow Telefonica,&#8221; Jiang Junmu, chief writer at telecom industry news website c114.com.cn, told the Global Times on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s other two mobile operators &#8211; market leader Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone &#8211; have yet to publicly confirm whether they will stick with Huawei for 5G.</p>
<p>Although Germany&#8217;s attitude toward Huawei 5G networks is ambiguous, the European country definitely wants to use Huawei, Xiang said, noting that without Huawei, which has an absolute advantage in both quality and price, the cost and time of rolling out of 5G networks in Germany.</p>

<p>December 12 marks the shopping spree of &#8220;Double 12,&#8221; the follow up to last month&#8217;s record-breaking Double 11 festival sequel and one of the most exhilarating shopping welcomed by China&#8217;s e-commerce players.</p>
<p>Akin to the Double 11 festival, over 10 million items are on sale in the upcoming shopping spree. Brands on Tmall, an e-commerce website under Alibaba, are also offering discounts this year, and over one million businesses on Taobao have signed up for the upcoming spree sales, according to a report from Beijing-baed China Times, citing Tian De, director of the fast-moving consumer goods department of Taobao.</p>
<p>Although it is hard to tell how successful this year&#8217;s sales in the shopping spree will be, online shopping has become a rising trend in China. During this year&#8217;s Double 11, over 268 billion yuan ($38 billion) of sales were generated. In comparison, the total sales of Cyber Monday, the most popular online shopping spree in the US reached only $9.4 billion, according to figures from Adobe&#8217;s digital insight report.</p>
<p><strong>New drivers of e-commerce</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind the rising trend is China&#8217;s growing middle classes and young people in counties and townships, who are gaining spending power and becoming the major driving force of China&#8217;s e-commerce industry, Lu Zhenwang, founder of Shanghai Wanqing Commerce Consulting, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Young people in fourth and fifth-tier cities are now used to shopping online for high quality items with lower prices, a wider range of selection and fast shipping services compared with offline retailers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the Double 12 of this year, the presales of JDDJ, an online-to-offline retail platform of China&#8217;s another e-commerce giant JD.com, in tier 3-6 cities grew to 8.7 times last year&#8217;s figure. Among them, the presales in Putian of East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, Zhenjiang of East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, Zhuhai of South China&#8217;s Guangdong and other cities increased by more than 2.5 times compared with last year, the spokesperson of JDDJ told Global Times in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The low-tier markets are proven to satisfy the rising needs of local upgrading consumption, along with the digital transformation and omni-channel strategy (a cross-channel content strategy), of retailers,&#8221; the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increasing channels and e-commerce platforms are providing customers with more reasons to spend, along with the fast-developing shipping business that reduced delivery time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Online sales have become more and more popular in China thanks to China&#8217;s well-developed delivery system, which usually takes less than three days to delivery items,&#8221; Lu said, adding that &#8220;the US retail industry still relies on offline sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent years, companies like JD.com and Pinduoduo have joined in shopping sprees, offering consumers more choices. Promotion methods, meanwhile, have also expanded as more shoppers have turned to videos and online streaming to boost sales, which give consumers a direct and interactive experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rising niche market</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to statistics from Taobao, some of the most popular brands in clothing and skincare have released the prices for the upcoming event. For example, Lancôme has posted discounts of up to 50 percent off some on its most signature products. Armani, Adidas and Nike are also among the brands offering deals as good, if not better, than the Double 11 festival.</p>
<p>However, as a shopping festival only one month later than the Double 11, the spree in December usually receives considerably less anticipation and is not likely to exceed Double 11 in terms of the total sales volume. The December&#8217;s shopping spree still provides a platform for the latest niche products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Double 12 is gaining more importance as an independent shopping festival,&#8221; Lu said, adding that &#8220;the growing purchasing power of Chinese consumers and diversified sales channels and promotion methods are behind this growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike the Tmall, which is famous for the popular brands, the Double 11 for Taobao is for the so-called &#8216;long-tail items&#8217; that are usually targeted toward a more niche customer group and are hard to find on the mainstream market,&#8221; Tian from Taobao said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toys and video games, as well as new brands of apparel are being made ready for the sales in the upcoming event. Nintendo&#8217;s Switch, which is under collaboration with China&#8217;s social media giant Tencent, released on Tuesday at the price of 2099 yuan. As of December 5, a total of 73,283 people have preordered Switchs on the e-commerce platform suning.com, according to eastmoney.com.</p>
<p>Pet products are also expected to see a surge in this year&#8217;s Double 12. According to a report by Taobao, new pet products have become the latest rising trend. Cat beds, for example, have doubled in sales in this year&#8217;s Double 12 presales compared to the same period last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More specified markets are emerging and gaining importance with the spree. Electric heated blankets for dogs, for example, have double presales of the same period last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer demand for the most recent and innovative products is the key to&nbsp; success of e-commerce platforms, and their rising standards have fueled a boom in manufacturing and commerce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The 200-million-strong Chinese middles class whose demand of high-quality goods provided a strong boost to the sales of high-end products,&#8221; Lu said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>An investor identification system for southbound trading under Stock Connect programs between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong is expected to be implemented by the end of 2019, Tim Lui Tim-leung, chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said on Tuesday at a forum in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A draft document related to the system for southbound trading (trading of Hong Kong-listed stocks at mainland stock exchanges) has already been released, according to Lui.</p>
<p>The system is likely to make operations between the SFC and China Securities Regulatory Commission more orderly and offer better investor protection, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The identification mechanism in trading serves as a strong safeguard against fraud, money laundering and insider trading, among other types of financial misconduct,&#8221; Dong said, noting that the system can also closely monitor the cash flows of investors&#8217; accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong and mainland stock exchanges operate under different supervisory regulations,&#8221; Dong said, noting that this discrepancy may lead to misconduct if investors&#8217; identities are not sufficiently disclosed.</p>
<p>The identification system for northbound trading has been in place since September 2018. Under the northbound identification model, brokers are required to report the identity of clients to the mainland stock exchanges, related regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The southbound identification is expected to be conducted in similar fashion, according to an announcement on the SFC website in October.</p>
<p>Stricter supervision is a requirement, given the growing trade between the mainland and Hong Kong, Dong said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its launch, cumulative northbound turnover between the mainland and Hong Kong reached 17.41 trillion yuan ($2.88 trillion) by the end of October, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>

<div align="left">
 China&#8217;s early 5G rollout is fueling a boom in emerging high-tech industries including edge computing, through which data is being rapidly processed closer to devices in real-time, rather than relying on a cloud processor that could be thousands of kilometers away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreseeing the imminent arrival of an explosive market, Chinese vendors and artificial intelligence (AI) start-ups are increasing their investments to launch tailored products and open sources to promote international cooperation. Some believe the US tech blockade on China has inspired the country to work harder on the development of cutting-edge technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ultra-fast 5G network expands the volume of data being transferred. But the current cloud computing model is unable to cope with such a large volume of data, giving rise to edge computing which improves response times and saves bandwidth, said Zou Pengcheng, chief technology officer of Chinese AI start-up Thundersoft Technology Co.</p>
<p>The company launched its edge computing platform TurboX Edge Platform in Beijing over the weekend, working out solutions for smart cities, smart retail, intelligent connected vehicles and robotics.</p>
<p>As China is launching a commercial 5G network ahead of other major economies, Chinese technology firms may excel among foreign competitors in the development of edge computing, Zou told the Global Times on the sidelines of an industry forum on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have an edge when it comes to landing applications, thanks to a massive market. Edge computing has already been adopted in the building of smart cities in China,&#8221; Zou added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AI start-up has launched several open-source projects on its edge-computing smart platform, aiming to facilitate international cooperation to accelerate the industry&#8217;s growth, according to Zou.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since May, the US has blacklisted a number of Chinese tech companies, potentially cutting them off from supplies of US parts. Unlike the protectionism of Washington, industry insiders believes Chinese companies are committed to opening up, and that the US tech crackdown will only encourage Chinese firms to perform better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology cannot be developed by a single nation. The more closed the US is, the more open China will be,&#8221; Zou said.

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Year-on-year drops of China&#8217;s foreign trade halted in November in the latest sign of economic resilience.</p>
<p>Despite external uncertainties and domestic downward economic pressure, trade volume expanded 1.8 percent year on year last month in Chinese yuan terms, the General Administration of Customs said Sunday.</p>
<p>Exports increased 1.3 percent over a year ago in November, while imports gained 2.5 percent, ending year-on-year drops in the previous two months.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s private players, the trade sector&#8217;s mainstay, managed to achieve a 10.4-percent year-on-year growth in trade volume in the first 11 months of this year, by such means as diversifying their trading markets and adjusting trade mix.</p>
<p>Trade with<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> countries rose 9.9 percent from January to November, accounting for nearly 30 percent of the total trade.</p>
<p>Exports of machinery and electronic products grew 4 percent, while automobile exports expanded 5 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;China has achieved better-than-expected trade growth against downward pressure so far,&#8221; said Li Xingqian, director of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a>&#8216;s foreign trade department. Li expected China&#8217;s total trade volume to be around 30 trillion yuan (about 4.26 trillion U.S. dollars) for the whole year.</p>

<p>China has confidence it will maintain steady trade growth with improving quality in 2020 despite sluggish global demand, Li said, citing the country&#8217;s solid trade foundation and vitality of market players.</p>
<p>A recent private survey by financial firm HSBC and research consultancy Kantar showed that Chinese firms are moving fast to brave protectionism pressure.</p>
<p>While foreign companies are prioritizing cost reductions to mitigate the risk of trade tensions, Chinese firms are pursuing a different strategy. Over a third are changing their offerings in key trading markets by entering into joint ventures with local companies or digitizing their sales platforms, the survey showed.</p>
<p>Businesses in China are also prioritizing trade with regional partners, the survey said. Over half of Chinese firms identify the Asia Pacific as a top region for expansion in the next three to five years.</p>
<p>China will take a string of innovative and reform steps to seek high-quality trade growth, aiming to further optimize trade mix, boost efficiency and competitiveness and develop a sound evaluation mechanism by 2022, according to an official guideline.</p>
<p>Among others, the country will lift the trade share with its free trade partners, emerging markets and developing countries in its total trade, further reduce tariffs and institutional costs, boost service trade and promote cross-border e-commerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Foreign-funded banks and insurers have reported a bigger presence in the Chinese market as the country continuously increased efforts on financial opening-up and improving the business environment, said the banking and insurance regulator.</p>
<p>By the end of October, foreign-funded banks had established a total of 41 legal person banks, 114 branches and 976 operating institutions in the Chinese mainland, with their aggregate assets reaching 3.37 trillion yuan (about 478.7 billion U.S. dollars), according to the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>Foreign insurers&#8217; total assets stood at 1.28 trillion yuan as of the end of October.</p>
<p>In the first 10 months, the commission approved 18 set-up applications from overseas banks and insurers.</p>
<p>Welcoming more qualified foreign players to do business in China, the commission said it would further advance the financial opening-up, strengthen regulation and strive to create a fair market climate.</p>

<p>Amid increased uncertainties in the global market and ongoing China-US trade war, British businesses remain confident about their operations in China thanks to the nation&#8217;s continuous efforts to open up and its growing market scale.</p>
<p>More than half of British businesses in China are optimistic about their operations in 2020, and almost two-thirds intend to increase investments, according to an annual business survey released by the British Chamber of Commerce in China (BCCC) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The optimism captured in this year&#8217;s survey shows that China has ramped up efforts to &#8220;address foreign investors&#8217; concerns, including intellectual property rights protection,&#8221; said St. John Moore, chairman of the BCCC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IPR protection fell to No.11 in 2019 from being the second most-pressing regulatory challenge for British businesses in the Chinese market in 2018, according to the survey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a lot of positive work [by the Chinese government] over the past two or three years. Particularly last year, we started to see that come through,&#8221; the chairman told the Global Times on Tuesday, noting that foreign companies are finding a stronger IPR environment.</p>
<p>However, global and domestic economic uncertainties &#8211; such as the China-US trade war and China&#8217;s slowing economy &#8211; are among the leading concerns of British executives, the survey revealed.</p>
<p>China-US trade tensions have not thus far affected British businesses in China, the chairman said. Indeed, there may be a rare opportunity for these businesses in the Chinese market amid US tensions, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen services increase in demand. That may be because just a degree of geopolitical uncertainty has warranted increased activity, which is being attributed to the broader environment&#8230; We see an opportunity there to satisfy the need in that environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the slowdown in economic growth in China, the chairman said, &#8220;We&#8217;re not debating whether or not there is a slowing growth. But what is clear is that there&#8217;s still growth from our point of view.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;British businesses are certainly seeing the opportunity,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet there is more to be done to ensure a fair and level playing field,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One-quarter of businesses believe that foreign-invested enterprises are treated unequally compared with domestic competitors, and nearly two-fifths of them said that China&#8217;s Foreign Investment Law, which will come in effect on January 1, 2020, will have no impact on their existing operations in China, the survey found.</p>
<p>Many Western companies haven&#8217;t done any introspection facing rising competition in Chinese market and they often complain about others&#8217; &#8220;unfair competition&#8221; too much, so it is inevitable that these companies&#8217; market share will continue to decline, said Mei Xinyu, a research fellow at the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a>&#8216;s Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do not change this way of thinking, I believe their market share will continue to decline. State-owned enterprises have no special treatment different from other companies facing market competition, except of course, some major projects involving national security strategy and poverty alleviation,&#8221; Mei told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>China is adopting a more open approach to foreign investment, which will be welcomed by foreign companies and encourage them to invest more in China, said Edmund Yang, a PricewaterhouseCoopers partner in Beijing for global mobility services.</p>
<p>Yang told the Global Times on Tuesday that the new Foreign Investment Law will provide more flexibility to foreign financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My firm is in the services industry. More foreign companies increasing their investment in China will definitely help to generate more opportunities for us… and will be beneficial for the growth of the country&#8217;s economy as well,&#8221; said Yang.<br />
