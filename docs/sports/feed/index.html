<p>Lionel Messi playing for Barcelona claimed the 2019 Ballon d&#8217;Or here on Monday, making the record of winning the award for the sixth time. </p>
<p>Before the ceremony, both Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo had won the award for five times. </p>
<p>This time, Messi edged out Virgil Van Dijk, who helped Liverpool to win the title of the Champions League last season. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is 10 years since I won my first Ballon d&#8217;Or here in Paris and I remember coming here with my three brothers, I was 22 and it was all unthinkable for me what I was going through,&#8221; Messi said at the ceremony. </p>
<p>&#8220;Now 10 years on this is my sixth, in a very different time, very special in my personal life with my wife and three children.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware of the age I have but I hope I have several years left to keep enjoying my football and doing this.&#8221; Messi added. </p>
<p> <br />

<p>The Argentine had won the FIFA Men&#8217;s Player of the Year award in September, and he was the top scorer in the Champions League last season with 12 goals before Barcelona were beaten by Liverpool in the semifinals. </p>
<p>The 32-year-old striker also won the European Golden Shoe after scoring 36 goals, claimed La Liga title with Barcelona, and helped Argentina to get bronze at 2019 Copa America. </p>
<p>Juventus&#8217; forward Cristiano Ronaldo had also been shortlisted for the award, but did not attend the ceremony. </p>
<p>Megan Rapinoe won the Ballon d&#8217;Or for the best female player of the year. She led the United States to win the World Cup in France in July. </p>
<p>The 34-year-old Rapinoe also won the FIFA Women&#8217;s Player of the Year award, and she won the Golden Boot for being top scorer and the Golden Ball for the best player at the World Cup. </p>
<p>Dutch Matthijs de Ligt, who played as a defender for Serie A club Juventus and the Netherlands national team, won Kopa Trophy, the award presented to the best player under the age of 21. </p>
<p>Brazilian Alisson Becker, goalkeeper of Liverpool, won Yashin Trophy, which presented for the first time to the best goalkeeper of the year.</p>

<p>Kenyans placed first in the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s races during Sunday&#8217;s Nanning Marathon in the capital of South China&#8217;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>Kiura Mugendi won the men&#8217;s 42.195-kilometer race in 2:16:57, while his compatriot Flavious Kwamboka won the women&#8217;s race in 2:45:29.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were also good achievements by domestic athletes, as Wei Guochao and Bao Yuekun finished second and third in the men&#8217;s half marathon race, while Deng Yufang won the women&#8217;s half marathon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The marathon, held annually since 2006, has become a magnet for distance runners in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Yang Xuemin, chief of the Nanning Sports Bureau, said about 40,000 runners applied to enter the Nanning race, and 28,000 runners participated in Sunday&#8217;s race.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The marathon is a qualifier race for runners over the age of 40 to enter the World Marathon Majors (WMM) in 2021, organizers said. Currently only four marathon races in China serve as a WMM qualifier event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WMM includes prestigious marathons in London, Tokyo, Boston, Chicago, New York and Berlin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nanning has established itself as a sports city after hosting the World Gymnastics Championships, Cup of China football tournament and badminton&#8217;s Surdiman Cup among other sporting events.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Matthias Mayer won the first super-G of the men&#8217;s alpine ski season Sunday, edging the discipline&#8217;s reigning World Cup champion Dominik Paris at Lake Louise.</p>
<p>In bright sunshine Mayer, who won the 2014 Olympic downhill gold and super-G gold at the Pyeongchang Games in 2018, clocked 1 minute 31.40 seconds to notch his first win in the Canadian Rockies &#8211; where he had three runner-up finishes between 2013 and 2015.</p>
<p>The Austrian&#8217;s sixth World Cup victory was his third super-G win &#8211; and his first in the discipline on the World Cup circuit since January 2017.</p>
<p>It put him in the lead in the overall standings with 161 points &#8211; just one point in front of Paris who was second in 1:31.80.</p>
<p>Italy&#8217;s Paris, who won three World Cup super-G races last season, was the seventh man out of the gate.</p>
<p>He appeared to have picked up where he left off when he powered into the lead, overtaking Switzerland&#8217;s Mauro Caviezel.</p>
<p>But he was knocked out of the top spot by Mayer, with Caviezel finishing the day tied for third with Austrian Vincent Kriechmayr in 1:31.89.</p>
<p>Paris settled for his second runner-up finish of the weekend.</p>
<p>He was edged in Saturday&#8217;s downhill by German Thomas Dressen, who ­posted a stunning comeback victory exactly a year to the day after a crash at Beaver Creek ended his 2018-19 season.</p>
<p>Dressen capped his return from ­injury with a 10th-place finish in the super-G.</p>
<p>Mayer&#8217;s victory ended seven years of Norwegian dominance at Lake Louise. Since 2011, now-retired Aksel Lund Svindal and his compatriot Kjetil Jansrud had ruled the Super-G at the Canadian resort.</p>
<p>Jansrud, winner of the Lake Louise super-G the past two years, finished eighth.</p>
<p>The men now travel to Beaver Creek, Colorado, for a super-G, downhill and giant slalom on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>Former New Zealand coach Steve Hansen confirmed Monday he is taking up a role with the Toyota Verblitz in Japan&#8217;s Top League.</p>
<p>Hansen&#8217;s tenure with the All Blacks ended after they finished third at the Rugby World Cup in Japan, where they beat Wales 40-17 in the bronze-­medal match.</p>
<p>In a video statement, Hansen said his role with Toyota Verblitz would be more as a consultant rather than a coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a new job which involves me mentoring, consulting and advising at Toyota Verblitz,&#8221; Hansen said, confirming widespread speculation that he had taken up an offer to work in Japan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not as a head coach, it&#8217;s more as an adviser, a mentor, and it requires me to be up there for five to 17 weeks a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is the second big All Blacks signing for Verblitz after Kieran Read, who ended his 127-Test international career after the World Cup, announced earlier this year he was also moving there.</p>
<p>The highly acclaimed Hansen, who was the All Blacks head coach when they won the World Cup in 2015 and an assistant coach when they won in 2011, will be working alongside former New South Wales ­Waratahs assistant Simon Cron who is now the Verblitz head coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity to help him grow is something that ­really excites me,&#8221; Hansen said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;While we want a winning Toyota Verblitz team, we also want an environment at the club that people can be proud of and that is very much like a family, like the sort of thing we had in the All Blacks.&#8221;</p>

Photo: AFP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spin king Nathan Lyon snared five wickets, including dangerous half-century makers Shan Masood and Asad Shafiq, as Australia wore down a stubborn Pakistan to clinch the second Test and wrap up the series 2-0 Monday.</p>
<p>Pakistan resumed Day 4 of the day-night match on a precarious 39 for three with Masood not out 14 and Shafiq on eight after being bowled out for 302 in their first innings and forced to follow on.</p>
<p>It followed Australia&#8217;s mammoth 589 for three declared, built around David Warner&#8217;s exceptional 335 not out &#8211; the 10th highest Test score of all time.</p>
<p>Needing another 248 to force Australia to bat again and avoid a second successive innings defeat, they had a decent crack but were eventually all out for 239 with the home team claiming victory by an innings and 48 runs.</p>
<p>It was Australia&#8217;s sixth consecutive win in a pink ball Test &#8211; four of them at Adelaide &#8211; with every day-night Test played so far since the concept was introduced in 2015 producing a result.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really happy. Barring few slip-ups in the field yesterday, we played excellent cricket in the last two matches,&#8221; said Australia captain Tim Paine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;David and Marnus [Labuschagne] have been unbelievably good. We all witnessed a special knock from David&nbsp;Warner. It is among the top one or two innings ever by an Australian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyon was Australia&#8217;s savior, finishing with 5-69 on a lifeless pitch that offered little for the home side&#8217;s fast bowlers, who were made to toil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was his 16th five-wicket haul and his first against Pakistan, who have lost all four Tests they have played this year after two defeats to South Africa in January.</p>
<p>Defeat continued Pakistan&#8217;s appalling record in Australia, where they have now crashed in 14 consecutive Tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to congratulate Australia and especially David Warner,&#8221; said Pakistan skipper Azhar Ali.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been beaten by a better team. We will take some positives from here. As a bowling unit, we need to control the scoring rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least they offered some resistance on Monday, with Masood, who models himself on England&#8217;s Alastair Cook, playing some glorious strokes as he assumed a leadership role after Babar Azam and captain Azhar Ali fell cheaply on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>His sixth Test 50, in his 17th Test, arrived with a boundary off Lyon, his sixth four, before he chipped the spinner to mid-off on 68 where Mitchell Starc collected an easy catch.</p>
<p>Shafiq, who has 12 Test hundreds to his name, proved to be Masood&#8217;s equal and brought up his 25th half-century with a single off Josh Hazlewood.</p>
<p>But Lyon struck again, with Shafiq getting a thin edge to a flighted ball that carried to ­Warner at slip and he was gone for 57.</p>
<p>Lyon then removed Iftikhar Ahmed, caught at short leg by Labuschagne for a battling 27, before trapping surprise first-innings century-maker Yasir Shah lbw for 13.</p>
<p>Shaheen Afridi became his fifth victim, caught at mid-off by Hazlewood on the last ball before dinner.</p>
<p>The new pink ball was taken when they returned and with the lights on it didn&#8217;t take long to finish off the tail, with Hazlewood clean-bowling Mohammad Rizwan for 45 and Mohammad Abbas run out.</p>
<p>It capped another commanding victory for Australia who exploited Pakistan&#8217;s inexperienced bowling attack, which includes two teenagers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luka Doncic finished just shy of a triple-double as the Dallas Mavericks gave the Los Angeles Lakers a reality check Sunday by snapping their 10-game win streak with a 114-100 win.</p>
<p>Doncic was just one rebound short of the triple double finishing with 27 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds, as the visiting Mavericks avenged a 119-110 overtime loss to Los Angeles one month ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great win that means a lot to us,&#8221; Doncic, 20, said. &#8220;It shows that we can play against big teams, too. We just need to keep it rolling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first-place Mavericks improved to 13-6 on the season and were too much to handle for the Lakers, whose win streak came against 10 teams, all with losing records.</p>
<p>The last time Los Angeles played a team with a better than .500 record, which was the ­Toronto Raptors on November 10, they lost 113-104.</p>
<p>Delon Wright came off the bench to tally 17 points and nine assists while Dwight Powell, Kristaps Porzingis and Justin Jackson contributed 15 points apiece in the win.</p>
<p>Anthony Davis had 27 points and 10 rebounds and LeBron James tallied 25 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for Los Angeles. James also had six of the Lakers 17 turnovers.</p>
<p>The Lakers&#8217; next two games are against Denver and Utah, who are one and two atop the Northwest Division standings.</p>
<p>Kyle Kuzma shot just one of 13 from the floor while Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo each scored just four points as the Mavericks&#8217; bench outscored the Lakers&#8217; reserve 43-29.</p>
<p>Dallas used a brilliant third quarter to seize command of the game.</p>
<p>Doncic, who was bloodied and muscled off the ball several times in the November loss to the Lakers, held his ground on Sunday, scoring 16 of his points in the third quarter.</p>
<p>In Toronto, Pascal Siakam scored 35 points and the Toronto Raptors turned a 40 point halftime lead into a 130-110 win over the Utah Jazz.</p>
<p>Fred VanVleet added 21 points and 11 assists for the Raptors, who are a club record 9-0 at home to open the season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also are on a season-best seven-game winning streak overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Conley had 20 points for the Jazz, who have lost three of their past four games on a five-game road trip.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Chris Paul scored seven of his 16 points late in the fourth quarter of the Oklahoma City Thunder&#8217;s 107-104 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chances of a joint British and Irish bid to host the 2030 World Cup have grown after officials agreed to ramp up preparations, according to the general manager of the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).</p>
<p>The English FA, which has been leading a feasibility study, presented the findings to other associations at a meeting before the Euro 2020 draw on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The feasibility study is positive and there&#8217;s a sense that the right thing to do is go forward,&#8221; FAI general manager Noel Mooney told The Times. &#8220;This bid is out on the front foot and very well led by the guys from the English FA who gave a very strong presentation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Times reported the joint bid would have matches played in several English cities, alongside Cardiff, Glasgow and Dublin, with the final to be staged at London&#8217;s Wembley Stadium.</p>
<p>The funding body UK Sport, which advises the government on which bids to support, said last year that hosting the 2030 World Cup in Britain would be a &#8220;crowning achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay have announced a four-way bid which could have sentimental value as Uruguay hosted the inaugural World Cup in 1930.</p>
<p>China would be among the contenders if FIFA decides to change the rules on how the World Cup is rotated between regions.</p>
<p>Asian countries are ruled out from hosting in 2030 because Qatar will stage the 2022 World Cup and current regulations prevent the same region from hosting either of the subsequent two tournaments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deshaun Watson passed for three touchdowns and caught another as the Houston Texans beat the New England Patriots for the first time in a decade with a 28-22 win on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Texans last win over New England came in January 2010 as they maintained their one-game lead atop the AFC South Division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a big one,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;We can play with the top teams in the NFL.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson also welcomed the opportunity to go head to head with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and come out on top.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the [greatest of all time],&#8221; he said of Brady.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is special for me. Before he hangs it up I had to at least get one [win] on him. I had to get this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson, who finished 18 of 25 for 234 yards, is just the third player since 1970 to have three touchdown passes and a touchdown catch in the same game.</p>
<p>Watson scored the first receiving touchdown of his career when he snared a flip pass from teammate DeAndre Hopkins as the Texans trick play worked in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>His 14-yard touchdown pass to Duke Johnson with 38 seconds left in the first quarter gave the Texans the lead for good.</p>
<p>Brady completed 42 of 47 passes for 326 yards.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Justin Tucker booted a 49-yard field goal as time expired to lift the Baltimore Ravens to an eighth straight NFL victory Sunday, 20-17 over the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>In a clash of Super Bowl contenders, Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson completed just 14 of 23 passes for 105 yards in rainy weather that he admitted &#8220;messed with me a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he ran for 101 yards and a touchdown to help the Ravens improve to 10-2 for the first time in franchise history.</p>
<p>Tucker&#8217;s game-winner was his 38th straight fourth-quarter field goal, the longest active streak in the league.</p>
<p>The Ravens had taken over at their 35-yard line with 6:28 to play and advanced just nine yards on their first three plays.</p>
<p>Going for it on fourth down, Jackson got the first down on a quarterback sneak as the Ravens put Tucker in range.</p>
<p>As playoff contenders wrestled for position in week 13 of the season, the Cincinnati Bengals grabbed their first win of 2019 with a 22-6 victory over the New York Jets.</p>
<p>Quarterback Andy Dalton, benched a month ago, returned to lead the Bengals, who snapped an 11-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Dalton completed 22 of 37 passes for 243 yards and a touchdown and the Bengals defense held the Jets &#8211; who had scored 34 points in each of their last three games &#8211; to two field goals.</p>
<p>The Jets became the first team in NFL history to lose twice in one season to teams with records of 0-7 or worse.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Green Bay&#8217;s Aaron Rodgers threw for 243 yards and four touchdowns without an interception in the Packers&#8217; 31-13 win over the New York Giants.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi delivered a major boost to Barcelona&#8217;s La Liga title hopes by scoring a late winner in a 1-0 victory at Atletico Madrid on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;In matches that are close and intense, having Leo is always a big advantage,&#8221; said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde.</p>
<p>The Argentinian&#8217;s 86th-minute strike, after a neat one-two with Luis Suarez, keeps Barcelona level on points with Real Madrid at the top of the table while leaving Atletico with a mountain to climb if they are to rejoin the race.</p>
<p>Atletico now sit six points adrift of both Real and Barca, with those two also having a game in hand which will be played out in the season&#8217;s first Clasico at the Camp Nou on December 18.</p>
<p>It means Atleti could conceivably head into the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> break nine points off the lead, a significant gap, particularly considering they will have to play away against both Barca and Real Madrid in the second half of the season.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need points,&#8221; said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. &#8220;We are not far from them but we are worried. I am happy with the way we are playing but I will not smile at that because that does not bring us points.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antoine Griezmann was whistled on his return to his former club, whom he left for 120 million euros ($132.3 million) to join Barcelona in the close season, while toy rats were dropped on the plaque that still bears his name outside the stadium.</p>
<p>But Messi scored his 12th goal of the season and sixth in his last five games. He has now 25 in 27 in the league against Atletico although this was his first at the Wanda Metropolitano.</p>
<p>Barcelona were fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men in the second half when Gerard Pique escaped a second yellow card for a late challenge on Alvaro Morata.</p>
<p>They rode their luck in the opening 20 minutes too, marooned in their own half and able only to survive thanks in large part to their goalkeeper.</p>
<p>Marc-Andre ter Stegen made two excellent point-blank saves although was given the chance to as Mario Hermoso found himself free at the back post but shot straight at him before Morata met Kieran Trippier&#8217;s corner but failed to head into the corner.</p>
<p>There had been little Ter Stegen could do about Hermoso hitting the post early on as his pullback was diverted almost disastrously by Barca left-back Junior Firpo but somehow stayed out.</p>
<p>Earlier, third-placed Sevilla stayed just one point behind Real and Barca with a 1-0 victory over Leganes. Julen Lopetegui&#8217;s side extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 10 matches as Brazilian centerback Diego Carlos bundled in a 63rd-minute winner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liverpool opened up an 11-point gap at the top of the Premier League on Saturday when the old adage that title winners churn out victories even when not at their best had a special ring.</p>
<p>A couple of hours after champions Manchester City dropped two points at Newcastle United in a 2-2 draw, Liverpool scraped out a 2-1 win over Brighton and Hove Albion despite having goalkeeper Alisson red-carded.</p>
<p>It took Juergen Klopp&#8217;s relentless leaders to 40 points from 14 games after 13 wins and a draw with City on 29, the same as Leicester City who host Everton on Sunday.</p>
<p>Chelsea&#8217;s grip on fourth place suddenly looks a little less tight as they suffered a first home defeat by West Ham United for seven years, Aaron Cresswell&#8217;s goal sealing a 1-0 win for the Hammers who had lost five of their last six games.</p>
<p>Frank Lampard&#8217;s side have 26&nbsp;points, six ahead of Jose Mourinho&#8217;s resurgent Tottenham Hotspur who claimed successive league wins for the first time since April as they beat Bournemouth 3-2 with Dele Alli twice on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>All was calm at Anfield when Dutch central defender Virgil van Dijk scored two first-half headers against Brighton, but the second 45 minutes was anything but comfortable.</p>
<p>Brighton had shown some threat and when Alisson rushed out of his goal in the 76nd minute and blatanly handled there was no option but to send him off &#8211; a rush of blood that will rule him out of the Merseyside derby.</p>
<p>The immediate problem for Liverpool was that Lewis Dunk&#8217;s cheeky free kick beat sub keeper Adrian, prompting panic in the home ranks that Brighton looked capable of exploiting.</p>
<p>Liverpool hung on but were breathing a sigh of relief at the final whistle as Klopp&#8217;s side stretched the club&#8217;s unbeaten league run to 31.</p>
<p>City have now won only once in their last five games in all competitions and will be kicking themselves after twice leading at struggling Newcastle.</p>
<p>Raheem Sterling&#8217;s 22nd-minute strike was quickly cancelled out by Jetro Willems but when Kevin de Bruyne&#8217;s sledgehammer shot restored their lead late on it seemed the points were in the bag before Liverpool player Jonjo Shelvey&#8217;s superb curling effort left them frustrated.</p>
