<p>China is not Mexico. It&#8217;s impossible that the US can strike a trade deal with China by forcing Beijing to make big compromises, as the US did to Mexico when it came to the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump on Tuesday retweeted a post from US Representative Mike Kelly, who claimed that the USMCA is &#8220;a big win.&#8221; The Financial Times said Trump&#8217;s &#8220;disruptive approach to trade&#8221; is delivering results at a time of heightened commercial tensions with China and the EU. Some have linked the USMCA to the ongoing trade row with China, and they hope the new North American deal can be used as a model to pressure Beijing to accept US trade policy.</p>
<p>The USMCA requires 40-45 percent of auto content to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. The rule is likely to boost manufacturing in the US, where wages are higher than in Mexico. According to Mexico News Daily, just 0.5 percent of 53.8 million workers in Mexico earn $16 or more per hour. The deal casts a cloud over the auto industry in Mexico.</p>
<p>Why did Mexico accept a deal that may hit its auto industry? Mexico&#8217;s economy is highly dependent on the US. Some statistics showed about 80 percent of Mexico&#8217;s exports went to the US in 2018. This may show why the US can force Mexico to make compromises in trade talks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same scenario won&#8217;t play out in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington. China&#8217;s exports to the US account for 19 percent of its total exports of goods, far below the 80 percent recorded by Mexico. More importantly, China has a huge domestic market that can help offset the negative effects of the trade war as some Chinese exporters lose market share in the US. It&#8217;s very unlikely for Beijing to make compromises in trade talks with the US in the way that Mexico did.</p>
<p>Trump has remade the landscape of US trade policy since he came into office. The USMCA, which was touted by Trump as the best and most important trade deal ever made by the US, offers a window on his thinking about global trade. The deal requires 75 percent of auto content to be made in North America. The rule may exert an effect on not only Mexico but also China. Mexico is an important export destination of made-in-China auto content. The USMCA is likely to hit China&#8217;s auto sector and have an impact on the global manufacturing chain.</p>
<p>However, Trump can&#8217;t totally reshape the global industrial chain through his protectionist measures and &#8220;disruptive approach to trade.&#8221; Whether or not China and the US can reach a trade deal, the bilateral trade game is likely to continue. China will fight to the end to defend its interests and support free trade.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo taken on Dec. 10, 2019 shows a general view of the Syntagma Square decorated for the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> season in Athens, Greece. The festive season kicked off in Athens with the tree lighting ceremony on Syntagma Square on Tuesday. (Xinhua/Marios Lolos) </p>
<p>Just Eat shareholders are limbering up for a feast this Christmas as two suitors prepare rival menus to win over the UK food-delivery company.</p>
<p>In one corner of the kitchen is tech giant Prosus. The Amsterdam-listed group on Monday sweetened its all-cash offer to 740 pence ($9.59) per share, valuing Just Eat at 5.1 billion pounds ($6.7 billion). The new offer is just 4.2 percent better than its opening bid in October. But it still has the advantage of being higher than an all-share proposal from Takeaway.com. Based on the Dutch group&#8217;s share price on Monday morning, its bid is currently worth 691 pence per Just Eat share.</p>
<p>The two competing chefs have contrasting styles. Prosus boss Bob van Dijk warns that Just Eat faces slowing growth in the UK &#8211; which brings in half the company&#8217;s revenue &#8211; and pressure from rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats. Retooling the business will be expensive and is best done away from the scrutiny of public markets.&nbsp; By contrast, Takeaway.com Chief Executive Jitse Groen talks of giving shareholders a stake in a larger group. Just Eat&#8217;s board has so far sided with him, recommending that shareholders accept the Takeaway.com offer as it would create the largest food-delivery firm outside China.</p>
<p>The latest serving is unlikely to be the final helping. Just Eat shares were trading at 780 pence on Monday, well above Prosus&#8217; raised offer. That suggests investors are expecting the food fight to continue. Cat Rock Capital, which owns about 3 percent of Just Eat, said that Prosus&#8217; new offer continues to &#8220;dramatically undervalue&#8221; the company. The final course looks set to be served around Christmas, as the current deadline for both bidders to submit their final offers is set to be December 27. That means Takeaway.com probably needs to cook up a new offer. The Dutch group is already proposing to hand over more than half the company to Just Eat shareholders. Further improving those terms would risk knocking its own share price, undermining the benefits of the move. An alternative would be to find an outside investor to help it garnish the bid with some cash.</p>
<p>With just over two weeks to go, the pressure is on both bidders to come up with a more compelling Christmas gift.</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-11/39dcc4b9-04aa-4251-992b-90623c25b161.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT</p>
<p>The Chinese economy continues to slow down as it faces multiple pressures in 2019, but it is also showing resilience with the support of a complex set of stabilizing policies. Economic growth has remained in a rational and controllable range this year. 2020 will be a crucial year for China to secure a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, but the country will face greater challenges, particularly in the following six aspects.</p>
<p>First, external challenges will be more demanding. The global economic downturn and great-power competition have entered new phases, bringing about unprecedented uncertainty to global economic policies. This will not only directly impact China through trade, but it will also negatively influence the open economy by undermining market confidence. In 2020, external demand is expected to continue weakening, the global manufacturing industry is set to slump, China-US strategic competition will enter a new stage, and the 2020<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/US-election-2016/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US election</a> will bring further uncertainty to the prolonged trade war between the two countries.</p>
<p>Second, domestic demand is expected to remain weak and may accelerate the economic slowdown. China&#8217;s net exports have seen rapid growth this year, but domestic demand has experienced a significant decline. The economy is therefore more vulnerable and reliant on external demand, particularly when enterprises don&#8217;t expand their investment in production and residents don&#8217;t increase their consumption of durable goods. In the short term, China needs to stabilize foreign trade. The global economic slowdown will make it harder for China to maintain the rapid growth of net exports in 2020, and China must implement more targeted measures to boost domestic demand. More importantly, the decline in production investment does not just concern numbers, but also efficiency.</p>
<p>Third, the slowdown of economic growth may aggravate the current conditions of weak sectors and regions. As pressures mount for small and medium-sized enterprises, local financial risks may worsen. Changing economic structures in some regions may cause unemployment risks. In 2020, enterprises in eastern regions will find it difficult to turn a profit, and those in central regions should expect to see a further slowdown in the growth of revenue. Thus, employment will be at risk in certain regions and sectors. The automobile and mobile phone industries are still in steep decline. The real-estate, construction and information services industries have also contracted significantly. Downward sales and production in these industries mean that they face greater pressure when it comes to employment.</p>
<p>Fourth, the risk of a new round of deflation in the Chinese economy will increase in 2020, which deserves attention and requires preparation. Although the price of food &#8211; represented by pork &#8211; has risen sharply since the third quarter, driving the consumer price index (CPI) higher, this doesn&#8217;t mean that deflation will not occur next year. Instead, the continued falls of the non-food CPI, producer price index (<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/957593.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PPI</a>) and GDP deflator are highly similar to the initial performances of previous rounds of deflation. PPI trends from the fourth to the second quarter next year will need to be watched closely. Meanwhile, monetary policy needs to remain prudent.</p>
<p>Fifth, China should be wary of the risks that come with a structural rise in food prices &#8211; including pork &#8211; and weak overall demand. The prices of pork and other foods will continue to rise next year, leading to negative expectations in the market. Meanwhile, overall domestic demand will remain weak. These two factors are expected to have short-term impacts on the economy, causing severe problems for its macro-management in 2020.</p>
<p>Sixth, mitigated financial risks may recur in 2020. Although the financial sector is clearly moving to provide more support for the real economy, pressure from a poor monetary transmission mechanism still exists. And though financial risks have been mitigated this year, defaults will persist in the future. Particularly alongside the continued economic downturn, financial risks may appear repeatedly. Financial-risk mitigation and prevention will be the core focuses of macro-management next year.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT</p>
<p>As China-Africa economic and trade cooperation increases alongside the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, more Chinese companies are eager to jump into the African market, hoping to expand their market share and development space. Data shows that more than 3,000 Chinese companies are currently doing business in Africa, and their employees and projects are spreading through every country on the continent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the public image of Chinese companies operating in Africa has become increasingly complicated. The Chinese government and Chinese firms have long believed that the investment, construction and operation of these firms in Africa would greatly improve the living standards of African people. However, Chinese companies have been painted in a negative light by local media. They are portrayed to be selling low quality products and services, lacking in social responsibility, offering low salaries and disrespecting African employees. Some Western media have even described China as &#8220;neocolonialist&#8221; or a &#8220;rogue donor.&#8221;</p>
<p>This image results from the bias of Western countries which aim to gain a competitive advantage on the continent. In addition to international competition, Chinese companies cannot ignore the issue of how to build positive communication and a cooperative relationship with local media and people in Africa, thereby improving their public image. Against the backdrop of rising global protectionism and the US&#8217; perceived rivalry with China in Africa, Chinese companies need to work on their public image if they want to succeed amid the fierce competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese companies should pay more attention to mobilizing non-governmental organizations (NGOs). NGOs in African countries are well-developed, and each country has hundreds or thousands of them. They are deep-rooted and each has its own specialty. Together, they reflect local public opinions and demand. For these reasons, global development organizations pay great attention to them. For project conductors from developed countries, or independent aid recipients, local NGOs are important development cooperation partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Chinese companies tend to overlook the importance of local NGOs. For instance, the Zambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry is an organization that was founded to provide consultation and public relations services for companies doing business in Zambia. Hundreds of foreign-owned companies in Zambia are members, but no Chinese firms have joined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese companies should be advised to devote capital and non-capital support to local NGOs, using the expertise of local organizations to spruce up their own public image. They could fund NGOs which have independent goals, supporting their training and forums to enhance cooperation. Such NGOs possess relevant skills and knowledge in professional areas, and have established relationships with local people and organizations. Chinese companies could use NGOs to repair their negative local perception. These firms should also increase and strengthen systemic conversation and consultation or they should implement regular consultation mechanisms, and coordinate with African NGOs flexibly and professionally.</p>
<p>In addition to working with NGOs, Chinese companies can request help from local media and public relations agencies. The internet industry in Africa has developed rapidly, and burgeoning new media technologies now influence African people&#8217;s lives. Chinese companies, which lack engagement with those agencies, can utilize multiple platforms to close the gap between their operations and African people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies should first update their official websites, presenting examples of their social undertakings and responsibility through pictures and videos. Over the years, Chinese firms have made efforts to improve local welfare, giving back to African society. Many enterprises have built public facilities including schools and hospitals without publicizing their work. It is difficult for local people to realize that Chinese companies were involved in such projects.</p>
<p>Companies should also establish overseas social media accounts and contract local public relations services to operate and maintain them.</p>
<p>Chinese companies provided emergency aid during Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique in March, in concert with humanitarian aid provided by the Chinese government. This did not draw a great deal of local attention. The professional advantages of utilizing local media and public relations agencies could have helped build a more positive public image at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With protectionism and unilateralism worldwide, Chinese companies face tough competition. To continue the golden age of China-Africa economic cooperation, Chinese companies have to boost their competitiveness and form a healthy public image. It is only then that local people will realize Chinese companies are not moving to Africa to plunder it, but to make contributions to the continent and its people&#8217;s lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A Saudi Aramco plant Photo: IC</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia&#8217;s sale of its crown jewel always risked becoming a Greek tragedy. Ever since the Gulf Kingdom in 2016 decided on a public stock offering to sell 5 percent of Saudi Aramco, its main source of revenue and the world&#8217;s biggest oil producer, the interests of the seller and the anticipated horde of international investors have been on a collision course. A crash duly ensued.</p>
<p>Aramco&#8217;s ill-starred listing has been through four distinct stages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The genesis of the current strife came in 2017 when Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, insisted on a $2 trillion price tag for Aramco and had investment banks and exchanges around the world competing to make that happen.</p>
<p>That led to stasis, as the difficulties of achieving such a valuation and accommodating Aramco&#8217;s myriad environmental, social and governance headaches on a global bourse became clear. In mid-2018, things went quiet.</p>
<p>Bin Salman should have waited. Instead, he displayed hubris. Saudi overhauled Aramco&#8217;s leadership in September and then revived its IPO, despite a drone and missile strike &#8211; reported by Reuters to have been planned by Iran &#8211; that knocked out half its oil output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The predictable result was a sort of nemesis. Aramco slashed its price to $1.7 trillion and, after foreign investors largely held back, cut the size of its offering from 3 percent to 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>Reuters has been covering all the twists and turns of Aramco&#8217;s tortuous journey. That&#8217;s encompassed our own stab at a discounted cash-flow valuation, ongoing probes into where the company could conceivably list, and the masochistic experiences of foreign bankers, sentenced to months of Saturday flights to Aramco headquarters in Dhahran for a demanding client with little hope of fat fees.</p>
<p>Aramco got its deal away, with at least some non-Saudi interest and a book that in the end attracted 4.7 times the amount on offer. But the sale has come at the cost of leveraging its own citizens, companies and neighbors. That could end badly. Either way, Bin Salman&#8217;s Vision 2030 program to diversify the kingdom away from oil has had an imperfect beginning.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Xinhua/Zhan Yan</p>
<p>Could US agricultural imports curb inflation in China? Probably not. China&#8217;s shortage of pigs is a fact, which means the country&#8217;s pork imports will expand further. But Brazil, instead of the US, is likely to become the biggest beneficiary of China&#8217;s pork import expansion.</p>
<p>The spike of November&#8217;s consumer inflation was mainly attributed to rising food prices, particularly pork, which is a staple of the Chinese diet. Analysts estimate that holiday-season spending at the end of the year may push the demand for pork up further and pile more pressure on China to import US farm goods. However, those analysts are ignoring a fact: the US is not the only source of China&#8217;s pork imports. South American and European countries are likely to gain more from China&#8217;s increasing pork imports.</p>
<p>There is no need to read too deeply into November&#8217;s consumer inflation reading. Soaring pork prices have gradually slowed in recent weeks. From November 25 to December 1, the wholesale price of pork dropped 3 percent from the previous week, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a>. The current situation is not as severe as it was in the beginning of November.</p>
<p>China has stepped up efforts to stabilize hog production and ensure the country&#8217;s pork supply. Data from the Ministry of Commerce suggests such measures have begun to take effect. While China is reasonably seeking to boost its pork imports, the country will strive to expand domestic supply to meet pork demand and curb a further increase in pork prices.</p>

<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></p>
<p>An article calling to prevent economic growth from sliding below 6 percent has sparked debate among Chinese economists. The piece was published by Yu Yongding, an academician and senior fellow of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. With a gloomy world economic landscape and uncertainties brought about by the China-US trade war, the Chinese economy &#8211;&nbsp; with a 6 to 6.5 percent growth goal &#8211;&nbsp; has been under pressure. An ebbing economic growth and rising consumer price index have placed policymakers in a dilemma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Economists are debating whether to defend a 6 percent growth rate with a stimulus package or apply more reform measures to the Chinese economy, which would stabilize growth at 5 percent. The side of the debate which Yu belongs to believes China&#8217;s current priority should be maintaining a 6 percent growth rate with an expansionary fiscal policy and loose monetary policy. The other side argues that it is time for China to switch gears, focusing on long-term reform and changing the economic structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Han Yongwen, deputy director of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges</strong></p>
<p>The real pressure for economic growth is employment, and maintaining a 6 percent economic growth is vital. China&#8217;s economic development has suffered from increasing downward pressure since last year. Next year, multiple pressures will mount. Therefore, stable economic growth carries more significance. If the growth rate can be stabilized next year &#8211; after speeding up the pace of reforms and adjustment &#8211; the Chinese economy will enter a level period, and maintaining this will be the key to economic development.</p>
<p>The state of employment will be the real pressure on next year&#8217;s economic growth. Data shows that the number of college graduates will reach 8.7 million next year. Add that figure to recent graduates who have not yet secured jobs and a huge amount of job vacancies will be needed to absorb the excess labor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Liu Shijin, deputy head of the economic committee of the 13th Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference National Committee</p>
<p></strong>There are two basic facts that people should realize about the Chinese economy. The first is that the transfer from high-speed growth to the gradual decline was due to a shift in economic growth phases &#8211; from 10 percent high-speed growth to 5 percent medium-speed growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second basic fact is that monetary and fiscal policies will not change the potential growth rate. There have been voices calling for looser monetary policy. In fact, monetary policy has already become relatively loose in recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the current macroeconomic policy is relatively loose, adopting a stimulus policy or trying to beat the potential growth rate is like advance spending. Economic stimulus could trigger a steep drop, and China should be particularly wary of this possible outcome.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy has entered a medium-speed growth phase, which has a 5 to 6 percent GDP growth rate but it has not been stabilized. It could still fall by 1 percentage point in the next year or two. The pressure to maintain stable economic growth will be greater next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Old driving forces for growth &#8211; infrastructure, real estate and exports &#8211; have been lacking momentum. The Chinese economy has to look for new potential thrusts for medium-speed growth if it wants to prevent a drop below 5 percent. Therefore, next year&#8217;s focus should be on reforms and policy adjustment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shen Jianguang, chief economist of JD Finance</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintaining growth at 6 percent should not be China&#8217;s goal in 2020. The country has already adopted some stimulus measures, but the results have been insignificant. Policymakers have paid great attention to maintaining stable economic growth amid the current economic downturn, and have been utilizing countercyclical adjustment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this, Chinese economic data still appears weak. But does that mean China&#8217;s stimulus was ineffective? This is not the case. Without these policies, China&#8217;s economic growth could have already dropped below 6 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the external environment deteriorates beyond expectations, maintaining a 6 percent economic growth will not only be difficult, but unnecessary. China needs to deepen its reform and opening-up, avoiding the use of strong stimulus.</p>
<p>Next year will be an important year for reform. It will be difficult to maintain short-term, stable growth and promote long-term reform simultaneously. If reforms obtain substantial results, together with medium and long-term benefits &#8211; even if economic growth declines to 5 percent &#8211; it will be better than 6 percent achieved through heavy stimulus.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The Uber App is seen on an iPhone. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Solving an ugly problem requires admitting there is one in the first place. Uber Technologies on Thursday released data on the number of sexual assaults, fatal attacks and the like in the course of 2.3 billion US rides taken in 2017-18. A tally of thousands for such events is shocking. But the fact that the car-hailing firm is publishing its record can only help make Uber safer.</p>
<p>Over two years, the data shows that more than 6,000 sex-related assaults were reported and 19 fatalities occurred. By comparison, Uber says the New York Police Department received more than 1,100 complaints of sex offenses in the transit system from 2017-18. It&#8217;s hard to know how to interpret that, with 3.4 billion subway rides alone over the period reported by the city&#8217;s transit authority.</p>
<p>Credit Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi noted that reactions would range from surprise at the rarity of incidents to outrage at their frequency, and from praise for Uber&#8217;s efforts to raising brickbats. &#8220;They will all be right,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Publication could, for instance, prompt more consumers to file lawsuits over the company&#8217;s lapses. Rival Lyft, which is planning to issue its own safety report, is already embroiled in a lawsuit filed by several women claiming the firm ignored sexual-assault complaints.</p>
<p>Uber has a checkered history when it comes to the harassment of women within its corporate ranks. This is one reason Khosrowshahi was brought in to replace former boss Travis Kalanick. The firm has regularly been accused of lax background requirements for drivers, and a loophole allowing unvetted users to pretend to be approved drivers was one reason London recently declined to renew the company&#8217;s license, pending an appeal by Uber.</p>
<p>For all the ambiguities, though, Uber&#8217;s report achieves at least two things. First, it should force rivals to be more transparent. And it ensures the company is motivated to reduce the incidence of crime &#8211; as it did from 2017 to 2018 &#8211; by tightening background checks, adding security measures and providing training. Ideally Uber should aim for no sexual assaults or deaths. That&#8217;s beyond what&#8217;s possible, but measuring the challenge is one way to credibly tackle it.</p>
