<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Soaring pork prices in China continued to soften last week as the country rolled out multiple measures to stabilize hog production.</p>
<p>From Nov. 25 to 29, the average pork price index in 16 provincial-level regions tracked by the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/20.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Agriculture</a> and Rural Affairs came in at 40.95 yuan (about 5.8 U.S. dollars) per kg, down 3.5 percent week on week.</p>
<p>This is the third consecutive week that the pork price index has retreated since the beginning of November.</p>
<p>The price retreat came as the Chinese government has been taking multi-pronged measures to boost supply, including increasing subsidies to restore hog production, releasing frozen pork reserves and expanding pork imports.</p>
<p>The ministry urged related departments to put great emphasis on restoring hog production and take various measures to ensure pork supply and stabilize pork prices for the coming New Year and Spring Festival holidays.</p>
<p>Prices of pork, a staple meat in China, have been soaring in recent months, mainly affected by African swine fever and cyclical factors.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 3.8 percent year on year last month, mainly driven by soaring pork prices, which rose 101.3 percent year on year in October, contributing nearly two-thirds of the CPI growth.</p>

<p>Shao Hua, general manager of Heihe City Natural Gas Development Co., Ltd. of China Gas, said that the border city of Heihe still largely relies on coal for heat. With the Sino-Russian natural gas pipeline&#8217;s operation, the city now has access to a stable supply of clean energy.</p>
<p>Heihe has registered 30,000 households for switching to natural gas for heating. It will take one year to complete full coverage of the gas network in the city, according to the company.</p>

<p>Though China has witnessed slow economic growth amid the China-US trade war, it has stabilized its job market thanks to the country&#8217;s tertiary industries, which have created more positions during the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading efforts.</p>
<p>The country&#8217; s steady employment situation refutes claims by US President Donald Trump that China had lost 3 million jobs due to the trade war. Experts gave credit to the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading and the appearance of new forms of flexible employment, saying the stable job market shows the resilience of China&#8217;s economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies in tertiary sectors told the Global Times that they had created millions of new job opportunities over recent years, and they have great demand for professional talent in IT, procurement, operations and services to support development in the future.</p>
<p>Industry reports showed that live-streaming, a new industry rising amid the fast development of the country&#8217;s internet sector, has generated a total of 4 million new jobs for the country; the food delivery industry has generated over 20 million job opportunities in both direct and indirect forms &#8211; some of which haven&#8217;t yet been factored into the official National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the downward pressure on the economy, one of the main factors necessary to maintaining the stable job market is the function of tertiary industries as a reservoir of employment,&#8221; said NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong, noting that tertiary industries cover a broad spectrum, with a growing number of enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 55 percent of employed people worked in tertiary industries in China, NBS said on November 20.</p>
<p>More and more Chinese graduates hope to work in tertiary industries, in companies such as those working with cutting-edge technology or the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>23-year-old postgraduate student Zhang Yali is looking for a job in the internet industry in Beijing. Majoring in journalism and communications, she would prefer a product-operations or user-operations position in an internet company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having commenced her job hunt in August, Zhang has applied for eight jobs in large Chinese internet companies such as tech conglomerate Tencent and ride-hailing services provider Didi Chuxing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though Chinese internet companies had mass layoffs at the end of last year, I still want to enter this industry because it is a driving force for economic development and working in this industry will be promising,&#8221; Zhang said. She knows the work will be challenging and require staying up late, but the industry will enable her to catch up with the pace of China&#8217;s economic restructuring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first 10 months of the year, China created 11.93 million new urban jobs across the country, meeting 2019&#8217;s annual target of more than 11 million new urban jobs in advance of the deadline. The unemployment rate in urban areas dropped 0.1 percentage points to 5.1 percent in October, mainly due to the improving employment status of graduates, NBS said.</p>
<p>Li Chang&#8217;an, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said that the improving employment absorption capacity in the services industry had effectively resolved employment difficulties in secondary industries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China is steadfastly implementing its soybean revitalization plan with strong enforcement while expanding import sources in order to reduce reliance on the US, which was once China&#8217;s largest soybean import source, amid a prolonged trade war between the world&#8217;s two largest economies.</p>
<p>China launched its national soybean revitalization plan this spring, vowing to increase the total planting area to 9.33 million hectares in 2020 and raise output to 2,025 kilograms per hectare next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The execution power of the plan is strong,&#8221; Jiao Shanwei, editor-in-chief of grain news website cngrain.com, told the Global Times. He said the strong enforcement of the policy is related to China&#8217;s fast reaction to the trade war with the US and a fast-tracking of work by the Heilongjiang provincial government.</p>
<p>In 2017, the total planting area of soybeans in China was only about 8.25 million hectares, but the figure surged to 8.46 million hectares in 2018 and reached more than 8.67 million hectares in 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhu Yuebin and local farmers at the Daxijiao Farm No.5 management area harvested 2,400 tons of soybeans from an 882-hectare section of land this October. The farm is located in the Jiusan State Farms area in Heilongjiang, the main soybean-producing area in China. Zhu, who manages the farm, told the Global Times that local farmers are enthusiastic to grow soybeans this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;2019&#8217;s subsidies for soybean growers reached 3,825 yuan ($543.90) per hectare, much higher than the subsidies for corn growers, which are 450 yuan per hectare,&#8221; Zhu said, adding that, under the encouragement of the national soybean revitalization plan, his farm is going to add another 243 hectares of land to grow soybeans next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the national policy, Zhu said farmers also take the soybean market into consideration, and noted that this year&#8217;s soybean price is higher than last year&#8217;s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though the rain is heavy this year and the temperature is low, which is bad for growing soybeans, it&#8217;s great for us to harvest such an abundant amount,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to statistics the Jiusan State Farms area sent to the Global Times, the total planting area of soybeans expanded to 169,467 hectares this year from 128,333 hectares in 2018, up 32 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Ukraine all pay close attention to China&#8217;s soybean market. China said in November that it is seeking to buy 3.7 million tons of soybeans from Russia by 2024.</p>
<p>From July to September, China increased the quantity of soybeans imported from diverse sources, statistics from the General Administration of Customs showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, the quantity of imported soybeans grew 8.4 percent year-on-year. It grew 3.6 percent in August and 2.3 percent in September. October witnessed a decline of 10.7 percent compared with last October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heilongjiang harvested soybeans in September and October.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one of the hardest years for China, it&#8217;s a year full of change, it&#8217;s the year of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the year, China&#8217;s economy has endured a battle that hardly anyone had expected its toughness, showing high level of resilience. China fine tuned its policy, diversified industrial supply chains and deepened partnerships with more countries to successfully sail through a bitter trade war and global meltdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such adjustments are proven to be far more than effective, according to assorted economic data released recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s strategy has seen a shift this year. At first, policies had been churching out, focusing extensively on cutting costs and stabilizing foreign trade. Then, it dialed inward in boosting consumption. As the year&#8217;s end nears, China readjusted policy directions to beef up measures in optimizing business environment to sustain and attract investment,&#8221; Gao Lingyun, an Chinese Academy of Social Sciences expert, told the Global Times over the weekend.</p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called for more efforts to create a market-oriented and law-based business environment, according to a statement released after a State Council executive meeting chaired by Li. The foreign investment law is set to take effect on January 1, 2020.</p>
<p>Experts close to the government told the Global Times China is proceeding in a way to have a plan first and then implement it in a flexible manner. The country&#8217;s leadership and the general public are accepting the trade war with the US as a given fact and dealing it with a palpable level of calm and confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;At first, China indeed worried and responded passively. But now we&#8217;re taking the initiative and are comfortable with our own tempo and schedule,&#8221; Gao said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under a governing philosophy of preserving economic resilience while normalizing higher tariffs, China pursued goals step by step steadfastly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;China has an institutional edge over other Western countries including the US. Unlike their political system, which is crowded by conflicting opinions, we work together and we&#8217;re united &#8211; this is our biggest advantage,&#8221; Gao said. &#8220;The longer the trade war last, the bigger advantage we have in hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, China&#8217;s Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index rose to 51.8 from 51.7 in October, the fastest expansion since December 2016.</p>
<p>The unexpected expansion reflects the revival of industrial output and robust domestic economic growth underpinned by rising and consumption trends. It provides a contrasting reality to US President Donald Trump&#8217;s poor characterization on Chinese economy.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial chain diversification</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trade war, which Trump initiated, with China is in its 18th month now, despite negotiation. Huawei has been one of the US government&#8217;s targets in its tech blockade of China. The blacklisting cut off crucial US components suppliers to the Chinese company.</p>
<p>Huawei responded by launching its self-developed operating system HarmonyOS in August, providing a vivid example of how China is&nbsp; scaling up efforts to reduce reliance on US in the long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exporters based in Yiwu, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province,&nbsp; the world&#8217;s largest wholesale market, told the Global Times that diversification in markets had been underway since last year, under which orders to other countries in Europe and along the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative are taking shape.</p>
<p>Ying Daijun, chairman of Shifeng Decorative Lighting Co in Yiwu, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, told the Global Times that the company&#8217;s light exports to US now account for a negligible share of overall exports, while exports to India have soared to account for 40 percent of total revenue, the largest share.</p>
<p>The US was the company&#8217;s largest export destinations last year. &#8220;The US retailers are more desperate to call for the removal of tariffs than we are. And we&#8217;re fully prepared if trade conflicts further escalate,&#8221; Ying said.</p>

<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></p>
<p><i>All eyes are on the possibility of China&#8217;s GDP growth falling below 6 percent in 2020. What if China&#8217;s GDP growth falls below 6 percent in 2020, as the prolonged China-US trade war and a slowing global economy continue to cast a shadow on the country&#8217;s economic growth? Leading Chinese economists and China market watchers are unfazed by concerns over whether or not the world&#8217;s second-largest economy can hold the psychological 6 percent growth level, showed a new poll from the Global Times released on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roughly half of the respondents of a GT Source poll of 22 leading Chinese economists and China market watchers opted for a greater than 50 percent chance of the economy growing at a pace of below 6 percent in the next year. The other half chose the other side of the China growth coin &#8211; the probability of below-6-percent growth would be less than 50 percent.</p>
<p>Among the poll respondents were Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Digits; Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC; Hong Hao, managing director and head of research at BOCOM International; Zhang Yansheng, chief research fellow with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE); Sheng Songcheng, former head of the statistics and analysis department of the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBC), China&#8217;s central bank; and Yao Yang, dean of the National School of Development of Peking University.</i></p>
<p>China&#8217;s economy faces pressure to maintain 6 percent growth in 2020, but optimism about the economy prevails among leading Chinese economists and China market watchers. They&#8217;re unfazed by concerns over whether the world&#8217;s second-largest economy can hold the key level of support or not, the findings of a new poll from the Global Times showed on Monday.</p>
<p>The survey results indicated that views are about evenly split when it comes to maintaining 6-percent GDP growth or embracing a sub-6 percent growth rate.</p>
<p>The poll included respondents from leading Chinese and foreign banks, government-affiliated think tanks, private research institutes and venture capital firms, giving a valuable look inside the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a high probability that [the economy will grow at a pace] of 6 percent or above,&#8221; Zhang at CCIEE said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chance of the economy slipping below 6 percent would be less than 50 percent, according to Sheng, a former PBC official and currently adjunct professor of economics and finance at the China Europe International Business School. He said that the economy is heading for a rebound next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s economy expanded by 6 percent in the third quarter of 2019, the weakest quarterly figure since 1992 when official records began, official data showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Dong Ximiao, chief analyst at Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute, put it, the Chinese economy has bottomed out, meaning &#8220;there&#8217;s no room left for economic indicators to move further down, and there are already signs of marginal improvements in the economy.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those choosing the other side of the coin, instead of voicing pessimism, have favored a market-oriented growth trajectory that may sometimes fluctuate widely, over an obsession with pushing growth into a 6-percent range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting the odds of falling below 6 percent at 80 percent, Hong at BOCOM International said that the structure of the economy has changed with the services sector contributing massively to economic growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking GDP numbers to heart is reminiscent of the past when Chinese people lived in a planned economy, he told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The planned economy was shown to be dwelling on whether we managed to grow the economy by a certain percentage so as to reach a certain economic size,&#8221; Hong said, noting that such a mindset goes against market orientation as it risks leading to a substantial resource misallocation.</p>
<p>A numerical approach to economic policymaking ought to be abandoned, argued the head of research at BOCOM International, who forecast that sub-6 percent growth would be normal in years to come.</p>
<p>In a research note sent to the Global Times in late November, Goldman Sachs economists led by Andrew Tilton expected China&#8217;s economic growth in 2020 to be marginally lower at 5.8 percent compared with 6.1 percent estimated for the whole of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang Tao, chief China economist of UBS, predicted in a note sent to the Global Times in mid-November that China&#8217;s GDP growth would stabilize at 5.7 percent in 2020 and 5.6 percent in 2021.</p>
<p>Jing Linbo, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Evaluation Studies, one of the poll respondents voting for a greater than 50 percent chance, said &#8220;it&#8217;s already quite difficult for China&#8217;s economy, of such a gigantic size, to maintain a growth rate of above 6 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the economy shifting toward more balanced growth, a slowdown in GDP expansion is a well-accepted scenario, Jing commented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the words of Hong, slower growth hasn&#8217;t and won&#8217;t become a source of concern.</p>
<p>The nation&#8217;s transition away from a labor-intensive growth model and toward its thriving internet sector has created a multitude of non-traditional jobs such as individual vendors on Taobao that have yet to be included in the official job market survey, he stressed. Every percentage of China&#8217;s GDP growth now creates many more jobs than was the case previously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another sign of the economy&#8217;s resilience, the Chinese mainland equity market has posted an impressive performance for the whole of the year, remarked Hong, also chief strategist at BOCOM International.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shanghai Composite Index finished up 0.13 percent at 2,875.81 points on Monday. The flagship index had risen by 15.31 percent as of Monday since the beginning of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />India telecom companies have raised tariff between 15-40 percent across different plans effective from this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our new mobile plans offer tremendous value to our customers and are backed by a superior network experience on Airtel&#8217;s nationwide 4G network,&#8221; said Shashwat Sharma, chief marketing officer, Bharti Airtel, the third largest mobile network operator in India on late Sunday.</p>
<p>Vodafone Idea, the second largest telecom operator in India, too made a statement announcing revised tariffs, which will be effective Tuesday along with Bharti Airtel, while Reliance Jio, which leads the list as the Indian telecom company said it will be introducing new plans with unlimited voice and data effective December 6.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although, the new all-in-one plans will be priced up to 40 per cent higher, staying true to its promise of being customer-first, Reliance Jio customers will get up to 300 percent more benefits,&#8221; Reliance Jio said in a release.</p>
<p>According to a recent study, India has the cheapest mobile data in the world with 1GB costing just 0.26 U.S. dollars as compared to global average of about 8.36 U.S. dollars. The average price of 0.26 dollars for one gigabyte (GB) in India compares to 6.66 dollars in the UK and 12.37 dollars for the same amount of data in the U.S., the study, which compared mobile data charges across 230 countries, said.</p>
<p>The revised tariff comes at the backdrop of telecom companies reporting huge losses in its July-September quarter following an adverse ruling by India&#8217;s apex court &#8212; the Supreme Court on adjusted gross revenue.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Vodafone Idea raised equity funds to the extent of 3.6 billion U.S. dollars while an equal amount was raised by Bharti Airtel to tide over the price war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio two years back.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">China Mobile tests 5G network of over 1,000 Mbps in Qingdao, East China&#8217;s Shandong Province, in October. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>News that a Chinese visiting scholar lost contact for two days during a trip to a forest due to a poor mobile phone connection has gone viral on Chinese social media, with users teasing the low quality of mobile coverage in the US and analysts stressing the importance of Huawei to the country&#8217;s telecoms development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese visiting scholar Wang Mianmian, who visited a forest on Friday and soon after lost contact, was reported missing to police by her family, according to a media report.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Wang on Monday was able to reconnect to her mobile network, posting on her Wechat moments, &#8220;I am back, no worries, I did not notice the mobile phone connection in the US is poor. Sorry for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s experience later spread across Chinese social media, with users complaining about the poor mobile phone connection in the US and criticizing the telecoms construction from capital-driven carriers in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;The telecoms development in the US is relatively lagging. It is ok in major cities, but the mobile phone connection in some rural areas is very poor or even non-existent,&#8221; a user of Chinese news aggregator Jinri Toutiao said in a comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citing the example of the Yellow Stone National Park, the user said that there is no connection in most of the park, and if one can be found, it is hard to even make a phone call for help.</p>
<p>A Sina Weibo user said that, unlike China&#8217;s national construction model that takes less-populated rural areas under same consideration as large cities, the capital-driven construction in the US has made a different choice.</p>
<p>The user&#8217;s comment was echoed by an industry analyst.</p>
<p>Wang&#8217;s incident also shows that the telecoms construction in the US cannot continue without Huawei, a Chinese telecoms solution provider that has been facing challenges in the US, Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major telecoms carriers, who are capital-oriented companies, mostly focus on highly populated areas rather than rural regions, so the telecoms construction in less-populated areas generally needs to rely on small, local carriers,&#8221; Xiang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;But these small carriers usually don&#8217;t have enough capital to build optical-fiber-based networks. It is almost the case that only Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE can provide affordable alternative solutions for them, so they cannot leave Huawei,&#8221; Xiang added.</p>
<p>According to Xiang, thus far, there are roughly 12 million mobile network base stations globally, including 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G stations, of which China has about 8 million and the US about 400,000. China has more than 4 million 4G stations while the US has roughly 200,000.</p>

<p>Mobile payments with facial-recognition technology can now be used to board the intercity train between Guangzhou and Shenzhen in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province. The technology will reduce the time it takes to carry out identification checks and ensure that passengers themselves have bought their tickets, instead of ticket scalpers, media reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>It takes three seconds to scan a code on your WeChat app. Then you can pass the ticket gate and take the Guangzhou-Shenzhen intercity train, saving at least 15 minutes. Payment is made via WeChat Pay.</p>
<p>Before taking the train, passengers can register in the WeChat mini-program &#8220;Guangdong-Shenzhen intercity pass&#8221; for identification authentication and facial recognition, chinanews.com reported on Sunday, citing the head of the passenger department of China Railway Guangzhou Group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After successfully registering, passengers can use a code on WeChat to enter and exit the station. Payment will be taken upon departure from the station.</p>
<p>According to the company, the Guangzhou-Shenzhen intercity railway runs 85 pairs of trains, carrying 106,000 passengers every day.&nbsp;</p>
