<p>About 51.3 percent of China&#8217;s GDP would be digitalization-related by 2023 as the country&#8217;s enterprises step up digitalizing their businesses, global market intelligence firm IDC predicted.</p>
<p>The research firm estimated that by 2025, at least 80 percent of China&#8217;s new corporate applications would use artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
<p>Chief information officers would play bigger roles within companies by planning for innovative development, while there would be rising demand for professionals in ensuring digital security and compliance, IDC said.</p>

<p>China is on fast track for digitalization, while firms should take future-oriented strategies to prepare for related changes, said Kitty Fok, IDC China&#8217;s managing director.</p>
<p>Chinese firms&#8217; spending on digital transformation has expanded over a threshold by accounting for 51 percent of their total information technology (IT) expenditure this year, a previous report by IDC and Chinese IT firm Inspur showed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following China&#8217;s ban of both direct and indirect imports of cattle and relevant products from India due to the country&#8217;s outbreak of infectious lumpy skin disease, Chinese experts urged India to improve the quality of its export products to reduce its trade deficit with China.</p>
<p>If the Chinese border inspection or any other agency finds illegally imported Indian cattle or relevant products, they will destroy the products, read an announcement on the website of the General Administration of Customs on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The new rule will likely deal a blow to India&#8217;s beef exports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although China has banned direct purchases of buffalo meat from India since 2001 following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the South Asian country, India still sells buffalo meat to China via some Southeast Asian countries, said Yang Chun, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s shipments of buffalo meat and offal to the Chinese mainland via Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, slumped 23 percent year-on-year to 14,645 containers in the first 10 months of 2019, Indian news site The Economic Times reported, citing data from the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, if India can improve the quality of its beef exports, it&#8217;s possible for India to directly sell beef to China in the future along with growing market demand,&#8221; Yang told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s beef demand is between 7 million to 8 million tons a year, with the amount of imported beef expected to reach 1.5 million tons this year, up 50 percent year-on-year, she said.</p>
<p>However, India has repeatedly complained about its trade imbalance with China.</p>
<p>To narrow the imbalance, India should think about how to improve the competitiveness of its industries, companies and products, Dai Yonghong, a professor of the Institute of South Asia Studies at Sichuan University, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;If India can produce high-quality products at good prices, why wouldn&#8217;t Chinese like them? Why wouldn&#8217;t Indian exports increase?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Bilateral trade between China and India was on the rise in 2018. China exported $76.71 billion worth of goods to India, up 12.7 percent year-on-year, while imports from India stood at $18.83 billion, up 15.2 percent year-on-year, data from the Chinese<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> showed.</p>
<p>With a total population of about 2.7 billion, the two rapidly growing Asian countries have great potential in trade and economic cooperation, Dai said, noting that &#8220;India shouldn&#8217;t rely solely on China to solve the trade imbalance problem; rather it should step up efforts to reform its own industries.&#8221;</p>

<p>China-Japan economic and technology cooperation will focus more on global issues, including environmental protection and elderly care, according to an international cooperation agency.</p>
<p>At a seminar focusing on the 40 years of China-Japan economic and technology cooperation in Beijing on Wednesday, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), a governmental agency that coordinates Official Development Assistance (ODA) from the Japanese government, spoke with Chinese and Japanese experts on the possibilities of future cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>The JICA has been providing China with financial and technical support for 40 years, since 1979. According to a report released by the JICA on Wednesday, Japan provided 139.8 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in free aid to China from 1979 to 2018, 3,316.5 billion yen in paid aid, and 185.3 billion yen for technical cooperation.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made an announcement during his visit to China in October 2018, ending the launches of new ODA projects.</p>
<p>Projects which had already started are continuing, but all projects will be completed by March 2022, according to the JICA.</p>
<p>With the end of new ODA to China, the two countries will be able to carry out cultural exchanges and dialogue in the field of development and discuss relevant solutions for global issues, according to the latest report on the JICA&#8217;s business in China, which was released at the seminar.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this new era, Japan and China should commence new and equal cooperation,&#8221; Fujiya Koji, director general of the JICA&#8217;s East and Central Asia and the Caucasus Department, told the Global Times on Wednesday. He added that areas such as environmental protection, aging populations, people-to-people connections, business law and corporate law would be included in the cooperation.</p>
<p>Experts at the seminar said that there is a possibility for broader cooperation between the two sides and that both sides are looking into this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently, China has wanted to learn from past experience in foreign aid, and Japan has that experience. A delegation&nbsp;from the&nbsp;China International Development Cooperation Agency will visit Japan next week to discuss cooperation with us further,&#8221; Fujiya said.</p>
<p>Cai Liang, research fellow at the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies under the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Wednesday that ODA is based on aid, and it promotes investment and trade between China and Japan.</p>
<p>&#8220;China-Japan cooperation with the countries along the BRI has also begun to unfold, which is a new highlight of China-Japan cooperation and also a potential space for development,&#8221; Cai said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Yang Hongchang wraps a snake on him. </p>
<p>Snakes can bite. Snakes can kill. But snakes can be friends with human too. This friendship is part of the economic and cultural fabric of Zisiqiao, a tiny village in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, which has been telling a story of &#8220;Farmers and Snakes&#8221; for four decades. People in Zisiqiao insist that &#8220;all parts of a snake are treasures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zisiqiao is nicknamed as China&#8217;s &#8220;No.1 Snake Village&#8221; with celebrity resident Yang Hongchang dubbed China&#8217;s &#8220;snake king.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Slither of hope</p>
<p></strong>This story dates back to the 1970s when the then 18-year-old Yang ­Hongchang contracted a spinal mobility disease that cost all his family&#8217;s limited wealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The disease broke his body and medical treatment Yang sought had failed to control his ailing condition. A traditional Chinese medicine doctor in Shanghai suggested that Yang try snake liquor as there were snakes in the mountainous area of Deqing where Zisiqiao is located.</p>
<p>Yang caught snakes to make snake liquor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazingly, the spinal infection was finally under control without worsening further,&#8221; Yang told the Global Times. &#8220;Inspired by my own experience, I think snakes can also help cure disease for other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He soon started selling snake liquor and snake pills to earn some money.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wild snakes couldn&#8217;t meet the ever increasing market demand when China began its reform and open-up. In traditional Chinese medicine, snakes are recognized for the medicinal properties and are commonly prepared in nutrition soup or drunk as liquor to boost people&#8217;s immune system. It occurred to me that I could domesticate snakes,&#8221; said Yang, who became the first snake farmer in the village.</p>
<p>Yang believed the medical attributes of venom, gall bladder, liver and skin from snakes would make him a fortune, but the road to the throne as the&#8221;snake king in China&#8221; was not a smooth path of slithering.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first year of 1982, just 10 percent of the snake eggs I purchased hatched, which caused a net loss of more than 10,000 yuan ($1,428).&#8221; Yang didn&#8217;t give up and was determined to keep doing what worked but learn from his mistakes.</p>
<p>Yang improved the incubators for the snake eggs and provided intricate care throughout the hatching period. The next year, the incubating rate reached 80 percent. Yang bred more than 30,000 snakes successfully and sold them to pharmaceutical companies for quite good prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine! That was in 1983. I earned more than 140,000 yuan by raising snakes,&#8221; Yang recalled, feeling as if he had struck gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusted for inflation, that 10,000 yuan is equal to one million today&#8217;s yuan. Inspired by Yang&#8217;s success in the 1980s, the whole village jumped into the snake-raising wave without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Pythons, vipers and cobras are everywhere in the tiny village, which breeds 3 million snakes a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Snakes wrapped around tree branches Photos: Yang Hui/GT</p>
<p><strong>Economies of snake&#8217;s scale</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Fan, an official with Xinshi town told the Global Times that 90 percent of the current 182 households in Zisiqiao breed snakes as their main income source. With 1.5 million snakes incubated annually, the village has yielded revenue of 30 million yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snake-related industries are also booming in the village. Yang innovated processing facilities,invested in new technology and expanded new markets to compete with rival snake farmers all over China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy to grab market share as competition was fierce since there were hundreds of snake villages in China about 20 years ago. Some farmers raised snake to provide meat to restaurants, the others targeted its medical function as we did. Luckily we focused on the medical side, which helped us become the real number one &#8216;snake village&#8217; after 2003 when the SARS broke out in China. Thereafter, people didn&#8217;t dare consume snake. Many snake farmers stopped raising snakes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Villagers like Yang Xiubang and Yang Hongnian have followed &#8220;king of snake&#8221; ever since. Xiubang, 54, told the Global Times that he can now earn more than 500,000 yuan a year. Back 25 years ago, he could only earn 30,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yang Hongnian, 70, and his wife have extracted about 30 bottles of snake venom this year. The 500-gram bottle venom can be sold at 8,500 yuan. The couple also sells dry snakes and other snake organs to pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;My snake products are exported to foreign countries. The skins go to France and Italy for luxury brand bags. The livers and gall bladders go to Japan and South Korea,&#8221; said Xiubang, adding that &#8220;I love snakes; they bring me fortune and change our life. Every part of a snake is treasure, from inside to outside, from head to tail.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bottleneck and prospects</p>
<p></strong>Villagers like Xiubang expressed pity that they can only provide raw materials which means they were still at the bottom end of the industrial chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xiubang&#8217;s concern was echoed by college-educated, younger generation snake farmers such as 32-year-old Yang Xiaoxia.</p>
<p>Xiaoxia and her husband chose the snake farming route after they graduated from Zhejiang Chinese Medical University. She first went to work as a technique supporter for a South Korean biomedical company, a joint venture between Yang Hongchang and his Korean partners. Xiaoxia holds many more will come to believe the medical value of snakes, from Asia to Europe, and even in the Americas.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more profitable to provide materials to foreign clients than the domestic ones. At the same time it&#8217;s much stricter to do export business as the quality criteria are very high. A large part of our products couldn&#8217;t meet the requirements. But we still would target exports more,&#8221; Xiaoxia told the Global Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xiaoxia and her husband hoped that they could move forward with turning their snake raw materials into more complex medicine, with more technology and academic support from research institutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zisiqiao government supported Yang Hongchang and recommended his company becoming a provincial technological, and agricultural enterprise in Zhejiang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has shifted business from simple raw material processing to health-oriented biomedical research and development. The products from his company have upgraded from the traditional snake oil cream, snake pills, snake liquor, snake liver, snake gall bladder to peptide concept medicine and cosmetics.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, our traditional Chinese medicine will also go abroad, I hope that all Chinese snake farmers can make contribution to the health of human beings in the world,&#8221; he hoped.</p>

<p>The China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI) has been great for business and helped improve the business environment, head of Uruguay&#8217;s largest dairy cooperative has said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are convinced that the Belt and Road Initiative has been very positive, because it has created a spectacular climate&#8221; for doing business, said Jose Noel Alpuin, director general of Uruguay&#8217;s national milk producers cooperative (Conaprole), on the sidelines of the 13th China-Latin America and the Caribbean Business Summit, a three-day event which opened in Panama City on Monday.</p>
<p>Since 2018, when Uruguay officially joined the innovative scheme of the BRI designed to spur global growth through stepped-up trade, major Chinese corporations have shown greater confidence in Uruguayan exports, Alpuin told Xinhua.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have received sizable Chinese companies that are interested in continuing to make progress in agreements, and everything indicates that we are going to multiply our exports,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Alpuin pointed out that after Uruguay and China signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly promote the development of the BRI last year, Uruguay&#8217;s exports of powdered milk and cheese to China increased by 60 percent.</p>
<p>Conaprole estimates its exports to China in 2020 would grow between 30 and 40 percent, and the figure could be higher still if Uruguay and its fellow South American members of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) trade bloc reach a free trade agreement with China, Alpuin said.</p>
<p>According to the industry insider, there is a kind of &#8220;consensus&#8221; among Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, three of the four full members of Mercosur, about the benefits of a trade deal between China and Mercosur.</p>
<p>Argentina, another full member, has yet to express its position as a new government took office on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been political changes, and what we are hoping is that these changes move towards a free trade treaty with China, which is our basic objective,&#8221; said Alpuin.</p>
<p>For Uruguay, Alpuin said, it would be &#8220;extremely important&#8221; to improve trade ties with China, one of the world&#8217;s largest importers.</p>
<p>To bolster those ties within the BRI framework, Uruguay&#8217;s 19 departments, or states, have established accords with different local governments in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the best is yet to come, because we are just reaching a high level of trust, especially regarding quality,&#8221; said the head of Conaprole, which was founded in 1936 and today gathers some 2,000 dairy producers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Belt and Road Initiative has been very positive for generating trust between business owners and then for doing business,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s direct investment in Egypt in the first three quarters of 2019 rose by 66 percent to 74.9 million U.S. dollars, a senior Chinese diplomat told a press conference on Tuesday at Egypt&#8217;s under-construction new administrative capital city, east of Cairo.</p>
<p>Han Bing, minister counselor for commercial affairs of the Chinese Embassy in Egypt, said these Chinese investments cover several fields including domestic electric appliances, motorbike manufacturing, agriculture and others.</p>
<p>He added that among those Chinese investors in Egypt are Dayun Motorcycle, Konka, New Hope Group and Angel Yeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile some Chinese enterprises specialized in steel, medicine, textile, new energy, garbage collection, and sewage treatment are interested in the Egyptian market and related projects under discussion,&#8221; Han told reporters.</p>
<p>The Chinese diplomat praised the &#8220;great effort&#8221; made by the Egyptian government to improve Egypt&#8217;s business environment for foreign investors through issuing a series of new investment-magnet policies.</p>
<p>Trade between China and Egypt slightly declined in the first 10 months of 2019 to 10.58 billion dollars, mostly represented in Chinese exports to Egypt.</p>
<p>&#8220;China remains Egypt&#8217;s first trade partner,&#8221; Han noted.</p>
<p>Egypt&#8217;s exports to China include agricultural crops such as oranges, grapes and sugar beets, he said, adding Egypt is the top orange exporter to China with a market share of more than 40 percent.</p>
<p>Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA), a Chinese industrial developer, is currently developing an area of 7.23 square km in Egypt&#8217;s vital Suez Canal economic zone. It has completed the first phase of about 1.25 square km and is working on the second phase of some six square km in Ain Sokhna district of Suez Province, east of the capital Cairo.</p>
<p>&#8220;TEDA zone has altogether 84 enterprises including 42 manufacturing companies, and has attracted more than 1-billion-dollar investment,&#8221; Han pointed out.</p>
<p>The Chinese diplomat also referred to growing cooperation between China and Egypt under the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative that seeks common development for participating states through win-win partnerships.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Yuan Longping (2nd R) , the &#8220;father of hybrid rice&#8221;, inspects a demonstration field with other experts at Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center in Changsha, capital of Hunan Province, Oct. 22, 2019. The third-generation hybrid rice developed by Yuan Longping, the &#8220;father of hybrid rice,&#8221; and his team underwent its first public yield monitoring from Monday to Tuesday and achieved high output. The final yield of the tested variety, G3-1S/P19, came to 1,046.3 kg per mu (about 667 square meters), based on two plots of land in Qingzhu Village under the city of Hengyang in Hunan. (Xinhua/Chen Zeguo)</p>
<p>As the world pioneer in hybrid rice technology, China has helped the Republic of Madagascar grow the grain for 13 years with remarkable results &#8211; yields have tripled in the African country, the head of a leading Chinese hybrid rice firm in Madagascar told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though Madagascar has a 400-year history of growing rice, yields were less than 2.5 tons per hectare in the past. But they soared to 7.5 tons per hectare under instruction of Chinese agricultural experts and companies, Zhang Lijun, manager of the Madagascar agricultural industrial park of Hunan Province-based Yuan Longping High-Tech Agriculture Co, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese agronomist Yuan Longping, known for developing the first hybrid rice strains, is praised as the &#8220;father of hybrid rice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The highest yield of the hybrid rice could reach 10.8 tons per hectare in Madagascar,&#8221; he noted, adding that hybrid rice seeds and sowing methods from China made this happen on 20,000 hectares of rice paddies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our sowing method of hybrid rice doesn&#8217;t require transplanting as the Madagascar farmers used to do. One farmer could only transplant rice seedlings on less than 0.1 hectares per day, but now the farmer could seed 0.2 to 0.3 hectares per day using our method,&#8221; Zhang said.</p>
<p>He noted that about 20 Chinese experts and staff now work in the agricultural industrial park.</p>
<p>Chinese hybrid rice technology helped local farmers increase their incomes by $300 &#8211; $400 per hectare per year, according to Zhang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Madagascar has become the country with the largest planting area and the highest yield of hybrid rice in Africa, and the first African country to realize the development of the entire industrial chain of hybrid rice breeding, seed production, planting, processing and sales, China Radio International reported.</p>
<p>On Monday, the China National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center and Guangdong Province-based property company Country Garden&#8217;s agriculture division signed a cooperation deal with Madagascar&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/20.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Agriculture</a>, Livestock and Fisheries, to help the African country realize rice self-sufficiency by 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2018, China-Africa trade in farm products increased from $650 million to $6.92 billion, with an average annual growth rate of 14 percent, said Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Changfu.</p>
<p>By the end of 2018, Chinese enterprises had invested more than 15 billion yuan ($2.13 billion) in Africa, with 115 agricultural projects worth more than 5 million yuan, covering more than two-thirds of African countries, according to the ministry.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is willing to share its experience and practices in food production and vows to support Africa in achieving food security by 2030,&#8221; said Han.</p>
<p>In the next three years, China will hold training courses to train another 10,000 agricultural experts in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value of agricultural trade between China and Africa is expected to exceed $10 billion within 10 years, chinanews.com reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Chinese companies will invest $50 million to build an agricultural industrial park in Madagascar, with an annual production of 4,000 tons of hybrid rice, the report said.</p>

<p>In the Year of the Pig, China&#8217;s traditional hog farming industry is undergoing tremendous changes as both big and small farms revamp themselves to combat one of the world&#8217;s worst animal diseases.</p>
<p>Hit by outbreaks of African swine fever, China&#8217;s pig herd shrank by some 40 percent year-on-year in recent months, causing pork prices to increase and pushing authorities to take measures to stabilize supply.</p>
<p>While the disease has posed challenges to farmers, it also accelerated the shift of China&#8217;s hog production from backyard pigpens to large-scale, standardized farms with better biosecurity measures and environmental treatment facilities, analysts said.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling up</strong></p>
<p>While cyclical fluctuations of pork supply and prices are a worldwide phenomenon, such volatilities are especially high in China, partly because the majority of the country&#8217;s pigs are produced on family farms.</p>
<p>Last year, the country&#8217;s top 10 listed companies with pig farming businesses produced less than 7 percent of the country&#8217;s hogs for slaughter, data from a research institute under property developer Evergrande showed.</p>
<p>The lack of standardized scale farming not only drags down productivity but also increases market volatility, as small-scale farms often lack the technology and facilities to control diseases, according to Zhu Zengyong, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).</p>
<p>The government has been stepping up efforts to scale the sector up, with the State Council releasing guidelines in September that aim to raise the ratio of hogs produced by scale farms to 58 percent by 2022 and 65 percent by 2025 from roughly 49 percent in 2018.</p>
<p>In an action plan to restore hog production released Friday, the country vowed to add 120 pilot hog farms with standardized operations in the next three years, which could serve as examples to boost industry standardization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large-scale farms can provide stable supply across cycles, reducing price volatilities,&#8221; said Qin Jun, vice general manager of Henan-based Muyuan Foods Co, one of the country&#8217;s largest hog producers.</p>
<p>Thanks to soaring pork prices, Muyuan reported an almost 300 percent year-on-year surge in net profit in the first three quarters.</p>
<p>The fat margin will allow the company to upgrade its facilities and invest in cutting-edge technologies, Qin said, adding that the company has invited programers and algorithm and mechanical engineers to join its research team to cut labor costs and better control diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the disease is a big challenge to the pig farming sector, it also leads to opportunities for corporate champions to build new production capacity and increase their competitiveness,&#8221; Qin said.</p>
<p><strong>Going green</strong></p>
<p>Raising pigs in an environmentally friendly way has been a thorny problem, but farmers and firms are scrambling to embrace this new trend as the government has stepped up efforts to make the industry greener.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recycle swine waste by turning swine waste into fertilizer,&#8221; said Wang Shijie, chairman of Henan Kanglong Industrial Group, an agricultural firm.</p>
<p>On a piece of land as big as 10 soccer fields, the firm can raise 2,000 pigs per year while growing crops. After it is processed, swine waste can satisfy the fertilizing demand of that land, said Wang, adding that this method can effectively utilize waste, achieve zero emissions and boost soil fertility.</p>
<p>The pro-environment approach reflects a new trend of pig farming promoted by the government. In 2016, China issued a five-year plan to steer its hog production. The plan called for efforts to accelerate the green development of pig farming in a bid to expand its overall hog production capacity and build up its international competitiveness.</p>
<p>The new action plan released Friday also vowed policy support for waste utilization, aiming for a comprehensive animal waste utilization rate of over 75 percent by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>To meet the higher green standards, pig farmers and firms are also turning to technologies. Chang Xianyun, a pig farmer who has 1,900 pigs in stock, believes that her heavy investment in waste treatment equipment is the right strategy.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old spent 500,000 yuan ($70,000) on upgrading her facilities, with the bulk of the money used on a wastewater treatment system. Chang said that no wastewater would be discharged from the farm if the new system is used.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the money is worth it because this is good for the farm, the environment and the people in the village,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Keeping farms clean is the key to raising healthy hogs, and using waste treatment facilities can reduce viruses and also strengthen disease prevention and control, said Wang Zuli, another researcher with the CAAS.</p>
<p>Industry giants have fat wallets to fare better. According to Qin, Muyuan spends some 10 million yuan on environmental protection facilities in every farm with 100,000 pigs, and installs a central ventilation system in every pigpen for disinfection and deodorization.</p>
<p>The improvement in the living environment of pigs also helped the company counter African swine fever, Qin said, adding that the company has so far managed to keep the impacts of the disease on its costs under control.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Visitors view a car from German carmaker BMW at Haikou New Energy Vehicle Exhibition in Haikou, south China&#8217;s Hainan Province, Jan. 10, 2019. A total of 197 new energy vehicles were displayed at the exhibition. (Xinhua/Yang Guanyu)</p>
<p>Sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) in China declined 43.7 percent year-on-year in November, contracting for a fifth month in a row, data from the country&#8217;s auto industry association showed on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From January to November, the production of NEVs was 1.09 million, a year-on-year increase of 3.6 percent, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Tuesday. During the same period, sales totaled 1.04 million, up 1.2 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CAAM forecast a contraction for the whole year.</p>
<p>The sharp decline in November and the lower forecast mainly reflect a government decision to cut subsidies for green cars, which hampered consumers&#8217; purchases, said an analyst, noting that 2020 will be a difficult year &#8211; and a turning point for China&#8217;s vast NEV market, the world&#8217;s largest.</p>
<p>China is expected to remove subsidies for the NEV sector in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previously, the domestic NEV market was booming but chaotic as many low-end NEVs were tailored to qualify for subsidies instead of market demand, and that era was bound to end,&#8221; Zeng Zhiling, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy LMC Automotive, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The sector will be more market-driven as government subsidies end, Zeng said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the subsidies encouraged the front-loading of consumption, especially in less-developed areas &#8211; another cause of the sharp drop, Zeng said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s NEV sector expanded robustly over the past years, with sales surging to more than 1.26 million units in 2018 from less than 10,000 in 2009. NEV sales jumped almost 62 percent last year even as the broader auto market contracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government will shift its policy in the sector from &#8216;stimulating&#8217; to &#8216;regulating&#8217; next year,&#8221; Zeng said.</p>
<p>Analysts said that despite the looming pain of a transition next year, NEV makers should be confident that government support for the sector is firm as always.</p>
<p>The<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/6.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a> released a draft plan for the domestic NEV industry on December 3, vowing to make pure electric cars a mainstream in the vehicle market. The ministry also set a target of having NEVs make up 20 percent of the country&#8217;s total sales by 2025.</p>
<p>The market has also attracted foreign players like Tesla and Volkswagen, which increased their bets in the world&#8217;s largest NEV over the past year</p>
<p>&#8220;They will further enrich customers&#8217; choices and increase competition for domestic players, that&#8217;s how the market should be,&#8221; Zeng said.</p>
<p>In November, total auto sales in China fell 3.6 percent year-on-year, a slight rebound from drops of 4 percent in October and 5.2 percent in September.</p>
