<p>China showcased its JL-2 nuclear-capable submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) for the first time during the National Day parade in Beijing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The JL-2 is a mature SLBM, and is actually the submarine-launched type of DF-31, and the next generation JL-3 is undergoing research and development, a Chinese missile expert said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twelve JL-2 missiles were carried by trucks and reviewed at Tiananmen Square along with the other advanced weapons and equipment of China in active service.</p>
<p>Yang Chengjun, a Chinese expert on missile technology and nuclear strategy and chief scientist of quantum defense, told the Global Times that the JL-2 is a submarine-launched version of the DF-31, an advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and it&#8217;s a very mature missile already deployed in the People&#8217;s Liberation Army Navy.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Type 094 nuclear-powered submarine is able to carry JL-2 missiles, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>Equipped with the missiles, the Type 094 submarines represent China&#8217;s first credible, sea-based nuclear deterrent, the US Department of Defense said in a report released in August 2018.</p>
<p>China has reportedly started the development of a third generation SLBM, the JL-3.</p>
<p>An unidentified flying object was seen across several provinces in China in June, which led military analysts to believe it was a test launch of the JL-3, as it coincided with a scheduled military test in the Bohai Sea and Bohai Straits.</p>
<p>When asked about the reported test, China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/2.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of National Defense</a> said it was &#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;not targeted at any country or objective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yang said that the JL-3 is actually the submarine-launched version of the DF-41, the most advanced ICBM, which also made its debut at the parade, and is undergoing research and development.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s domestically made utility helicopter, the Z-20, made its debut at the&nbsp; National Day parade on Tuesday, a move that confirmed its active service status within the Chinese military.</p>
<p>All equipment on display in the parade is domestically made and in service, Major General Cai Zhijun, deputy head of the office of the leading group for the military parade, said at a press conference in August.</p>
<p>This means that the Z-20 has already entered active service with the Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) following a lengthy trial phase.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/2.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of National Defense</a> confirmed the development of the Z-20 in December 2013 after the chopper&#8217;s alleged first test flight was spotted in northeastern China. Many pictures of the Z-20 have surfaced on the internet and Chinese aerospace magazines since then.</p>
<p>The Z-20 is a medium-lift utility helicopter that can adapt to different terrains and weather, and is expected to be used by the army and navy, military experts told the Global Times previously, noting that it can also operate on plateau areas like in Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region, where high elevations could cause problems, including a lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>As a utility helicopter it can be used in many types of missions, including personnel and cargo transport, search and rescue, reconnaissance and anti-submarine, experts said, noting that no other Chinese helicopter is as versatile as the Z-20.</p>

<p>The Gongji-11 (GJ-11) stealth attack drone, capable of attacking strategic targets without being detected, was showcased at Tuesday&#8217;s National Day parade, indicating it is in active Chinese military service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boasting a flying wing aerodynamic design similar to the US B-2 strategic bomber, the GJ-11 was displayed at the parade in Beijing for the first time.</p>
<p>All weapons on display at the parade are in active service, said Major General Tan Min, Executive Deputy Director of the Military Parade Joint Command Office, at a press conference last week prior to the parade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drone is believed to have strong stealth capability, enabling it to sneak deep into enemy territory and launch strikes with weapons hidden in its weapons bay on key hostile targets, military analysts said.</p>
<p>Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, told the Global Times that China has mastered technologies used on the drone.</p>
<p>Judging from the drone&#8217;s aerodynamic design, Wei said it is likely to have outstanding stealth capabilities and flying qualities.</p>
<p>Military observers speculated that the GJ-11 is the final version of the Lijian, or Sharp Sword, stealth drone that made its first test flight in 2013 due to similarities.</p>
<p>Russia is also developing the S-70 Okhotnik, a similar flying wing stealth attack drone, while the US has made the likes of X-47B stealth drones.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />China’s latest bomber, the H-6N with refueling capability, made its debut at the National Day parade in Beijing on Tuesday, and Chinese military analysts said that the new bomber’s ability to take aerial refueling can give it a much longer operational range compared to its predecessor H-6K.</p>
<p>Three H-6N bombers flew above Tiananmen Square during the parade.</p>
<p>The new H-6N with refueling capability is believed to be the latest entry to the H-6 bomber family, with many improvements made to its predecessor H-6K, including an in-flight fuel-receiving probe on the nose of the aircraft, military observers said.</p>
<p>This probe will allow the H-6N with refueling capability to conduct aerial refueling, significantly extending its operational range and expanding weapons load, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The H-6N with refueling capability is capable of launching more powerful missiles, Yang Chengjun, a Chinese missile expert and quantum defense scientist, told the Global Times.</p>

<p>Excelling at combat in a variety of terrains including high-elevation plateaus, forests and wetland, China&#8217;s latest tank, the Type 15, rolled past Tiananmen Square in its first debut to the general public on Tuesday during the National Day parade.</p>
<p>The lightweight tank is listed in China&#8217;s July defense white paper as one of the country&#8217;s most advanced weapons.</p>
<p>The Type 15 tank is significantly lighter than the Type 99 and Type 96, the two main battle tanks in service of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA), military experts told the Global Times previously, noting that this enables the Type 15 to operate effectively in difficult terrain that may be inaccessible to heavier tanks.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, its main gun is likely capable of firing armor-piercing rounds and gun-launched missiles, giving the tank enough firepower for its designed missions, experts said, noting that its mobility also means it is less likely to be detected and destroyed.</p>
<p>The Type 15 is also expected to be equipped with many electronic devices, enabling it to send, receive and share real-time information from an entire combat system, greatly expanding its combat capability, analysts said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/2.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of National Defense</a> confirmed the commissioning of the Type 15 in the PLA at a routine press conference in December 2018 after the country first unveiled a model at the National Museum of China in November.</p>

<p>China showcased the new DF-17, a ballistic missile said to be hypersonic with a very high defense penetration capability, for the first time at the National Day parade on Tuesday, with Chinese military expert saying that it is almost impossible to be intercepted by enemies.</p>
<p>DF-17 conventional ballistic missiles were displayed at the event in Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>The DF-17 is a very recently developed type of short to medium-range missile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will play a vital role in safeguarding China&#8217;s territorial integrity, as regions including the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and Northeast Asia are all within its striking range, Yang Chengjun, a Chinese missile expert and quantum defense scientist, told the Global Times, noting that South Korea has been deploying the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1012594.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THAAD</a> air defense system and Japan is fielding SM-3 interceptor missiles, which are security threats to China.</p>
<p>The DF-17 missile features a hypersonic glide vehicle as its warhead, which can travel at 10 times the speed of sound, UK-based media outlet Daily Mail reported in June.</p>
<p>The very high speed leaves enemies with little time to react, military observers noted.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional ballistic missiles, the DF-17 can change its trajectory in mid-flight, giving enemies a minimal chance of intercepting it, Yang said.</p>
<p>If hostile air defense systems like THAAD, SM-3 and Patriot get the chance to capture the DF-17&#8217;s launch and prepare for its arrival in advance, there is some possibility of interception, but this rarely happens since a launch in actual combat will be done secretly, Yang said.</p>
<p>Other countries have also been developing hypersonic weapons, like the US AGM-183A and Russian Avangard missiles.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the DF-41, made its debut at the National Day parade in Beijing on Tuesday, which Chinese military experts said is a message to the world that China has sufficient and reliable strategic nuclear power to respond to any &#8220;nuclear blackmail&#8221; from any country.</p>
<p>16&nbsp;transporter erector launchers of the DF-41 missile were inspected during the parade in Tiananmen Square on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A DF-41 missile has an operational range of more than 14, 000 kilometers and can carry about 10 independently targetable nuclear warheads, capable of hitting anywhere on Earth, according to the US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, and this would make DF-41 the world&#8217;s longest range missile, surpassing the range of the US LGM-30 Minuteman which has a reported range of 13,000 kilometers.</p>
<p>Yang Chengjun, a Chinese expert on missile technology and nuclear strategy and chief scientist of quantum defense, told the Global Times that the DF-41 is Chinese fourth-generation strategic nuclear weapon and has the longest operational range among all Chinese ICBMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This ICBM&#8217;s research and development was very successful, and its technology is very mature. During testing, there was no failure record,&#8221; Yang noted.</p>
<p>Wu Jian, editor of Defense Weekly under the Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News, told the Global Times that the multiple transporter erector launchers of the DF-41 missile shown in the parade proved that the People&#8217;s Liberation Army has already built a massive and advanced system to support the use of this missile. &#8220;This proves that China has sufficient and reliable strategic nuclear power, and decision-makers have the confidence to show and use them to respond to any kind of nuclear threat from any country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter how advanced the missile is, it always needs a mature and comprehensive system to make sure it can accurately strike a target, which at least includes intelligence gathering, satellite surveillance, logistics, and construction of launching positions,&#8221; Wu noted.</p>
