<p>The Alpine Ski Orienteering Open will return for the new season next month, organizers said, with the event growing from three races last season to five this season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beidahu, the 2007 Asian Winter Games venue in Northeast China&#8217;s Jilin Province, will host the season opener of the competition for amateur skiers on December 21, and the tournament will travel to Yabuli in Heilongjiang Province on January 11.</p>
<p>The event will travel to Finland for the first time in January after the Yabuli race, as part of the Year of Winter Sports celebrated between China and Finland.</p>
<p>After the Finland race, Aoshan in Northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province will host the race, before the season finale in Zhangjiakou, North China&#8217;s Hebei Province, where some of the skiing races of the 2022 Winter Olympics will be held.</p>
<p>Alpine ski orienteering originated from an intra-club competition between members of a Beijing-based ski club in 2013. It features teams of three racers who use either skis or snowboards to race down different types of slopes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are required to check in at every checkpoint on the slopes, and then take a cable car up the mountain again to race down a different slope and stop at checkpoints. Some of the checkpoints are not easy to find and racers may miss them on the way down and have to redo the run.</p>
<p>Participants for the new season are expected to average around 3,000, organizers said, as last year&#8217;s season finale received more than 20,000 applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has vowed to have 300 million Chinese people take up winter sports by 2022 when Beijing hosts the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Li Chungang, general manager of Sportvane, the company that organizes the event, said the tournament is in talks with countries including Japan and Canada on &#8220;exporting&#8221; the sport there.</p>
