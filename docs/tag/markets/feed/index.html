<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The China Foreign Exchange Trade System building in Shanghai on August 24. Photo: VCG</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Foreign investors have been reinforcing their purchasing power on Chinese bonds, official data showed, with analysts giving credit to the reform and opening-up in China&#8217;s bonds market, and better interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign investors jumped at Chinese bonds in the first 11 months of the year, with cumulative net purchases reaching 970.2 billion yuan ($137.85 billion), data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) showed on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, transactions by foreign investors came to a total of 567 billion yuan, up 5 percent month-on-month and 127 percent year-on-year, CFETS said. That meant the total cumulative net purchases from foreign investors approached nearly 1 trillion yuan in the first 11 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>November was the 12th consecutive month that foreign investors overweighed Chinese bond holdings with continuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also notable that the number of foreign investors new to China&#8217;s interbank bond market in the first 11 months &#8211; 1,331 &#8211; has surpassed the total number in previous years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reforms and opening-up in China&#8217;s bond market have enabled more foreign investors to enter China&#8217;s financial market, as reflected by the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Shanghai-London Stock Connect and the country&#8217;s great efforts to build its offshore financial market, Liu Xuezhi, a senior economist at the Bank of Communications, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the risk of investing overseas is increasing with a declining yield rate under the pressure of the global economic downturn … but China&#8217;s bonds have relatively good returns on investment,&#8221; Liu noted, adding that foreigners&#8217; increasing purchasing power shows their confidence in China&#8217;s economy and financial development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2019 marks the lowest-performing year for global bond yields, but the interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds have surged to an historical peak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 10-year bond spreads between China and the US have surpassed 140 basis points, which is relatively high in history, Reuters said in August.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Gree&#8217;s stock price closed high on Monday morning at 59.96 yuan ($8.65), after Gree said it will be without a controlling shareholder as the private equity firm Hillhouse Capital becomes the biggest shareholder of Gree Electric on Monday. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Hillhouse Capital will take over 15 percent of Gree&#8217;s shares at a price of 41.6 billion yuan ($5.9 billion).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">As Hillhouse Capital takes over Gree&#8217;s shares, the company is now without an actual controlling shareholder and left with a new management system, which is deemed as a modern shareholding system. Numerous companies are under such a system, including Pingan and TCL, according to a report by yicai.com </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Market participants generally believe that with such a large quantity of investment, the cash flow will lead to higher dividend requirements from major shareholders. It is expected that Gree&#8217;s dividend rate will increase in the future, the report said. </span></p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Graphics: GT</p>
<p>China&#8217;s economy, second-ranked globally in nominal GDP terms and the largest based on an adjustment of GDP for purchasing power parity (PPP), will remain among the best performers in the global economic landscape in the upcoming year, China market watchers said.</p>
<p>Whether the economy can maintain 6 percent growth or not, it&#8217;s poised to retain its leading position and continue to serve as the locomotive of the global economy, they noted.</p>
<p>Green shoots of recovery are expected to be seen in both domestic and overseas markets in 2020, Guo Xiaobei, a researcher with China Minsheng Bank, told the Global Times, estimating the Chinese economy will post full-year expansion of around 6 percent in the next year.</p>
<p>Guo cited China&#8217;s implementation of various reform measures such as the ramped-up opening of the economy at an accelerated pace, monetary easing by major economies, hopes for a thaw in China-US trade tensions, and the UK&#8217;s effort to block a no-deal<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a>.</p>
<p>That suggests China will continue to power up the global economy, and the feat won&#8217;t be challenged by the possible scenario of growth falling below 6 percent, analysts said.</p>
<p>According to data from the World Bank, China&#8217;s GDP in current US-dollar terms totaled $13.61 trillion in 2018, second only to the US with $20.49 trillion. Japan held the third spot with $4.97 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going by GDP in PPP terms, China was already the largest economy with $25.36 trillion last year, followed by the US with $20.49 trillion and India with $10.50 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nation also excelled as measured by annualized growth rates. India was the fastest-growing major economy with 6.98 percent expansion in 2018, ahead of China with 6.6 percent growth. The US economy was in third place with 2.86 percent growth, according to World Bank statistics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With US growth expected to moderate in 2020 and India still struggling to recover from the shock of its economy slumping to a more-than-six-year low of 4.5 percent in the July-September period from 7 percent a year earlier, the estimates that China will remain the power of the global economy seem to hold up well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has topped the global rankings of contributions to global economic growth since 2006, according to a report released in August by the National Bureau of Statistics.</p>

<p>Though China has witnessed slow economic growth amid the China-US trade war, it has stabilized its job market thanks to the country&#8217;s tertiary industries, which have created more positions during the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading efforts.</p>
<p>The country&#8217; s steady employment situation refutes claims by US President Donald Trump that China had lost 3 million jobs due to the trade war. Experts gave credit to the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading and the appearance of new forms of flexible employment, saying the stable job market shows the resilience of China&#8217;s economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies in tertiary sectors told the Global Times that they had created millions of new job opportunities over recent years, and they have great demand for professional talent in IT, procurement, operations and services to support development in the future.</p>
<p>Industry reports showed that live-streaming, a new industry rising amid the fast development of the country&#8217;s internet sector, has generated a total of 4 million new jobs for the country; the food delivery industry has generated over 20 million job opportunities in both direct and indirect forms &#8211; some of which haven&#8217;t yet been factored into the official National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the downward pressure on the economy, one of the main factors necessary to maintaining the stable job market is the function of tertiary industries as a reservoir of employment,&#8221; said NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong, noting that tertiary industries cover a broad spectrum, with a growing number of enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 55 percent of employed people worked in tertiary industries in China, NBS said on November 20.</p>
<p>More and more Chinese graduates hope to work in tertiary industries, in companies such as those working with cutting-edge technology or the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>23-year-old postgraduate student Zhang Yali is looking for a job in the internet industry in Beijing. Majoring in journalism and communications, she would prefer a product-operations or user-operations position in an internet company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having commenced her job hunt in August, Zhang has applied for eight jobs in large Chinese internet companies such as tech conglomerate Tencent and ride-hailing services provider Didi Chuxing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though Chinese internet companies had mass layoffs at the end of last year, I still want to enter this industry because it is a driving force for economic development and working in this industry will be promising,&#8221; Zhang said. She knows the work will be challenging and require staying up late, but the industry will enable her to catch up with the pace of China&#8217;s economic restructuring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first 10 months of the year, China created 11.93 million new urban jobs across the country, meeting 2019&#8217;s annual target of more than 11 million new urban jobs in advance of the deadline. The unemployment rate in urban areas dropped 0.1 percentage points to 5.1 percent in October, mainly due to the improving employment status of graduates, NBS said.</p>
<p>Li Chang&#8217;an, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said that the improving employment absorption capacity in the services industry had effectively resolved employment difficulties in secondary industries.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></p>
<p><i>All eyes are on the possibility of China&#8217;s GDP growth falling below 6 percent in 2020. What if China&#8217;s GDP growth falls below 6 percent in 2020, as the prolonged China-US trade war and a slowing global economy continue to cast a shadow on the country&#8217;s economic growth? Leading Chinese economists and China market watchers are unfazed by concerns over whether or not the world&#8217;s second-largest economy can hold the psychological 6 percent growth level, showed a new poll from the Global Times released on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roughly half of the respondents of a GT Source poll of 22 leading Chinese economists and China market watchers opted for a greater than 50 percent chance of the economy growing at a pace of below 6 percent in the next year. The other half chose the other side of the China growth coin &#8211; the probability of below-6-percent growth would be less than 50 percent.</p>
<p>Among the poll respondents were Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Digits; Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC; Hong Hao, managing director and head of research at BOCOM International; Zhang Yansheng, chief research fellow with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE); Sheng Songcheng, former head of the statistics and analysis department of the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBC), China&#8217;s central bank; and Yao Yang, dean of the National School of Development of Peking University.</i></p>
<p>China&#8217;s economy faces pressure to maintain 6 percent growth in 2020, but optimism about the economy prevails among leading Chinese economists and China market watchers. They&#8217;re unfazed by concerns over whether the world&#8217;s second-largest economy can hold the key level of support or not, the findings of a new poll from the Global Times showed on Monday.</p>
<p>The survey results indicated that views are about evenly split when it comes to maintaining 6-percent GDP growth or embracing a sub-6 percent growth rate.</p>
<p>The poll included respondents from leading Chinese and foreign banks, government-affiliated think tanks, private research institutes and venture capital firms, giving a valuable look inside the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a high probability that [the economy will grow at a pace] of 6 percent or above,&#8221; Zhang at CCIEE said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chance of the economy slipping below 6 percent would be less than 50 percent, according to Sheng, a former PBC official and currently adjunct professor of economics and finance at the China Europe International Business School. He said that the economy is heading for a rebound next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s economy expanded by 6 percent in the third quarter of 2019, the weakest quarterly figure since 1992 when official records began, official data showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Dong Ximiao, chief analyst at Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute, put it, the Chinese economy has bottomed out, meaning &#8220;there&#8217;s no room left for economic indicators to move further down, and there are already signs of marginal improvements in the economy.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those choosing the other side of the coin, instead of voicing pessimism, have favored a market-oriented growth trajectory that may sometimes fluctuate widely, over an obsession with pushing growth into a 6-percent range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting the odds of falling below 6 percent at 80 percent, Hong at BOCOM International said that the structure of the economy has changed with the services sector contributing massively to economic growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking GDP numbers to heart is reminiscent of the past when Chinese people lived in a planned economy, he told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The planned economy was shown to be dwelling on whether we managed to grow the economy by a certain percentage so as to reach a certain economic size,&#8221; Hong said, noting that such a mindset goes against market orientation as it risks leading to a substantial resource misallocation.</p>
<p>A numerical approach to economic policymaking ought to be abandoned, argued the head of research at BOCOM International, who forecast that sub-6 percent growth would be normal in years to come.</p>
<p>In a research note sent to the Global Times in late November, Goldman Sachs economists led by Andrew Tilton expected China&#8217;s economic growth in 2020 to be marginally lower at 5.8 percent compared with 6.1 percent estimated for the whole of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang Tao, chief China economist of UBS, predicted in a note sent to the Global Times in mid-November that China&#8217;s GDP growth would stabilize at 5.7 percent in 2020 and 5.6 percent in 2021.</p>
<p>Jing Linbo, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Evaluation Studies, one of the poll respondents voting for a greater than 50 percent chance, said &#8220;it&#8217;s already quite difficult for China&#8217;s economy, of such a gigantic size, to maintain a growth rate of above 6 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the economy shifting toward more balanced growth, a slowdown in GDP expansion is a well-accepted scenario, Jing commented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the words of Hong, slower growth hasn&#8217;t and won&#8217;t become a source of concern.</p>
<p>The nation&#8217;s transition away from a labor-intensive growth model and toward its thriving internet sector has created a multitude of non-traditional jobs such as individual vendors on Taobao that have yet to be included in the official job market survey, he stressed. Every percentage of China&#8217;s GDP growth now creates many more jobs than was the case previously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another sign of the economy&#8217;s resilience, the Chinese mainland equity market has posted an impressive performance for the whole of the year, remarked Hong, also chief strategist at BOCOM International.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shanghai Composite Index finished up 0.13 percent at 2,875.81 points on Monday. The flagship index had risen by 15.31 percent as of Monday since the beginning of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<br />China&#8217;s top securities watchdog has approved the initial public offering (IPO) applications of two companies.</p>
<p>The two companies are China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Group Co., Ltd., and Hubei Heyuan Gas Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Their underwriters will confirm IPO dates and publish their prospectuses following discussions with the stock exchanges, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement.</p>
<p>It did not specify the total amount of funds to be raised.</p>
<p>Under the current IPO system, new shares are subject to approval from the CSRC. China is gradually switching from an approval-based IPO system to one based on registration.</p>

</center>The purchasing managers&#8217; index for China&#8217;s manufacturing sector firmed up to 50.2 in November from 49.3 in October, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Saturday. </p>
<p>A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below reflects contraction. </p>
<p>November&#8217;s figure re-entered the expansion zone, ending month-on-month contraction reported in the previous six months in a row, said NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe. </p>
<p>On a month-on-month basis, the sub-index for production gained 1.8 points to 52.6 in November, signaling faster expansion, while that for new orders rebounded by 1.7 points to 51.3, back in the expansion zone. </p>
<p>Improvements were seen in both the supply side and demand side, with both indices at their highest level since the second half of the year, said Zhao. </p>
<p>Imports and exports were improving in November, said Zhao, as the NBS data showed the sub-index for new export orders gained 1.8 points to 48.8, while the index for imports climbed 2.9 points to 49.8. </p>
<p>Chinese enterprises, in general, reported prosperity rebounds, with the PMI of large enterprises up 1 point from the previous month to 50.9, back in the expansion zone. </p>
<p>In November, PMI of high-tech manufacturing, equipment manufacturing and consumer goods all rose for two consecutive months, showing accelerated transformation and upgrades, said Zhao. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, China&#8217;s non-manufacturing sector registered faster expansion in November with its PMI at 54.4, up from 52.8 in October, NBS data showed. </p>
<p>&#8220;The distinct pick-up in the manufacturing PMI resulted from multiple positive factors,&#8221; said Wen Tao, an analyst with the China Logistics Information Center, noting that domestic market demand potential has been released upon the country&#8217;s counter-cyclical adjustments and tax cuts. </p>
<p>While year-end holiday consumption expectations drove the growth of the consumer goods industry, stable growth of several key industries offered support for the economic operation, said Wen. </p>
<p>Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the Development Research Center of the State Council, said the favorable rebound showed stabilizing signs of the economy, but the foundation needs to be further consolidated. </p>
<p>As the downward pressure remains, efforts should be stepped up in expanding domestic needs and strengthening the stabilization, said Zhang. </p>
<p>Saturday&#8217;s data also showed China&#8217;s composite PMI went up 1.7 points from a month ago to 53.7, indicating faster business expansion.</p>

<p>China vowed on Thursday to further open its markets and lower tariffs while deepening cooperation via the<br />
 <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, in a bid to achieve high-quality trade development by 2022.</p>
<p>A document released by the State Council, China&#8217;s cabinet, stated that the country will continue to widen its market access for foreign capital to invest in emerging high-technology industries and the modern services sector, giving these areas full play to become drivers of China&#8217;s industrial upgrading and the high-quality development of foreign trade.</p>
<p>China will further lower import tariffs and boost imports of agricultural products and services, while enhancing the protection of intellectual property rights by increasing penalties for violations.</p>
<p>The government also encourages the infusion of high technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data and blockchain with trade.</p>
<p>China will further encourage meat imports, allowing the total to potentially exceed 6 million tons this year, Gao Feng, the spokesperson for the<br />
 <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a>, said Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prolonged trade war might have affected some foreign companies&#8217; operations in China, but that is not the main cause,&#8221; Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times Thursday.</p>
<p>The changing manufacturing environment in China as well as the more alluring foreign capital policy in emerging regions such as Southeast Asia have caused shifts by some foreign players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, we should notice that China is continuously attracting foreign capital to flow into advanced technology. The participation benefits both sides as it increases the global cake,&#8221; said Bai.</p>
<p>China urges relevant countries to relax export controls on China, while the country will ramp up efforts to build an export control system to manage trade risks, according to the document.</p>
<p>&#8220;China needs such a system to protect domestic market entities,&#8221; Bai said, adding that a certain country is cracking down on technology exports to China in the name of national security, which is totally against the principle of free trade.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;National security&#8217; has become a US patent, a tool of executing double standards,&#8221; Bai noted.</p>
<p>According to Bai, China should have an &#8220;unreliable entity list&#8221; well in hand no matter what direction the China-US trade talks take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though no specific company&#8217;s name is placed on the list, the mechanism is necessary,&#8221; he stressed.</p>
<p>At Thursday&#8217;s press conference, Gao disclosed no further information about the list.
