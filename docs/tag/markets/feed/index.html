<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The logo of China&#8217;s tech giant Huawei. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>&nbsp;Telefonica Deutschland, a unit of Spain&#8217;s Telefonica, chose China&#8217;s Huawei to build its 5G network in Germany, which experts said is a rational choice based on Germany&#8217;s demand of keeping an edge in the coming 5G era. More companies in the Europe are expected to follow suit instead of caving to the US&#8217; bullying actions,&nbsp;industry analysts&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telefonica disclosing its cooperation with Huawei at such a critical moment indicates the German government has nodded to deploy Huawei 5G networks in the country,&#8221; Xiang Ligang, an expert on the telecommunications industry, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The decision by the company comes amid a heated debate in Germany and also in Europe over whether to include Huawei in the continent&#8217;s critical network infrastructure amid US fear-mongering. Germany has yet to finalize security rules governing equipment suppliers.</p>
<p>For European countries, to choose Huawei or not has become more of a choice between &#8220;the market or caving in to US pressure, which is ridiculous and will tear them apart especially at the critical time of developing the next-generation technology,&#8221; an industry insider surnamed Jiang told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jiang noted that the diverging views in the German market are also a result of German carriers&#8217; interests in the US telecom market, noting that the US is now forcing them to face a tough question of whether to choose Huawei or the US market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;The national dignity of Germany doesn&#8217;t allow the country to blindly follow the US government dictation,&#8221; Xiang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;More carriers are set to follow Telefonica,&#8221; Jiang Junmu, chief writer at telecom industry news website c114.com.cn, told the Global Times on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s other two mobile operators &#8211; market leader Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone &#8211; have yet to publicly confirm whether they will stick with Huawei for 5G.</p>
<p>Although Germany&#8217;s attitude toward Huawei 5G networks is ambiguous, the European country definitely wants to use Huawei, Xiang said, noting that without Huawei, which has an absolute advantage in both quality and price, the cost and time of rolling out of 5G networks in Germany.</p>

<p>December 12 marks the shopping spree of &#8220;Double 12,&#8221; the follow up to last month&#8217;s record-breaking Double 11 festival sequel and one of the most exhilarating shopping welcomed by China&#8217;s e-commerce players.</p>
<p>Akin to the Double 11 festival, over 10 million items are on sale in the upcoming shopping spree. Brands on Tmall, an e-commerce website under Alibaba, are also offering discounts this year, and over one million businesses on Taobao have signed up for the upcoming spree sales, according to a report from Beijing-baed China Times, citing Tian De, director of the fast-moving consumer goods department of Taobao.</p>
<p>Although it is hard to tell how successful this year&#8217;s sales in the shopping spree will be, online shopping has become a rising trend in China. During this year&#8217;s Double 11, over 268 billion yuan ($38 billion) of sales were generated. In comparison, the total sales of Cyber Monday, the most popular online shopping spree in the US reached only $9.4 billion, according to figures from Adobe&#8217;s digital insight report.</p>
<p><strong>New drivers of e-commerce</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind the rising trend is China&#8217;s growing middle classes and young people in counties and townships, who are gaining spending power and becoming the major driving force of China&#8217;s e-commerce industry, Lu Zhenwang, founder of Shanghai Wanqing Commerce Consulting, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Young people in fourth and fifth-tier cities are now used to shopping online for high quality items with lower prices, a wider range of selection and fast shipping services compared with offline retailers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the Double 12 of this year, the presales of JDDJ, an online-to-offline retail platform of China&#8217;s another e-commerce giant JD.com, in tier 3-6 cities grew to 8.7 times last year&#8217;s figure. Among them, the presales in Putian of East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, Zhenjiang of East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, Zhuhai of South China&#8217;s Guangdong and other cities increased by more than 2.5 times compared with last year, the spokesperson of JDDJ told Global Times in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The low-tier markets are proven to satisfy the rising needs of local upgrading consumption, along with the digital transformation and omni-channel strategy (a cross-channel content strategy), of retailers,&#8221; the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increasing channels and e-commerce platforms are providing customers with more reasons to spend, along with the fast-developing shipping business that reduced delivery time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Online sales have become more and more popular in China thanks to China&#8217;s well-developed delivery system, which usually takes less than three days to delivery items,&#8221; Lu said, adding that &#8220;the US retail industry still relies on offline sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent years, companies like JD.com and Pinduoduo have joined in shopping sprees, offering consumers more choices. Promotion methods, meanwhile, have also expanded as more shoppers have turned to videos and online streaming to boost sales, which give consumers a direct and interactive experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rising niche market</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to statistics from Taobao, some of the most popular brands in clothing and skincare have released the prices for the upcoming event. For example, Lancôme has posted discounts of up to 50 percent off some on its most signature products. Armani, Adidas and Nike are also among the brands offering deals as good, if not better, than the Double 11 festival.</p>
<p>However, as a shopping festival only one month later than the Double 11, the spree in December usually receives considerably less anticipation and is not likely to exceed Double 11 in terms of the total sales volume. The December&#8217;s shopping spree still provides a platform for the latest niche products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Double 12 is gaining more importance as an independent shopping festival,&#8221; Lu said, adding that &#8220;the growing purchasing power of Chinese consumers and diversified sales channels and promotion methods are behind this growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike the Tmall, which is famous for the popular brands, the Double 11 for Taobao is for the so-called &#8216;long-tail items&#8217; that are usually targeted toward a more niche customer group and are hard to find on the mainstream market,&#8221; Tian from Taobao said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toys and video games, as well as new brands of apparel are being made ready for the sales in the upcoming event. Nintendo&#8217;s Switch, which is under collaboration with China&#8217;s social media giant Tencent, released on Tuesday at the price of 2099 yuan. As of December 5, a total of 73,283 people have preordered Switchs on the e-commerce platform suning.com, according to eastmoney.com.</p>
<p>Pet products are also expected to see a surge in this year&#8217;s Double 12. According to a report by Taobao, new pet products have become the latest rising trend. Cat beds, for example, have doubled in sales in this year&#8217;s Double 12 presales compared to the same period last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More specified markets are emerging and gaining importance with the spree. Electric heated blankets for dogs, for example, have double presales of the same period last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer demand for the most recent and innovative products is the key to&nbsp; success of e-commerce platforms, and their rising standards have fueled a boom in manufacturing and commerce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The 200-million-strong Chinese middles class whose demand of high-quality goods provided a strong boost to the sales of high-end products,&#8221; Lu said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>An investor identification system for southbound trading under Stock Connect programs between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong is expected to be implemented by the end of 2019, Tim Lui Tim-leung, chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said on Tuesday at a forum in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A draft document related to the system for southbound trading (trading of Hong Kong-listed stocks at mainland stock exchanges) has already been released, according to Lui.</p>
<p>The system is likely to make operations between the SFC and China Securities Regulatory Commission more orderly and offer better investor protection, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The identification mechanism in trading serves as a strong safeguard against fraud, money laundering and insider trading, among other types of financial misconduct,&#8221; Dong said, noting that the system can also closely monitor the cash flows of investors&#8217; accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong and mainland stock exchanges operate under different supervisory regulations,&#8221; Dong said, noting that this discrepancy may lead to misconduct if investors&#8217; identities are not sufficiently disclosed.</p>
<p>The identification system for northbound trading has been in place since September 2018. Under the northbound identification model, brokers are required to report the identity of clients to the mainland stock exchanges, related regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The southbound identification is expected to be conducted in similar fashion, according to an announcement on the SFC website in October.</p>
<p>Stricter supervision is a requirement, given the growing trade between the mainland and Hong Kong, Dong said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its launch, cumulative northbound turnover between the mainland and Hong Kong reached 17.41 trillion yuan ($2.88 trillion) by the end of October, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>

<p>Chinese customs on Saturday returned 46 inbound containers carrying transgenic corn seeds, originally from the US, media reported.</p>
<p>Customs officials in Shantou, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, found grass, live insects and 50 kilograms of corn seeds during an inspection of the mostly empty containers on November 27, which were transferred to Shantou after unloading US corn in the island of Taiwan, the Guangzhou Daily reported on Monday.</p>
<p>It was confirmed after testing that the corn seeds were genetically modified.</p>
<p>In order to prevent genetically modified seeds from entering China without approval &#8211; which could endanger China&#8217;s agriculture, animal husbandry and grain production &#8211;&nbsp; customs officials in Shantou have ordered relevant enterprises to return the containers in accordance with the customs regulation on the inspection and quarantine.</p>
<p>The individual in charge of Shantou&#8217;s customs said the containers, as important means of cargo transportation, could easily deposit a variety of plant seeds, pests and soils during the process of cross-border transportation, and that they could lead to the cross-border spread of epidemic diseases.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A set of simulated sheep in SKP-S in Beijing Photos: Courtesy of SKP </p>
<p>Pushing open the northwest door of SKP-South or SKP-S, one will definitely notice a set of simulated howling sheep. From a distance, they might be mistaken as real despite their color and call. They are placed in sheepfolds, surrounded by fodder, farm tools, and wooden boards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjacent to the flock is a futuristic-looking black machine. The sheep are neatly arranged between a mirror and the machine as if to resemble a flock from another time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two flocks of sheep are located in Beijing SKP&#8217;s new project SKP-S, which will open in mid-December, right across the street from the flagship shopping mall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While some may find it hard to imagine this is a luxury shopping mall, that&#8217;s exactly what is. The difference is this art installation, &#8220;Future Farm,&#8221; makes customers feel like they are visiting an art gallery.</p>
<p>As one of the most upscale malls in Beijing, SKP has always been regarded as the city&#8217;s shopping &#8220;mecca.&#8221; Data from winshang.com showed that Beijing SKP&#8217;s sales in 2018 reached 13.5 billion yuan ($1.92 billion), the highest annual sales of any mall in the Chinese mainland.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Farm of the future</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Future Farm&#8221; is a project of SKP in collaboration with trendy eyewear brand Gentle Monster, hoping to inspire the viewers to think about the new and beyond-imagination ecosystem that development of digital technology has brought to human&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>According to SKP, this area is the &#8220;Art Experience Space&#8221; of SKP-S. Art installations with different themes are launched every year in the hopes of creating cultured shopping experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mall&#8217;s artworks could be a series of sculptures by the Italian artist Quayola, an interactive installation by the Israeli artist Daniel Rozin, and Chinese sculptures by contemporary artist, Xu Zhen.</p>
<p>Other shopping malls in Beijing are in fact increasing art displays and experience projects to lengthen customers&#8217; stay time and make them spend more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want it to be a place where technology, art and fashion are combined and full of customer experience,&#8221; said Xie Dan, vice general manager of SKP, elaborating that &#8220;we also hope to do something different, to embrace more consumers, more young people, and more people who have different ideas or have the daring to try, no matter what age consumers are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rising spending</strong></p>
<p>The opening of the futuristic museum-like SKP-S shopping center is based in rising demand from Chinese consumers.</p>
<p>Li Shasha, a 27-year-old white collar worker, often shops at the mall. She prefers this kind of shopping environment and spends around 50,000 yuan per year in the mall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The new part of the SKP seems very attractive for me,&#8221; she said, explaining that she likes brands that are both low-profile and high-end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li&#8217;s shopping footprint is a small part of what is driving China&#8217;s booming consumption power.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s retail sales of consumer goods amounted to 33.48 trillion yuan in the January-October period, up 8.1 percent year-on-year. Excluding sales of automobiles, the growth rate reached 9 percent during this period, National Bureau Statistics data showed.</p>
<p>A number of multinational retail companies have increased their investment and accelerated the opening of stores in the Chinese market. The retail influx is taking shape in the backdrop of China&#8217;s aims of wider opening-up as consumers pursue high-quality products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, a slew of international companies including Adidas, Nike and Lego have opened new flagship stores in major Chinese cities, while German supermarket chain ALDI entered the Chinese mainland market and Lawson convenience stores swept across third- and fourth-tier cities, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> (MOFCOM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s commercial retail market is rapidly growing and open. The country&#8217;s consumption structure is constantly upgrading, and residents&#8217; consumption is becoming defined by personalized diversification and customization, Gao Feng, spokesperson of MOFCOM said in November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Global eyewear fashion brand Gentle Monster is expecting a bigger presence in the Chinese market by opening more stores and seeking various partnerships.</p>
<p>The brand, headquartered in South Korea, said it has opened 10 stores in the Chinese market in the past three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hankook Kim, Gentle Monster&#8217;s founder and CEO, added that the company would continue to seek partnerships in tech and other sectors to offer more creative products.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may open six or seven stores in China next year, because there are too many cities in China that we have not been to, and there are too many places that we need to learn more about,&#8221; said Kim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump launched his trade war with China more than a year ago to, in part, force manufacturing companies into the US and drive investment out of China. If that was his goal, he has clearly failed, a survey showed on Monday.</p>
<p>While a small number of companies have moved their production out of China &#8211; mostly to Southeast Asia and India &#8211; the same number of firms are increasing their investments in China and adopting a strategy of onshoring their supply chains to avoid tariffs altogether, according to a survey conducted by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;This calls into question the efficacy of the tariffs used by the US, which have failed to achieve their goal of driving investment out of China,&#8221; read a summary of the survey shared with the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>The European Chamber&#8217;s survey offers a stern rebuttal to Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that his trade war has driven businesses out of China while arguing that China wants a trade agreement more desperately than he does.</p>
<p>As recently as November 9, Trump claimed that China&#8217;s &#8220;supply chain is all broken, like an egg. They want to make a deal. Perhaps they have to make a deal, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t care. That&#8217;s up to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trade talks for the anticipated phase-one agreement between China and the US have dragged on, as China continues to insist upon the precondition that existing tariffs must be removed, while the US has shown no sincerity in meeting China&#8217;s demand and has resorted to the threat of tariff hikes.</p>
<p>In response to Trump&#8217;s claims and threats, China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry last week said that China has not set a deadline for a potential trade deal and that, if forced, it would take resolute and effective countermeasures against the US trade bullying.</p>
<p>However, the trade war has had a negative impact on the global supply chain and businesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies, according to the European Chamber&#8217;s survey.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way the US-China trade war could be considered a success is if its goal was to disrupt global supply chains at a modest cost to large corporations, while delivering a steady beating to unlucky China and US-based SMEs on the wrong side of a supply chain,&#8221; the survey read.</p>
<p>The number of European companies in China that export to the US and have been hit by punitive US tariffs has increased from 25 percent to 35 percent of all companies surveyed. About 8 percent said they had moved or were considering moving their production out of China to avoid tariffs, but 6 percent said they have already or are considering increasing their investment in China.</p>
<p>The European Chamber&#8217;s survey is also in line with official data that has pointed to an increase in foreign investment in China, as the country continues to open up more sectors and improve its business conditions.</p>
<p>In the first 10 months of 2019, China attracted a total of 752.41 billion yuan ($106.92 billion) in foreign investment, up 6.6 percent year-on-year, according to data from the Chinese<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a>. A total of 33,407 new foreign-funded companies, or 110 each day, were established during the period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against persistent downward pressure from a deep transition and lingering trade tensions, China has vowed to further open up its market and improve its business climate in 2020 to woo more foreign investment. Most notably, China will implement a new Foreign Investment Law on January 1, 2020, which will guarantee greater market access and better protections for foreign investors.</p>

<p>The Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE), a major commodity bourse in China, launched iron ore options on Monday. The move comes as the world&#8217;s top steel-producing country &#8211; also the largest consumer of raw materials for steelmaking &#8211; offers more risk-hedging tools for iron ore traders and steelmakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The iron ore options will complement the DCE&#8217;s iron ore derivatives offerings, the Economic Daily reported on Monday, citing Li Zhengqiang, chairman of the exchange.</p>
<p>The DCE launched iron ore futures contracts in October 2013 and opened those futures to overseas institutional investors in May 2018. The bourse announced in February that it would to allow foreign individual investors to trade iron ore futures.</p>
<p>The yuan-denominated iron ore futures are also expected to push the internationalization of the Chinese currency, Li said.</p>
<p>Iron ore options can be a lower-risk way &#8211; compared with straight futures contracts &#8211; for traders and steel mills to invest in the futures market, adding to their price management and risk-hedging tools, Xu Xiangchun, information director with iron and steel industry consultancy mysteel.com, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>Buoyed by the launch, the first for industrial commodities on the DCE, the most-active iron ore futures contract hit the daily ceiling of 6 percent intraday on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steel stocks were also given a boost, with the steel sector posting a gain of more than 2 percent on the Chinese mainland stock market on Monday, outperforming the flagship Shanghai Composite Index, which closed up 0.08 percent.</p>
<p>The debut of iron ore options also signals the nation is ramping up efforts to build derivative portfolios.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Shanghai Futures Exchange commenced copper options trading. In 2018, the nation launched white sugar and soybean meal options.</p>
<p>Futures contracts for a wider variety of commodities such as steel scrap futures are in the pipeline, according to Xu.</p>
<p>In another major move, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange over the weekend unveiled rules for the pilot trading of stock options. Market observers believe this will pave the way for MSCI to further increase A-share weighting in setting its global benchmarks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the New York-based index provider&#8217;s most recent public consultation on the inclusion of A shares from September 2018 to February 2019, investors said that access to hedging and derivatives instruments is among the concerns needed to be resolved before any consideration of further inclusion, a spokesperson for MSCI who preferred to be anonymous told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Index futures and options contracts are critical risk-management tools for global investors, particularly for complex, deep and varied equity markets such as those in China,&#8221; the spokesperson said.<br />

<p>China officially separated the energy transport business from the big three state oil companies on Monday by establishing a corporation known as the China Oil &amp; Gas Piping Network Corp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Premier Li Keqiang stressed that the establishment of the new enterprise should promote reform and innovation, and improve the efficiency of the allocation of oil and gas, in a bid to better serve national strategies and improve people&#8217;s welfare.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a significant step in the restructuring of China&#8217;s energy sector, analysts said, making it more open and attractive to competitive private-sector players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new company will specialize in financing, building and operating long-distance oil and natural gas pipelines and dispatch facilities, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Monday.</p>
<p>As an essential part of the reform of natural gas industry, it could help form open upstream and downstream markets while controlling the middle segment, which deals with transportation, said Chen Zhanming, an associate professor of the School of Applied Economics at Renmin University of China.</p>
<p>It offers non-discriminatory access to participants from different sectors to enter the upstream and downstream ends of the industry, Chen said, by removing their concerns about transporting energy to consumers.</p>
<p>Industry insiders said more private companies will be able to participate in China&#8217;s booming gas market, which for years has been monopolized by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Some observers, however, expressed concerns that SOEs&#8217; financial conditions may be affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their income from natural gas businesses account for a steady share of their total revenues. About 40 percent of the new group&#8217;s shares are controlled by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. The big three oil companies hold the rest &#8211; PetroChina with 30 percent, Sinopec with 20 percent and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) with 10 percent, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relevant assets of the three SOEs, including natural gas pipeline networks, gas storage facilities and LNG terminals, will be transferred to the new group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an overhaul for the natural gas industry,&#8221; a source close to the reform agenda said, noting that the creation of an independent entity will improve efficiency and make the market more transparent. By introducing private companies, it will also accelerate the construction of basic infrastructure for energy sectors.</p>
<p>As of the end of 2018, China had 96,000 kilometers of oil and gas pipelines &#8211; 63 percent built by PetroChina, 31 percent by Sinopec and 6 percent by CNOOC. </p>
<p>However, the establishment of a new group that specializes in energy pipelines could mean the interests of the three oil giants may suffer. An employee of PetroChina, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Global Times that he is worried about whether the reform agenda and asset transfer can go forward smoothly, without encountering opposition from the SOEs.&nbsp;</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-08/fc53fc33-27ec-4ae3-9ac8-6820c870d4dd.jpeg"><br />

<p>China&#8217;s trade with the US plunged 11.1 percent to 3.4 trillion yuan ($483 billion) in the first 11 months of the year as the long-running bilateral trade war continued to batter both sides, according to customs data released on Sunday. The 11-month decline widened from a 10.6 percent contraction in the first 10 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, China managed to make up for its worsening trade with the US by beefing up trade with other markets, and it achieved what experts described as generally positive trade volume this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From January to November, China&#8217;s exports to the US slid 8.4 percent to 2.64 trillion yuan, while imports from the US fell 19.5 percent to 763 billion yuan. China&#8217;s trade surplus with the US narrowed 3 percent on a yearly basis to 1.88 trillion yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The accelerating decline of China&#8217;s export to the US in recent months was due to the gradually emerging impact of the intensifying trade war in September,&#8221; He Weiwen, a former senior Chinese trade official and an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, said on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Trump administration started collecting a 15 percent tariff on about $125 billion of targeted goods from China on September 1. The US planned to add an additional tariff of 15 percent on part of some $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that is scheduled to take effect from December 15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent months, China-US trade relations have been imperiled by the ongoing US-initiated trade war. The two countries have not ceased efforts to reach a trade agreement but there are worries that the two largest economies in the world might walk away from the negotiating table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He estimated that bilateral trade will contract at least 10 percent for the entire year of 2019. &#8220;Of course we should actively push the China-US trade negotiations and strive for the phase one agreement as soon as possible. However, we do not need to fear new difficulties, as the general stable (trade) situation has not changed, &#8221; He told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, China&#8217;s trade successfully withstood the negative pressure from the trade war in 2019,&#8221; said Li Wei, senior research fellow of the National Academy of Development and Strategy at Renmin University of China, on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first 11 months of 2019, China&#8217;s total trade increased 2.4 percent year-on-year to 28.5 trillion yuan. Exports were up 4.5 percent while imports were flat with the previous year, customs data showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy for China to achieve 2.4 percent trade growth at a time when international trade is slowing significantly,&#8221; said Li. &#8220;China&#8217;s overall trade status is within my expectations and largely positive.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One positive adjustment, according to Li, is that China has already acted to diversify its import channels under pressure from the trade war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the customs data, China&#8217;s trade with economies along the routes of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative increased 9.9 percent to 8.35 trillion yuan in the first 11 months of this year. Trade with the EU increased 9.5 percent during the period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China has been a little too reliant upon the US market in the past, which led to trade security problems. Now, because of the trade war, China has been forced to speed up diversifying its trade partners. In this sense, the trade war is not all bad,&#8221; Li told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Trade prospects are promising between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a vibrant economic region that is geographically close to China, said Li.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s trade with the bloc jumped 12.7 percent year-on-year in the first 11 months to 3.98 trillion yuan, customs data showed.&nbsp;<br />
