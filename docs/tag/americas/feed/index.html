(Xinhua/NEWSIS)</p>
<p>A Chinese envoy on Wednesday called on the United States and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to move toward each other and resume dialogue and engagement as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Security Council open meeting on the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a>, China&#8217;s Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun said that since the beginning of 2018, there have been positive changes in the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the peninsula issue has been steered back to the right track toward a negotiated solution through dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lately the situation on the Korean Peninsula has taken a twist, leading to renewed tensions between the DPRK and the United States, bringing the peninsula&#8217;s situation to yet another critical juncture,&#8221; said Zhang.</p>
<p>The DPRK has taken a series of positive initiatives on denuclearization, but its legitimate concerns and aspirations in respect of security and development have not been given such attention as is commensurate with its effort, and remain unanswered, said the Chinese ambassador.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an important reason behind the current deadlock in dialogue and the tensing up of the situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zhang said that in the current context, the top priority is to maintain the international consensus and momentum for a political solution to the peninsula issue, support and urge the United States and the DPRK to move toward each other, and &#8220;do everything we can to head off a dramatic reversal of the peninsula&#8217;s situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DPRK and the United States, as the main parties over the peninsula issue, should cherish the hard-won easing of the peninsula&#8217;s situation achieved through dialogue and work together in a practical effort to achieve the denuclearization of, and lasting peace on, the Korean Peninsula, he added.</p>
<p>He said the two parties, especially the United States, should take on board and respect each other&#8217;s concerns in good faith; genuinely demonstrate flexibility and goodwill; act on the consensus contained in the Singapore Joint Statement, and, by taking the phased and synchronized approach, break the deadlock and resume dialogue and engagement as soon as possible, to prevent the dialogue process from &#8220;derailing&#8221; or &#8220;backpedalling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The international community, in particular the main parties to the peninsula issue, must take an objective and impartial position, act in the service of long-term interests and the greater good and make more efforts that contribute to the relaxation of the situation, to the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and consultation and to the peninsula&#8217;s political process, so that the peninsula will not be plunged once again into tensions and confrontations, the Chinese envoy said.</p>
<p>Denuclearization negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since February&#8217;s second summit in Hanoi between the DPRK&#8217;s top leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump ended without a deal. The two leaders first met in Singapore in June 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<br />This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of China-U.S. diplomatic relations.

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m sure this experience has given you a heightened understanding of the Chinese culture and Chinese people and the development of our country in this process. Many of you have also become active participants in the cultural exchanges between the two countries, and I&#8217;m sure it will become a valuable asset in your life,&#8221; said Zhao.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;US President Donald Trump paid a surprise visit to Afghanistan on Thursday evening, meeting with his Afghan counterpart Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and spending Thanksgiving with US troops stationed in the country. </p>
<p>It was Trump&#8217;s first trip to the war-torn country since becoming president. </p>
<p>&#8220;In our bilateral meeting, we discussed the important progress we have jointly made in our military efforts in the battlefield, including crushing the Daesh (Islamic State or IS group) in eastern Afghanistan. President Trump appreciated the tireless efforts of the Afghan security forces in this fight,&#8221; Ghani said on Twitter early on Friday. </p>
<p>During the meeting at Bagram Air Base, the main US and coalition military base, some 50 km north of Kabul, both sides underscored that &#8220;if the Taliban are sincere in their commitment to reaching a peace deal, they must accept a ceasefire.&#8221; </p>
<p>After the meeting, the two presidents joined the US troops and delivered speeches and offered their Thanksgiving greetings, Ghani added. </p>
<p>&#8220;We thanked them and their Afghan counterparts for their continued efforts and sacrifices in combating terrorism,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>The war in Afghanistan is the longest war in US history. The death toll of US service members has surpassed 2,400 since the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001. </p>
<p>According to the statistics from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, 2018 was the deadliest year on record for the Afghan conflict, with a total of 10,993 civilian casualties, including 3,804 civilian deaths.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Cuba hopes to generate a quarter of its energy needs from renewable sources over the next decade, an industry official said on Thursday. </p>
<p>The government&#8217;s Renewable Energy Development Program aims to raise clean energy output from today&#8217;s 4 percent to 24 percent by 2030, said Tatiana Amaran, general director of electricity at the Ministry of Energy and Mines. </p>

(Xinhua/Joaquin Hernandez)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The plan focuses on solar power, but other alternative sources have also been prioritized, including bioelectric plants linked to the sugar industry, wind farms and hydraulic power facilities, said Amaran. </p>
<p>Cuban authorities are courting foreign investment in this area by offering incentives and tax breaks. </p>
<p>They also implemented new legal norms, which took effect Thursday, to allow businesses and households to sell any surplus energy they generate from solar panels to the state-run Electrical Union. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cuba now gets 96 percent of its power from fossil fuels, but it has made headway in green energy. Between January and October, it generated 687,000 megawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydropower, solar, cane and non-cane biomass, saving 178,000 tons of fossil fuel.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump turned the quirky annual White House ritual of pardoning Thanksgiving turkeys into a riff on his impeachment Tuesday, joking that the two birds had been subpoenaed to testify.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff&#8217;s basement on Thursday,&#8221; Trump said in the Rose Garden, referring to the head of the intelligence committee leading the impeachment probe in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Trump was presiding over a ceremony where the president symbolically spares a specially chosen turkey from joining the more than 45 million estimated to be consumed nationwide at Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>After online polls, a large white bird named Butter won a close vote over his competitor, Bread. Both will be sent to a site known as Gobbler&#8217;s Rest at Virginia Tech University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Butter, I wish you a lot of luck. I hereby grant you a full and complete pardon,&#8221; Trump said.</p>

<p>Canada&#8217;s Governor General Julie Payette on Wednesday started a two-day visit to Estonia for talks on bilateral ties and cooperation.</p>
<p>Payette met with Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid, Prime Minister Juri Ratas and President of Estonian parliament (Riigikogu) Henn Polluaas on the first day of her official visit to the Baltic country.</p>
<p>Kaljulaid referred to the &#8220;special bond between our peoples,&#8221; as around 25,000 people of Estonian descent currently live in Canada, which is one of the largest communities outside Estonia, the Estonian president&#8217;s office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Payette and her hosts discussed security and climate policy as well as digital cooperation. Canadian troops lead NATO&#8217;s enhanced Forward Presence battlegroup in Latvia.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera (center) announces at La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, Chile on Wednesday that Chile has withdrawn as host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Forum in November and the Climate Change COP25 Conference in December after several weeks of violent protests. The APEC summit was scheduled to bring together 20 world leaders from November 16 to 17. The COP25 program was due to run between December 2 and December 13. “This has been a very difficult decision, a decision that causes us a lot of pain, because we fully understand the importance of APEC and COP25 for Chile and for the world,” Pinera said, according to Reuters.

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chile&#8217;s President Sebastian Pinera will skip an important global climate change conference, which his country was supposed to host, amid ongoing unrest at home, a top official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pinera had earlier canceled hosting the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP25) as anti-government protests roiled major cities. Spain then offered to hold the event in Madrid from Dec. 2 to 13.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Pinera will not attend the conference. He has told us there&#8217;s urgent work to do in Chile, which is why he will be staying,&#8221; said his Minister of Environment Carolina Schmidt.</p>
<p>As Chile&#8217;s envoy, Schmidt said she will chair the conference.</p>
<p>At the end of October, Pinera announced his government would not be able to host the COP25 due to the social upheaval, but ratified his &#8220;total and absolute commitment&#8221; to the conference.</p>
<p>Chileans have taken to the streets to demand better living conditions and improvements in essential services, such as healthcare, housing and education.</p>
<p>Protests have occasionally turned violent, leading to clashes with security forces.</p>

<br />Colombian President Ivan Duque on Wednesday lauded the signing of a contract with APCA Transmimetro, a Chinese railway construction consortium, to build the first subway line in its capital Bogota.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bogota has been dreaming of this for decades. Today we take another step and I would say that it is the most important, the signing of the contract,&#8221; said Duque.</p>
<p>&#8220;The formal construction of the subway starts now. The transformation of our capital starts now. The largest investment in the history of the city starts now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Presiding over the signing of the deal at the presidential headquarters in Bogota, Duque said that the project was set to further China-Colombia collaboration in infrastructure development.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure that the successful construction of Bogota&#8217;s subway will open frontiers to more projects,&#8221; he said, noting that the event coincided with the coming 40th anniversary of bilateral ties.</p>
<p>He also said that during a recent visit to China, he and Chinese officials spoke of the importance of &#8220;having more Chinese companies want to come to Colombia to invest in infrastructure projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the European Investment Bank are also participating in the project, which is expected to generate some 60,000 jobs, according to Duque.</p>
<p>Consortium APCA Transmimetro, comprised of China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. and Xi&#8217;an Metro Company Ltd., will be involved in every aspect of the project, from design, partial financing, building the stations and supplying the trains, to operating the system for 20 years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />The White House on Wednesday bashed again the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump led by House Democrats, without confirming whether the president would appear for a congressional hearing next week to which he was invited. </p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, the US House Judiciary Committee issued a statement saying it would hold an impeachment inquiry hearing on Dec. 4. Committee chairman Jerry Nadler sent Trump a letter, inviting him and his counsel to participate in the hearing. </p>
<p>The White House &#8220;is currently reviewing Chairman Nadler&#8217;s letter, but what is obvious to every American is that this letter comes at the end of an illegitimate sham partisan process,&#8221; White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. &#8220;The president has done nothing wrong, and the Democrats know it.&#8221; </p>
<p>The judiciary panel&#8217;s announcement came as House Democrats conducting the impeachment inquiry hosted a number of closed-door depositions and public testimonies to try to establish a case of the president abusing his office to solicit foreign interference that would help with his re-election &#8212; a claim that Trump and his administration have repeatedly denied. </p>
<p>Although Grisham gave no indication as to whether Trump or his lawyers would accept the invitation, US media reported that they expressed suspicion privately about participating in a process they considered unfair to the president. </p>
<p>Nadler told Trump in the letter that the upcoming hearing would feature a discussion of the &#8220;constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry,&#8221; and that lawmakers would be looking into whether Trump&#8217;s &#8220;alleged actions warrant the House&#8217;s exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment.&#8221; </p>
<p>The chairman notified Trump of his right to attend the hearing, as well as his counsel&#8217;s right to question the witnesses, adding that he hoped that the president &#8220;chooses to participate in the inquiry, directly or through counsel, as other Presidents have done before him.&#8221; </p>
<p>Trump is required to notify the committee no later than Sunday whether he will show up at the hearing, according to Nadler. &#8220;By that time, I ask that you also indicate who will act as your counsel for these proceedings,&#8221; he wrote in the letter. </p>
<p>The judiciary panel is tasked with drafting articles of impeachment based on a report by the House Intelligence Committee, which is now leading the investigations, and summarizing key findings relating to allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to launch investigations that would have benefited him personally. </p>
<p>Adam Schiff, who heads the intelligence committee, wrote in a letter to lawmakers Monday that his team is expected to complete the report as soon as Congress returns from the Thanksgiving break.</p>
