<p>&nbsp;US President Donald Trump paid a surprise visit to Afghanistan on Thursday evening, meeting with his Afghan counterpart Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and spending Thanksgiving with US troops stationed in the country. </p>
<p>It was Trump&#8217;s first trip to the war-torn country since becoming president. </p>
<p>&#8220;In our bilateral meeting, we discussed the important progress we have jointly made in our military efforts in the battlefield, including crushing the Daesh (Islamic State or IS group) in eastern Afghanistan. President Trump appreciated the tireless efforts of the Afghan security forces in this fight,&#8221; Ghani said on Twitter early on Friday. </p>
<p>During the meeting at Bagram Air Base, the main US and coalition military base, some 50 km north of Kabul, both sides underscored that &#8220;if the Taliban are sincere in their commitment to reaching a peace deal, they must accept a ceasefire.&#8221; </p>
<p>After the meeting, the two presidents joined the US troops and delivered speeches and offered their Thanksgiving greetings, Ghani added. </p>
<p>&#8220;We thanked them and their Afghan counterparts for their continued efforts and sacrifices in combating terrorism,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>The war in Afghanistan is the longest war in US history. The death toll of US service members has surpassed 2,400 since the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001. </p>
<p>According to the statistics from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, 2018 was the deadliest year on record for the Afghan conflict, with a total of 10,993 civilian casualties, including 3,804 civilian deaths.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Cuba hopes to generate a quarter of its energy needs from renewable sources over the next decade, an industry official said on Thursday. </p>
<p>The government&#8217;s Renewable Energy Development Program aims to raise clean energy output from today&#8217;s 4 percent to 24 percent by 2030, said Tatiana Amaran, general director of electricity at the Ministry of Energy and Mines. </p>

(Xinhua/Joaquin Hernandez)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The plan focuses on solar power, but other alternative sources have also been prioritized, including bioelectric plants linked to the sugar industry, wind farms and hydraulic power facilities, said Amaran. </p>
<p>Cuban authorities are courting foreign investment in this area by offering incentives and tax breaks. </p>
<p>They also implemented new legal norms, which took effect Thursday, to allow businesses and households to sell any surplus energy they generate from solar panels to the state-run Electrical Union. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cuba now gets 96 percent of its power from fossil fuels, but it has made headway in green energy. Between January and October, it generated 687,000 megawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydropower, solar, cane and non-cane biomass, saving 178,000 tons of fossil fuel.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump turned the quirky annual White House ritual of pardoning Thanksgiving turkeys into a riff on his impeachment Tuesday, joking that the two birds had been subpoenaed to testify.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff&#8217;s basement on Thursday,&#8221; Trump said in the Rose Garden, referring to the head of the intelligence committee leading the impeachment probe in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Trump was presiding over a ceremony where the president symbolically spares a specially chosen turkey from joining the more than 45 million estimated to be consumed nationwide at Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>After online polls, a large white bird named Butter won a close vote over his competitor, Bread. Both will be sent to a site known as Gobbler&#8217;s Rest at Virginia Tech University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Butter, I wish you a lot of luck. I hereby grant you a full and complete pardon,&#8221; Trump said.</p>

<p>Canada&#8217;s Governor General Julie Payette on Wednesday started a two-day visit to Estonia for talks on bilateral ties and cooperation.</p>
<p>Payette met with Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid, Prime Minister Juri Ratas and President of Estonian parliament (Riigikogu) Henn Polluaas on the first day of her official visit to the Baltic country.</p>
<p>Kaljulaid referred to the &#8220;special bond between our peoples,&#8221; as around 25,000 people of Estonian descent currently live in Canada, which is one of the largest communities outside Estonia, the Estonian president&#8217;s office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Payette and her hosts discussed security and climate policy as well as digital cooperation. Canadian troops lead NATO&#8217;s enhanced Forward Presence battlegroup in Latvia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a similar understanding of the challenges we face on this planet &#8212; combating climate change and ensuring peace and security,&#8221; Kaljulaid was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Payette, Canadian astronaut and engineer, and Kaljulaid also attended a technology course at Tallinn Secondary School of Science, participating in a forum with members of the Estonian Space School Network and students in the space program at the Tallinn University of Technology.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Payette is scheduled to visit the e-Estonia Showroom, the Estonian Academy of Sciences and the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera (center) announces at La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, Chile on Wednesday that Chile has withdrawn as host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Forum in November and the Climate Change COP25 Conference in December after several weeks of violent protests. The APEC summit was scheduled to bring together 20 world leaders from November 16 to 17. The COP25 program was due to run between December 2 and December 13. “This has been a very difficult decision, a decision that causes us a lot of pain, because we fully understand the importance of APEC and COP25 for Chile and for the world,” Pinera said, according to Reuters. Photo: AP </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chile&#8217;s President Sebastian Pinera will skip an important global climate change conference, which his country was supposed to host, amid ongoing unrest at home, a top official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pinera had earlier canceled hosting the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP25) as anti-government protests roiled major cities. Spain then offered to hold the event in Madrid from Dec. 2 to 13.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Pinera will not attend the conference. He has told us there&#8217;s urgent work to do in Chile, which is why he will be staying,&#8221; said his Minister of Environment Carolina Schmidt.</p>
<p>As Chile&#8217;s envoy, Schmidt said she will chair the conference.</p>
<p>At the end of October, Pinera announced his government would not be able to host the COP25 due to the social upheaval, but ratified his &#8220;total and absolute commitment&#8221; to the conference.</p>
<p>Chileans have taken to the streets to demand better living conditions and improvements in essential services, such as healthcare, housing and education.</p>
<p>Protests have occasionally turned violent, leading to clashes with security forces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Colombian President Ivan Duque on Wednesday lauded the signing of a contract with APCA Transmimetro, a Chinese railway construction consortium, to build the first subway line in its capital Bogota.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bogota has been dreaming of this for decades. Today we take another step and I would say that it is the most important, the signing of the contract,&#8221; said Duque.</p>
<p>&#8220;The formal construction of the subway starts now. The transformation of our capital starts now. The largest investment in the history of the city starts now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Presiding over the signing of the deal at the presidential headquarters in Bogota, Duque said that the project was set to further China-Colombia collaboration in infrastructure development.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure that the successful construction of Bogota&#8217;s subway will open frontiers to more projects,&#8221; he said, noting that the event coincided with the coming 40th anniversary of bilateral ties.</p>
<p>He also said that during a recent visit to China, he and Chinese officials spoke of the importance of &#8220;having more Chinese companies want to come to Colombia to invest in infrastructure projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the European Investment Bank are also participating in the project, which is expected to generate some 60,000 jobs, according to Duque.</p>
<p>Consortium APCA Transmimetro, comprised of China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. and Xi&#8217;an Metro Company Ltd., will be involved in every aspect of the project, from design, partial financing, building the stations and supplying the trains, to operating the system for 20 years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />The White House on Wednesday bashed again the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump led by House Democrats, without confirming whether the president would appear for a congressional hearing next week to which he was invited. </p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, the US House Judiciary Committee issued a statement saying it would hold an impeachment inquiry hearing on Dec. 4. Committee chairman Jerry Nadler sent Trump a letter, inviting him and his counsel to participate in the hearing. </p>
<p>The White House &#8220;is currently reviewing Chairman Nadler&#8217;s letter, but what is obvious to every American is that this letter comes at the end of an illegitimate sham partisan process,&#8221; White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. &#8220;The president has done nothing wrong, and the Democrats know it.&#8221; </p>
<p>The judiciary panel&#8217;s announcement came as House Democrats conducting the impeachment inquiry hosted a number of closed-door depositions and public testimonies to try to establish a case of the president abusing his office to solicit foreign interference that would help with his re-election &#8212; a claim that Trump and his administration have repeatedly denied. </p>
<p>Although Grisham gave no indication as to whether Trump or his lawyers would accept the invitation, US media reported that they expressed suspicion privately about participating in a process they considered unfair to the president. </p>
<p>Nadler told Trump in the letter that the upcoming hearing would feature a discussion of the &#8220;constitutional framework through which the House may analyze the evidence gathered in the present inquiry,&#8221; and that lawmakers would be looking into whether Trump&#8217;s &#8220;alleged actions warrant the House&#8217;s exercising its authority to adopt articles of impeachment.&#8221; </p>
<p>The chairman notified Trump of his right to attend the hearing, as well as his counsel&#8217;s right to question the witnesses, adding that he hoped that the president &#8220;chooses to participate in the inquiry, directly or through counsel, as other Presidents have done before him.&#8221; </p>
<p>Trump is required to notify the committee no later than Sunday whether he will show up at the hearing, according to Nadler. &#8220;By that time, I ask that you also indicate who will act as your counsel for these proceedings,&#8221; he wrote in the letter. </p>
<p>The judiciary panel is tasked with drafting articles of impeachment based on a report by the House Intelligence Committee, which is now leading the investigations, and summarizing key findings relating to allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to launch investigations that would have benefited him personally. </p>
<p>Adam Schiff, who heads the intelligence committee, wrote in a letter to lawmakers Monday that his team is expected to complete the report as soon as Congress returns from the Thanksgiving break.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bolivia appointed its first Ambassador to the US in 11 years on Tuesday, officials said, as the interim government resets the country&#8217;s foreign policy after the departure of Evo Morales.</p>
<p>Walter Oscar Serrate Cuellar &#8211; previously Bolivia&#8217;s ambassador and permanent representative at the United ­Nations &#8211; has been given the key posting, the foreign ministry announced on Twitter, filling a position left vacant since a diplomatic spat between La Paz and Washington in 2008.</p>
<p>The high-profile appointment, which has to be approved by the Senate, came as the caretaker government prepares to hold new elections that exclude Morales.</p>
<p>Under Morales, Bolivia&#8217;s president for nearly 14 years, ties with the US were tense.</p>
<p>Relations took a turn for the worse under former US president George W. Bush, with the expulsion of ambassadors from both countries in late 2008.</p>
<p>Morales resigned on November 10 and fled to Mexico where he was granted political asylum after disputed October 20 elections ignited street protests.</p>
<p>Morales, who had been seeking a fourth term, claimed victory, but opposition groups said the results were rigged.</p>
<p>Since declaring herself interim president, right-wing senator Jeanine Anez, who has been recognized by the US, has wasted no time rewriting Bolivia&#8217;s foreign policy. She broke ties with socialist Cuba and Nicolas Maduro&#8217;s Venezuela.</p>
<p>Anez&#8217;s first foreign policy decision was to recognize Venezuela&#8217;s opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country&#8217;s president, joining a group of around 50 countries.</p>
<p>Bolivian Foreign Minister Karen Longaric announced Venezuelan diplomats would be sent home for &#8220;violating diplomatic norms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bolivia also fired all its ambassadors except those to Peru and the Vatican.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement came as some 20 former members of Morales&#8217; government were holed up in the Mexican Embassy in La Paz, the foreign ministry said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Five of them &#8211; including Morales&#8217; former top minister Juan Ramon Quintana &#8211; are wanted for arrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Morales and Quintana have been accused of sedition and terrorism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump launched a task force on Tuesday to help protect Native American women and children, calling the rate of violence among indigenous people &#8220;heartbreaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The task force aims to improve coordination and communication among federal, state and tribal authorities in response to cases of missing and murdered indigenous women and children, the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>Native American women in some tribal communities are 10 times more likely than the average American to be murdered, it said, and the initiative called Operation Lady Justice is an &#8220;aggressive, government-wide strategy&#8221; to address the crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The statistics are sobering and heartbreaking,&#8221; Trump said at a White House ceremony where he signed an executive order creating the task force. &#8220;Too many are still missing and their whereabouts are unknown.&#8221;</p>
<p>Research by the National Institute of Justice, a government research agency, has found more than four out of five Indigenous American and Alaska Native women, more than 1.5 million ­women, have experienced violence in their ­lifetime. More than 5,700 American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls were reported missing in 2016, according to the National Crime Information Center, a government data agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indigenous American women are two-and-a-half times more likely to be sexually assaulted than women of all other races, while one in three reports having been raped, the US Department of Justice has said.</p>
<p>Several leading Native American rights organizations did not respond to requests for comment on the new task force. Law enforcement and prosecutions are often hampered by a maze of jurisdictions and justice systems based on such factors as whether a crime occurred on tribal land or whether the victim or the accused is a tribal member.</p>
<p>Last week the government announced an initiative to spend $1.5 million for law enforcement to help coordinate Native American missing persons cases.</p>
<p>Nearly 7 million Native Americans live in the US making up about 2 percent of the population, according to census figures.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Kate Schapira sits behind her &#8220;climate anxiety&#8221; booth in a public space in Providence, the United States, in June 2018. Photo: AFP </p>
<p>In the melting Arctic, communities are racing to maintain their way of life. In the rising Pacific, residents are sounding alarm bells. And in Rhode Island, Kate Schapira and her husband are not having a baby.</p>
<p>Fears about climate change are prompting worldwide action, but one knock-on effect in the United States is mounting anxiety about everything from plastics to class-based environmental disparities.</p>
<p>Schapira, a 40-year-old senior lecturer in the English department at Brown University, is addressing that unease in a number of ways.</p>
<p>The decision not to have children was not just about concern for their future wellbeing amid environmental degradation, she explained, but also about not wanting &#8220;my sense of responsibility to the world to shrink down to the size of one person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schapira also says she has likely taken her last flight.</p>
<p>She said she was troubled that people were treating her climate fears &#8220;like a personal, individual problem,&#8221; she said, and she wanted to &#8220;see if that was actually the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>So in 2014, Schapira started setting up a &#8220;climate anxiety&#8221; booth in public spaces, such as farmers&#8217; markets. It&#8217;s a bit like Lucy&#8217;s psychiatry stall from the beloved comic Peanuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Climate anxiety counseling, 5 cents. The doctor is in,&#8221; the booth&#8217;s sign reads, welcoming passersby in Providence to talk about their fears.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Schapira was far from alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Widespread worry</strong></p>
<p>About six in 10 Americans say they are at least &#8220;somewhat worried&#8221; about global warming and 23 percent say they are &#8220;very worried,&#8221; according to a survey conducted by Yale and George Mason universities in March and April.</p>
<p>Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said Americans can be broken into six categories based on their reaction to climate change, ranging from alarmed to dismissive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The common wisdom is that only upper-middle-class, white, well-educated, latte-sipping liberals care about climate change. Turns out that&#8217;s not true,&#8221; Leiserowitz said.</p>
<p>None of the six groups is majorly driven by one demographic, he said, with the exception of the &#8220;dismissives&#8221; &#8211; where &#8220;well-educated conservative white men&#8221; reign.</p>
<p>They are &#8220;dramatically different in terms of how they perceive the risk than everybody else,&#8221; he said, thanks in large part to &#8220;a world view that we call individualism&#8221; &#8211; particularly pronounced in that group.</p>
<p>Of course, that same demographic also happens to control the White House, half of Congress and many of the nation&#8217;s richest companies, such as in the fossil fuel industry.</p>
<p>As the world&#8217;s top experts head to Spain for the UN summit on climate change opening Monday, Americans must deal with the idea that President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Everyone&#8217; has climate anxiety</strong></p>
<p>For Lise Van Susteren, a Washington-based psychiatrist who has been studying the mental health impacts of climate change for 15 years, refusal to recognize the potential hazards is common for &#8220;people who are trying to deny that they too are vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I actually have no hesitation in saying that on some level, I believe that everyone now has some climate anxiety,&#8221; Van Susteren said.</p>
<p>Psychological responses to climate change such as &#8220;conflict avoidance, fatalism, fear, helplessness and resignation are growing,&#8221; according to a 2017 report by the American Psychological Association and ecoAmerica.</p>
<p>And they coincide with an array of physical health impacts, such as asthma and allergies.</p>
<p>At a happy hour for environmentalists in Washington, Alicia Cannon &#8211; who works in environmental policy lobbying &#8211; was asked whether she was experiencing any climate anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her response: &#8220;Oh God, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of people that work in climate feel some kind of climate anxiety because it&#8217;s such a large-scale issue and it&#8217;s overwhelming and you feel that it&#8217;s overwhelming because of helplessness,&#8221; the 23-year-old said.</p>
<p>According to Van Susteren, such feelings can lead people to question whether their individual actions are meaningful in light of the vast nature of the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do individually is counted collectively,&#8221; she said, indicating that one person&#8217;s behaviors can help establish consequential social norms.</p>
<p>Debbie Chang, 43, who organized a group counseling session on dealing with climate anxiety on the National Mall in Washington in May, has also decided not to have kids and tries to follow a zero-waste policy.</p>
<p>She keeps chopsticks in her purse to avoid single-use plastic utensils, carries a handkerchief to substitute for paper napkins, and brings a steel container with her to restaurants for any leftovers she might want.</p>
<p>Chang said until not that long ago, it was difficult to find information on &#8220;climate anxiety, climate grief, climate despair, climate counseling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now &#8220;there&#8217;s more &#8230; people are starting to realize it&#8217;s a thing,&#8221; she added.</p>
