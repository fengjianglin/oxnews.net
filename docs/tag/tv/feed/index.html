<p>The upcoming latest episode of reality show<br />
<em>Encounter,</em> which will be made available on Tencent Video on Tuesday, will see Chinese musicians Aya, Tan Weiwei and Xiao He collect children&#8217;s folk songs in local dialects in Hangzhou and other neighboring areas in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passed down by word of mouth through the generations, children&#8217;s songs in local dialects are facing extinction due to rapid urbanization and social changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the show, the musicians seek out the original songs and then remake them&nbsp; to fit today&#8217;s modern times in order to remind people of the long-unheard voices of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second season of the show currently has a high rating of 7.6/10 on Chinese media review site Douban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s director Zhao Qi said that the second season, which kicked off on October 22, will &#8220;return to humanity itself.&#8221; The first season once raised questions about life and death, topics commonly discussed by many families.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Adele Haenel Photo: IC</p>
<p>French star Adele Haenel lodged a complaint on Tuesday against a film director she claims sexually harassed her between the ages of 12 and 15, her lawyers said.</p>
<p>The actress shook the French film industry earlier this month with accusations about being repeatedly touched and kissed by Christophe Ruggia, who directed her in her first film role.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old winner of two French Oscars initially refused to bring charges because she said so few sexual assault cases come to court in France. But she changed her mind and went to a police station in a Paris suburb on Tuesday to make a formal complaint against Ruggia.</p>
<p>The director, now 54, initially denied the accusations before asking Haenel to forgive him, saying: &#8220;I did not see that my adulation and the hopes I placed in her, might &#8211; given her young age &#8211; be distressing [for her].&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paris prosecutors had already opened a preliminary investigation after she detailed the alleged abuse in a lengthy livestreamed interview to investigative website Mediapart.</p>
<p>The interview was seen as a turning point for the #MeToo movement in France. It helped galvanize renewed criticism of controversial director Roman Polanski, whose new film An Officer and a Spy was released in France earlier this month.</p>
<p>Polanski, who has French citizenship, has been a fugitive from US justice since 1978 after admitting to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in a plea bargain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Days before his historical thriller opened, a French photographer claimed that Polanski had raped her in 1975 when she was 18 after beating her &#8220;into submission&#8221; at his Swiss chalet.</p>
<p>Valentine Monnier, a former model and actress, said she was pushed to finally speak out when the director compared himself to Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer wrongly persecuted as a spy by the French army at the turn of the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">An app store featuring the Netflix app Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Streaming giant Netflix will use New York&#8217;s historic Paris theater, which had been shuttered earlier this year, for special events and screenings of its films &#8211; the latest twist in the company&#8217;s ongoing spat with the traditional film industry.</p>
<p>The theater &#8211; the city&#8217;s last single screen movie house, located in the heart of Manhattan on 57th Street, not far from Central Park and the Plaza hotel &#8211; closed in late August after 71 years in business.</p>
<p>It had reopened in early November for what seemed like a one-off event &#8211; a limited theatrical run for Netflix&#8217;s Oscar contender<br />
<em>Marriage Story</em> by New York director Noah Baumbach.</p>
<p>But it would seem that Netflix had bigger plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, the iconic theater will be kept open and become a home for special Netflix events, screenings, and theatrical releases,&#8221; the company said Monday in a series of Twitter messages.</p>
<p>The details of the deal were not disclosed, but industry site Deadline Hollywood said it was a 10-year lease agreement.</p>
<p>Netflix has been in a low-grade battle with traditional Hollywood for some time over the Oscar eligibility requirements that films in contention run in regular theaters for a certain period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But many major theater chains have refused to deal with Netflix unless it consents to longer runs of its films &#8211; and a longer waiting period between any film&#8217;s theatrical release and its streaming debut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, the waiting period generally agreed upon by studios and the major chains is 90 days.</p>
<p>That means Netflix has relied thus far on indie movie houses for its releases, but the leasing of the Paris theater would seem to mark a new phase in its strategy.</p>
<p>For months, it has reportedly been in talks to buy the historic Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.</p>
<p>On Monday, Deadline Hollywood reported that Netflix had indeed acquired a majority stake in that Los Angeles venue, but Netflix has yet to confirm the deal.</p>
<p>The Paris theater opened in 1948, when screen legend Marlene Dietrich cut the ribbon. It turned into one of the country&#8217;s most notable art house theaters, focusing on films often ignored by multiplexes.</p>

<p>A new TV drama<br />
<em>Without Knowing Dawn Break in the East</em> will debut in Sohu Video on December 25.</p>
<p>The legal romance drama will feature hot social topics such as sexual assault, celebrity image rights and professional ethics for lawyers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an adaptation of the popular legal romance novel of the same name by writer Ju Ziyi, the drama is sure to bring in fans of the novel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A trailer and posters for the show were released on Tuesday. Chinese actor Wang Renjun and actress Zhang Jingjing will play the lead roles. Snippets of court room drama and gun battles were revealed in the one-minute trailer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, dramas about forensic medicine, police, prosecutors and office life have become popular in China, but the slow development of legal drama has been a major topic of discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest birthday party the world has ever seen is being held this year as nearly 1.4 billion people across China are marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China with a year-long celebration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mark this historical moment, a China-foreign co-produced documentary aired on China Central Television and National Geographic channels around the world on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 44-minute documentary,<br />
<em>World&#8217;s Biggest Birthday Party</em>, was co-produced by the China Intercontinental Communication Center (CICC) with support from the National Geographic Channel and UK&#8217;s Meridian Line Films.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stories about China have been an important source of inspiration for our work. The rich history and culture of China has been continuously providing a bounty of material for our creations,&#8221; said Pei Yiqun, senior vice president of Walt Disney Company China (National Geographic is operated by Disney), at a launch ceremony for the documentary held on Tuesday in Beijing.</p>
<p>Pei also noted that they wanted to bring in National Geographic&#8217;s storytelling experience to tell China&#8217;s story in an international way that could reveal the real China to the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on major events, the documentary looks back on the past seven decades through a dozen stories of ordinary people who have made extraordinary contributions. Tang Yutong, a martial arts student at the reputed Shaolin Temple, expresses his pride at performing in the 70th anniversary parade on October 1 at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Li Guowei, a chef from Sichuan Province in Southwest China, known for its spicy food, decides to create a dish that brings together flavors across the country. A two-year-old toddler, You Ruiyi, and her family celebrates her birthday, which she shares with the country, as the military parade for the 70th anniversary plays on the TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The show begins with a farmer in Panjin [Northeast China&#8217;s Liaoning Province] who has a big smile on her face,&#8221; said Ding Gang, a senior fellow of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting the film with a story related to agriculture does much to reveal the changes that have taken place throughout the country over the past 70 years,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Farmer, rural areas, agriculture, these words were closely related to toil and poverty in the past, and were a major component of the PRC, which was built from scratch 70 years ago. Yet now, they have become the basis for the happy life of 1.4 billion Chinese people,&#8221; Ding said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to bring the freshest messages, the liveliest images and the most touching stories of China to the world,&#8221; remarked Jing Shuiqing, vice president of CICC.</p>
<p>Jing also spoke highly of the efforts they undertook to boost the integration of media for the show. In addition to airing on broadcast channels, the documentary is also available on Chinese streaming platforms such as Bilibili, Youku, iQIYI and Kuaishou.<br />

<p>There are more opportunities to further deepen exchanges and cooperation between the film and TV industries of China and the US, industry insiders from both countries have said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to explore mutually-beneficial cultural relationships between the United States and China. We have much to offer each other,&#8221; Liao Ken, vice chairman of the China Television Artists Association, said at the 2019 US-China Television and Film Innovation Summit.</p>
<p>Liao led a Chinese delegation of television and film industry insiders to Hollywood from Sunday to Tuesday, during which the delegation attended the summit and met with representatives from the Writers Guild of America (WGA), the Producers Guild of America (PGA) and high-profile Hollywood production companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to working together with Hollywood experts,&#8221; said Zhang Heng, vice president of Chinese streaming giant iQIYI, also a member of the delegation.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first went to China in 1997, I believe there were about 1,000 cinema screens and a box office of probably $150 million. Now, 22 years later, there are 60,000 cinema screens and a box office of nearly $9 billion &#8211; that&#8217;s something to take seriously,&#8221; said US producer Arthur Sarkissian, who was mainly known as one of the producers of Chinese movie star Jackie Chan&#8217;s Rush Hour series.</p>
<p>Chris McGurk, chairman and CEO of US entertainment company Cinedigm whose new platform Bambu is providing Chinese and Asian-centric programming for the US market, said that &#8220;there should be one or more online services to stream Chinese content to American audiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;China produces some great content, but nobody watches it in the US yet. It hasn&#8217;t found a market here,&#8221; McGurk said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;A platform with tons of data on what Americans like or don&#8217;t like can be extremely helpful,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important contributor to our success was that we respected the culture and people of China, and their differences. A lot of research went into getting it right,&#8221; Belle Avery, producer of US-China co-produced hit The Meg, told the Xinhua News Agency at the summit.</p>
<p>It is important to find &#8220;the right partner with a similar shared business approach, business ethics and transparency,&#8221; explained Ellen Eliasoph, CEO of pioneering China-US joint venture Perfect Village Entertainment.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Daley, dean of the School of Cinematic Arts of the University of Southern California, encouraged filmmakers to accept and navigate genuine differences between the two countries in the co-production process.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the mistakes we make as Americans is we think everybody is just like us, and other cultures think everybody is just like them. We&#8217;re both wrong,&#8221; Daley said.</p>

<p>Extreme sports documentary<br />
<em>The Journey of Ultimate Challenge</em>, produced by Toutiao, Watermelon Video and OXStudio, made its China debut on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first episode tracked two of the world&#8217;s top freestyle kayakers, Dane Jackson and Nick Troutman, as they took on the Detian Waterfall in Southwest China&#8217;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The largest waterfall in Asia, the Detian Waterfall is more than 200 meters wide and drops more than 70 meters. The average annual flow over the waterfall is 50 cubic meters per second, and the geology of the area is thick-layered dolomite. Water rushes down a three-tiered cliff with tremendous force, making navigation even more difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the first attempt by Dane, he fails and hurts his right arm. During a second attempt, the two are joined by three Chinese members. After several attempts over a few days, the team finally overcomes the challenging waters in the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The series is now available for streaming on the Toutiao and Watermelon Video sites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A month after being caught smoking at a Beijing restaurant, Chinese teenage heartthrob Roy Wang (Wang Yuan) re-emerged by making a brief appearance on China Central Television&#8217;s (CCTV) flagship evening news Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the daily news program Xinwen Lianbo on Wednesday, Wang was seen singing with school children and several senior artists in another at an event featuring the route of the Long March carried out by the Chinese Workers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217; Red Army from 1934 to 1936. The event was held in Ganzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangxi Province, the starting point of the Long March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The broadcast came after he was caught smoking inside a restaurant in Beijing on May 21, which disappointed and upset many Chinese netizens who consider him a role model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang, 18, a member of the popular Chinese teen band TFBOYS and actor, was listed by Time magazine as one of the 30 most influential teenagers and appointed as a UNICEF Special Advocate for Education in 2017. He has 73 million followers on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang apologized on his Weibo account later, saying that &#8220;I deeply regret my actions, and feel very sorry for the bad social influence&#8230;I will accept responsibility and punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>After watching Xinwen Lianbo, many Net users hailed Wang&#8217;s return and showed tolerance to the young star. Some netizens on Weibo said Wang should follow the spirit of the Long March and strive to be a better public figure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not his fan. But he has apologized sincerely and paid for his carelessness. Nobody&#8217;s perfect. Overall, it is good to see Wang repair his mistake,&#8221; a Beijing-based media professional who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said that our society is tolerant and kind to outstanding youth.</p>
