<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Victoria&#8217;s Secret fashion show in New York on November 8, 2018 Photo: IC</p>
<p>It was one of the most popular fashion shows for 20 years, but US lingerie brand Victoria&#8217;s Secret is canceling its annual extravaganza amid controversy and weak financial results in the #MeToo era.</p>
<p>The decision, in the offing since the summer, reflects a shift towards brands seen as more empowering of women, such as singer Rihanna&#8217;s, and comes after several years of declining TV viewership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brand is often accused of objectifying women and has been struggling to appeal to a younger generation of lingerie shoppers who increasingly prefer simpler, less sexualized designs.</p>
<p>Victoria&#8217;s Secret has also received negative publicity surrounding its owner&#8217;s links to Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in prison this year while awaiting trial on charges he trafficked underage girls for sex.</p>
<p>The fashion show, in which models parade around with angels&#8217; wings on their backs, first aired in 1995. It was broadcast around the world, with the venue changing from year to year.</p>
<p>US viewers have declined by almost a third since 2014, from 9 million then to 3.3 million in December 2018.</p>
<p>The decision to scrap it was confirmed by Stuart Burgdoerfer, finance director of parent company L Brands, during a conference call with analysts about the brand&#8217;s latest quarterly results.</p>
<p>Victoria&#8217;s Secret once defined glamour, attracting the most sought-after supermodels like Gisele Bündchen and Naomi Campbell.</p>
<p>But Burgdoerfer added that the brand, which was the jewel in L Brands&#8217; crown for many years, had not been able to achieve a new lease on life despite recent leadership changes.</p>
<p>Its sales have been slipping in the past two years, weighing on the bottom line of L Brands which reported a net loss of $252 million in the third quarter, against a $43 million loss a year earlier.</p>
<p>Victoria&#8217;s Secret sales were just over $1 billion in the third quarter of 2019, down seven percent from the same period in 2018. More than 30 of its stores have closed since February.</p>
<p>The brand seems to be paying the price, in part, for some marketing blunders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cast in the show&#8217;s 2018 edition was more cosmopolitan than usual, following criticism that the brand had little regard for diversity in its choice of models.</p>
<p>But days after last year&#8217;s event, marketing director Ed Razek ruled out using transgender or plus-size models in future shows.</p>
<p>His ill-judged comments came as demands for greater diversity on catwalks increases. They sparked an outcry on social media and he later apologized.</p>
<p>More serious perhaps is that the brand has regularly been mentioned in news articles about disgraced hedge fund manager Epstein, who was accused of multiple sexual assaults on young women, many of them teenagers.</p>
<p>Epstein, who was arrested in July, had been close to L Brands founder Leslie Wexner. Wexner was thought to be Epstein&#8217;s biggest financial backer for a while after hiring him as a financial advisor in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Wexner said he severed ties with Epstein after the latter&#8217;s conviction for sex crimes with underage girls in 2008.</p>
<p>Moreover, countless women who accused Epstein of sexual assault said they were recruited to work for him on the false promise that he would get them jobs as Victoria&#8217;s Secret models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Models&#8217; rights group the Model Alliance hailed the show&#8217;s cancelation, noting that 100 models had signed a letter calling on Victoria&#8217;s Secret to join its &#8220;Respect&#8221; program aimed at preventing sexual assault and fostering fair working conditions.</p>
<p>With Victoria&#8217;s Secret on the slide, Rihanna is the new star of the lingerie market with her Savage X Fenty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brand is big on diversity and seeks to project an image of women as the masters of their own bodies and desires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid and Cara Delevingne paraded its lingerie at New York Fashion Week in September, signaling how popular the brand has become.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the first time on the runway that I felt really sexy,&#8221; supermodel Bella Hadid told Elle magazine.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A display at Stefano Ricci&#8217;s 2019 Fall/Winter Florence Men&#8217;s Fashion Week presentation Photo: IC</p>
<p>Italian designer Stefano Ricci&#8217;s latest silk tuxedos may be sharply tailored, but they are not ideal wear for the exceptional flood that swept through Venice as they were unveiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;For our next collection, remind me to include rain boots,&#8221; quipped creative director Filippo Ricci as he presented his father&#8217;s Fall/Winter 2021-21 collection as a record high tide left the heart of the UNESCO city underwater last week.</p>
<p>The Florence-based menswear and accessories brand, which has outfitted celebrities from Andrea Bocelli to Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise, showed off its new look at the prestigious Scuola Grande di San Rocco.</p>
<p>The Scuola&#8217;s headquarters boasts the biggest collection of paintings in the world by 16th century master Tintoretto.</p>
<p>As models showed off the collection against a backdrop of tempestuous Old Testament scenes painted in oil, canals outside burst their banks, flooding Saint Mark&#8217;s Square and Basilica, and numerous other churches and historic buildings.</p>
<p>The fashion house&#8217;s waterproof cashmere coats with mink lining may have kept those in the storm dry, but the wearer would have needed waders in any case &#8211; perhaps in the brand&#8217;s trademark nubuck crocodile.</p>
<p>Luxury label Stefano Ricci, which trains young artisans, picked the historic venue because its confraternity served as a patron of artists and artisans in its heyday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was known as a place where they were protecting and improving arts and craftmanship,&#8221; CEO Niccolo Ricci told AFP.</p>
<p>The family brand, founded in 1972, is invested in &#8220;training people in the art of beauty, [crafts that] use your hands,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Youngsters are paired with master artisans who have more than 20 years of experience in tailoring, jewelry or leather.</p>
<p>Tintoretto was placed with just such a master by his father, but legend has it painter Titian &#8211; known by his contemporaries as &#8220;The Sun Amidst Small Stars&#8221; &#8211; was afraid the youngster would outshine him, and so kicked him out.</p>
<p>Tintoretto would go on to win the commission to decorate the headquarters of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, which is dedicated to Saint Roch, invoked down the centuries by Catholics seeking protection from the plague.</p>
<p>&#8220;The confraternity was founded in around 1470 by a group of people who wanted to pray against the plague epidemics that often afflicted port cities like Venice,&#8221; said Demetrio Sonaglioni, the Scuola&#8217;s vice president.</p>
<p>&#8220;They managed to get the saint&#8217;s body from Voghera [in northern Italy]; whether they stole it or paid for it is unclear,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many came to pray to Saint Roch, many made donations, and the school became rich,&#8221; Sonaglioni said, adding that the board was made up of well-off merchants, particularly from the fabrics trade.</p>
<p>Tintoretto was painting a scene from the Old Testament about a plague of snakes sent by God when the deadly disease struck once more, killing a quarter of the city and at least 100 of the confraternity&#8217;s members.</p>
<p>His survival strengthened his faith, as can be seen in the over 60 religious depictions that adorn the walls and ceilings, including several of Saint Roch &#8211; who is also the patron saint of bachelors.</p>
<p>The blues and reds in the Stefano Ricci collection echo those in Tintoretto&#8217;s scenes. Bachelors donning the brand&#8217;s field jackets or fox fur collars are advised to steer clear of snakes, and, in particular, floods.</p>

<p>Forget stocks, real estate, even cryptocurrencies &#8212; China&#8217;s hottest investment these days is perhaps the Nike, Adidas, and Puma basketball shoes that &#8220;sneakerheads&#8221; like Hu Huaiyuan fight to get their hands on.</p>
<p>Enthusiasts worldwide have fuelled an expanding bubble in high-priced sneakers, often limited-edition collaborations between big names in sportswear and fashion, rappers or athletes.</p>
<p>But in China the craze is at fever pitch, with devotees driving soaring trading volumes on online &#8220;sneaker exchange&#8221; platforms, prompting warnings from authorities about dangerous speculation as resale profits approach 5,000 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sneaker market is no longer just a game for enthusiasts. Speculators are flocking into the business now,&#8221; said Hu, who traveled 300 kilometers (187 miles) to Shanghai for the chance to buy the latest Nike Air Jordans.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the 23-year-old&#8217;s lucky day.</p>
<p>After winning an online lottery for the right to even show up at a Nike store along with around 400 others vying for limited supplies, Hu secured the right to plonk down 1,299 yuan ($186) for a pair.</p>
<p>He plans to quickly &#8220;flip&#8221; them for double that on a bustling resale market.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I wasn&#8217;t so lucky today, it&#8217;s possible I wouldn&#8217;t be able to afford the shoes on the secondary market,&#8221; Hu said.</p>
<p>The craze&#8217;s appeal owes to two main factors.</p>
<p>NBA stars like Michael Jordan have been idolized for years in China, where basketball is arguably the most followed sport, and the associated streetwear culture finds a huge and growing market.</p>
<p>And with Chinese authorities limiting individual stock-market price movements to contain volatility, sneakers are embraced by younger investors seeking quick profits in a commodity they can relate to.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br /><strong>Excessive speculation warning</strong></span><br />
<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;If selling overpriced sneakers proves so worthwhile, why not take it as a good source of income?&#8221; said Hu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phenomenon is spurring quick growth in Chinese sneaker-trading platforms like Poizon, whose annual volume is around 15 billion yuan, according to Chinese tech consultancy iiMedia Research.</p>
<p>That is more than triple the volume of StockX, a leading US platform.</p>
<p>Platforms like Poizon and Nice also have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in investment from foreign and domestic venture capital, according to Chinese media reports.</p>
<p>The global market is taking notice. StockX&#8217;s rival GOAT launched an app-like mini-program on leading Chinese messaging platform WeChat in July. StockX executives say they also are crafting China plans.</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the central People&#8217;s Bank of China issued a warning last month about the financial risks of excessive sneaker speculation, and government-controlled media portray the phenomenon negatively.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s done little to deter people like Liu Xingfeng, a 23-year-old Chinese student at a university in Australia who collected sneakers as a hobby for years before jumping into it as a business this year.</p>
<p>He now has a loose network of people in the United States and Japan who, for a fee, apply on his behalf in online lotteries for new shoe releases, or queue outside stores.</p>
<p>Focusing on only the most sought-after models such as Air Jordans or the Adidas Yeezy, a collaboration with American rapper Kanye West, Liu estimates his monthly net profit is 50,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sneaker market hype has benefited me a lot,&#8221; said Liu.</p>
<p>But he actually avoids the Chinese&nbsp; market due to the stiff competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are too many people queuing in China. Not enough shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">&#8216;Daily necessity&#8217;</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to data-mining company iiMedia research, China&#8217;s secondary market for sneakers has passed $1 billion this year and is one of the fastest-growing components of a $6 billion global market led by the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stock market is risky and the property market is frothy, so investors are switching to speculation in the consumer sector,&#8221; said Zhang Yi, chief analyst with iiMedia Research.</p>
<p>Volumes are chugging along despite a Chinese backlash against the NBA last month, triggered when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted a message supporting Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.</p>
<p>Fear of government intervention has forced app-based platforms like Poizon and Nice to take various steps to cool excess speculation.</p>
<p>Both also employ &#8220;sneakerheads&#8221; to inspect shoes traded on their platforms are not counterfeits.</p>
<p>Nice&#8217;s Vice President Sun Qi told AFP only 0.01 percent of sneakers traded via Nice are found to be fake.</p>
<p>The commodification of sneaker culture doesn&#8217;t sit well with everyone.</p>
<p>Wang Yue, 21, considers himself a sneaker purist. His tiny Shanghai apartment is stacked to the ceiling with boxes of more than 200 pairs of sneakers that he estimates are worth hundreds of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>A basketball fanatic, sneakers are a &#8220;daily necessity&#8221; to Wang, who lavishes attention on them, including physically sucking the air out of bags containing the shoes to protect them in a sort of DIY vacuum-seal.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s soaring prices are a nuisance.&#8221;I&#8217;m really annoyed that I have to pay more for a normal pair of basketball shoes now,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Gold Traditional Bridal Dress Photo: Courtesy of Rose Studio</p>
<p>The first dress to appear at auction by the celebrated Chinese couturier, Guo Pei will be offered at Sotheby&#8217;s in its New Bond Street saleroom in London, United Kingdom, later this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a number of the first generation of trained couturiers in China, Guo shot to fame in the international stage when musician Rihanna chose to wear one of her designs to the Met Gala in 2015 &#8211; a dramatic trailing yellow gown which managed to capture the attention of the global media. Gold and Yellow have remained a signature design element of Guo&#8217;s work, colors that were previously reserved for the emperor during the Qing dynasty.</p>
<p>This exquisite piece of couture design was meticulously crafted over the course of five years and is hand sewn with gold thread in-laid with the precious metal. Carrying an estimate of $620,000-870,000, the &#8216;Gold Traditional Bridal Dress&#8217; comes to auction direct from Guo&#8217;s atelier in Beijing, presenting a rare opportunity to acquire a piece from one of the designer&#8217;s significant couture collections, normally only available for purchase when commissioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The partnership with Sotheby&#8217;s is very special for me. Sotheby&#8217;s is known for its high caliber auctions of quality antiques and masterpieces previously owned or worn by legendary individuals or part of a rare collection. Our gold traditional bridal piece selected for the auction, however, is a brand new piece of work released for the first time at an auction. It may not be an antique but it is a work of art. Its value lies in the traditional craftsmanship and culture it brings forth. I feel our partnership is an answer to Couture&#8217;s future &#8211; Couture will be considered an art form in the future and this partnership has paved the way for this possibility,&#8221; said Guo.</p>
<p>Designed as a wedding dress, the couturier employed around 30 stitching techniques adapted from across the globe to create this piece, forming a three-dimensional effect by embroidering over sheepskin, which gives the fabric different heights.</p>
<p>Auspicious clouds float across the surface of this beautiful dress, conveying harmony and embodying a significant symbol of marital bliss in Chinese culture. Gourd fruits are woven within the pattern, the word for which is phonetically similar to &#8216;Fu Lu&#8217; &#8212; a concept representing wealth and good fortune. Peonies can also be found in this piece of endearing attire, regarded by the Chinese as a important symbol of wealth, auspiciousness, happiness, and prosperity. A delicately knotted bow signifies the love of the couple to be married, entwined in utter happiness. Finally, the pattern incorporates the image of the Dragon and Phoenix &#8211; believed to be the undisputed &#8216;match made in heaven&#8217; as per Chinese culture and mythology.</p>

<p>Fashion show, Showcase of Dali, Rich Tapestry of Chinese Culture, was held during the 15th World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention (WCEC) in London on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>This marks the third time that Chinese fashion brand the Eve Group has brought traditional Chinese handicraft and the dreams of Chinese seamstresses living in rural China to London.</p>
<p>During the fashion show, models showed off 45 sets of clothing featuring the traditional embroidery elements of the Bai and Yi ethnic minority groups, while six Bai embroiderers from Dali in Southwest China&#8217;s Yunnan Province showcased their handicrafts on stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event provided the audience a taste of how the traditional culture of ethnic minorities have embraced modern elements to create a unique fashion style.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaoming, China&#8217;s ambassador to the UK, said that the event &#8220;not only showcases the integration of ethnic culture with modern fashion,&#8221; but also tells the story of Chinese enterprises that have carried forward Chinese culture, lived up to their corporate responsibilities and promoted China-UK cultural exchanges and cooperation.</p>
<p>Xia Hua, chairman of Eve Group, told the Global Times that the brand is committed to preserving and exploring traditional Chinese culture and craftsmanship, and reshaping traditional Chinese culture with an international vision.</p>
<p>After the first two events when China and the UK celebrated the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations and the China-UK high-level exchange mechanism, Eve Group wanted to continue its efforts in telling the stories of traditional Chinese handicraft culture and the ingenious culture passed down from generation to generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Embroidery Dreams Project has helped set up 1,200 workshops and 16 village museums in the provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan, Gansu and the Tibet Autonomous Region. The company has also established a database for more than 5,000 traditional embroidery patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 10 &#8220;embroidery dreams&#8221; tourism routes to the villages where this craft originated were established to show the beauty of traditional Chinese craftsmanship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pan Yuzhen, a 74-year-old Miao embroiderer from the deep mountains of Guizhou Province, said that this was her second time in London.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been to many places in the world that I never imagined I&#8217;d visit. Now my whole family lives a much better life through our embroidery skills and by our own hands,&#8221; Pan noted.</p>
<p>After 16 years, the Embroidery Dreams Project has enabled more than 10,000 seamstresses to say goodbye to poverty through their hard work.</p>
<p>Barbara Judge, who founded the B&amp;H project with Xia in 2016, told the Global Times that the past three years have been a magical experience for her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The B&amp;H project is a creative platform that allows young UK designers and traditional Chinese handicraft workers to cooperate on new concepts of fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the help and blessing of the Chinese ambassador here, we get closer and closer as nations,&#8221; Judge said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The UK and China relationship is a partnership that I hope will go on forever. And today is a very important part of that partnership.&#8221;<br />

<p>A month after being caught smoking at a Beijing restaurant, Chinese teenage heartthrob Roy Wang (Wang Yuan) re-emerged by making a brief appearance on China Central Television&#8217;s (CCTV) flagship evening news Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the daily news program Xinwen Lianbo on Wednesday, Wang was seen singing with school children and several senior artists in another at an event featuring the route of the Long March carried out by the Chinese Workers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217; Red Army from 1934 to 1936. The event was held in Ganzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangxi Province, the starting point of the Long March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The broadcast came after he was caught smoking inside a restaurant in Beijing on May 21, which disappointed and upset many Chinese netizens who consider him a role model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang, 18, a member of the popular Chinese teen band TFBOYS and actor, was listed by Time magazine as one of the 30 most influential teenagers and appointed as a UNICEF Special Advocate for Education in 2017. He has 73 million followers on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang apologized on his Weibo account later, saying that &#8220;I deeply regret my actions, and feel very sorry for the bad social influence&#8230;I will accept responsibility and punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>After watching Xinwen Lianbo, many Net users hailed Wang&#8217;s return and showed tolerance to the young star. Some netizens on Weibo said Wang should follow the spirit of the Long March and strive to be a better public figure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not his fan. But he has apologized sincerely and paid for his carelessness. Nobody&#8217;s perfect. Overall, it is good to see Wang repair his mistake,&#8221; a Beijing-based media professional who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said that our society is tolerant and kind to outstanding youth.</p>
