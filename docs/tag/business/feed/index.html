<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Xue Jun drives a bullet train. File photo: Courtesy of China Railway Corp</p>
<p><em>Railway workers at Ji&#8217;nan West High-speed Railway (HSR) Station, a key stop along the Beijing-Shanghai HSR line, share with the Global Times a personal account of the Chinese railway industry&#8217;s development during the four decades following China&#8217;s reform and opening-up in 1978. From an underdeveloped industry to a world-leading public service, the industry is developing fast and laying solid foundation for China&#8217;s economic growth. Achieving profitability only six years after its launch, the Beijing-Shanghai line is the world&#8217;s fastest railway line in commercial operation.</em></p>
<p>Rising up from a smart mattress, 51-year-old Xue Jun turns to a monitor that records the quality of his night&#8217;s sleep. </p>
<p>After the monitor produces a detailed brief on how many flops he turned during the night, his blood pressure and heartbeat, his physical readiness as a train driver is confirmed. </p>
<p>Dressed up in uniform wearing a smart captain&#8217;s hat, he waits patiently for a car to pick him up and take him to work &#8211; the cockpit of the world&#8217;s fastest bullet trains. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s how a day starts for Xue, a driver of the Fuxing electric multiple unit (EMU) trains, China&#8217;s bullet train for the New Era.</p>
<p>Different from most of his colleagues, Xue&#8217;s career started in a seemingly archaic but not so distant past.</p>
<p><strong>The driver</strong></p>
<p>In 1986, at the beginning of his career, Xue was on a mission to learn how to balance himself inside a swaying steam locomotive cabin and shovel a spade of coal in a perfect swoop so that the fuel burned evenly inside the furnace of the train&#8217;s boiler.</p>
<p>By 1994, Xue was occupied with mastering the art of electric engineering and how to work with diesel engines, as he had upgraded to become a driver for a diesel engine-powered locomotive. </p>
<p>In 2006, an electrification upgrade was successfully completed on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line. Xue soon learned how to operate an electric-powered locomotive, mastering the use of a pantograph and understanding insulation precautions to prevent injuring himself from a 270-kilovolt power line.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Xue told the Global Times that it was the pursuit of speed that got him this far. </p>
<p>When Xue obtained his license for the diesel locomotive in 1991, he thought that he was satisfied enough and that the license would be his &#8220;rice bowl for life.&#8221; And then he encountered the bullet train. </p>
<p>In 2008, Xue was driving his electric train at a speed of 160 kilometers per hour near Huangcun, a railway stop in southern Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, all of a sudden, flash and thunder! A bullet train passes by my train. In a moment&#8217;s time, all I could see was the twinkling tail light of that train. In another moment&#8217;s time, there was nothing but shimmering tracks,&#8221; Xue told the Global Times on Wednesday inside a railway depot in Ji&#8217;nan, capital of East China&#8217;s Shandong Province.</p>
<p>&#8220;Running this fast, it must feel really good,&#8221; Xue said to himself. </p>
<p>It was then that Xue made the decision to be a bullet train driver. It would take him one year, many tests, interviews, a month of training sessions and one failure before he got what he wanted. </p>
<p>In 2009, after this rigorous training, Xue finally became qualified to drive China&#8217;s bullet trains, the fastest trains in the country&#8217;s railway system. </p>
<p>&#8220;When the bullet train was first introduced, there were so many people that yearned to just have a look at these trains, not to mention taking a ride. And I was driving it,&#8221; Xue said.</p>
<p>Today, the EMU is a daily necessity for the Chinese. </p>
<p>In July and August alone, 393 million people traveled on EMUs, according to China Railway Corp.</p>
<p><strong>The station manager</strong></p>
<p>Sixty-year-old Zhao Jianjiang will retire in a few months. Zhao has spent 43 years working in China&#8217;s railway system, meaning he was in the train-related workforce even before the reform and opening-up policy was launched in 1978. </p>
<p>In Zhao&#8217;s four-decades-long career, he has taken up a wide range of posts including switch operator, inspector, dispatcher and station chief. </p>
<p>Each one of those posts is vital to the functioning of China&#8217;s railway system.</p>
<p>His first post, Zhao recalled, was at a 108-kilometer-long railway section linking Jining and Hezhe, two cities in Shandong. Against the norm of China, that railway was not operated by the State-owned railway operator, but by the Shandong provincial government. </p>
<p>The line was incorporated under the wings of the State railway in 1996, the year the north-south artery of the Beijing-Kowloon line opened. </p>
<p>&#8220;When I began working as a young man, I was assigned to manage the switch, which allowed the train to change lines, and I had to pull the manual gear with all my strength and use a kerosene lamp to signal the train,&#8221; Zhao said. </p>
<p>&#8220;Then, the switch was upgraded, still requiring manual work but powered by electricity. And since then, no one has ever had to manage the switch in such way. Line changes are now dictated by a control center at a railway operator information hub,&#8221; Zhao said, noting the evolution from decentralization to centralization.</p>
<p>And there were uniforms, too, he said. In the 1980s, station staff members were given what is called a &#8220;Lenin coat&#8221; &#8211;&nbsp; measured using sizes 1 to 9 like those in the military. </p>
<p>&#8220;We often ended up being dressed in too large a coat, and looked sloppy in it. Our uniforms are tailor-made today, so that when we are in service, we look sharp,&#8221; Zhao said. </p>
<p><strong>The future</p>
<p></strong>Speaking about his vision for the future of China&#8217;s railway industry, Xue did not seem too excited about the news of a 1,000-kilometer-an-hour super-high-speed train. &#8220;Speed itself should not be mistaken as the goal; we pursue speed, because it is backed by demand.&#8221; </p>
<p>He noted that the lifting of speed would in turn increase the cost of operation, both in terms of electricity supply and extra work to ensure safety, which would rise significantly and sometimes disproportionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see in the future the full-scale completion of China&#8217;s HSR network across the country and the full-scale deployment of China&#8217;s Fuxing EMU,&#8221; Xue said.</p>
<p>Zhao said the future of transportation will be marked by the integration of HSR railway networks with expressways and subways. </p>
<p>Due to Ji&#8217;nan&#8217;s complex underground water table, the city&#8217;s subway development has for years lagged behind others, but a new subway line is finally being constructed to link Ji&#8217;nan West HSR Station with the city&#8217;s center, streamlining the journey from home to the station.</p>
<p>Li Yang, a staff member working at Ji&#8217;nan West HSR Station, said there were only 86 high-speed train services a day when the station opened in 2011, but now the number is approaching 333. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, passengers have grown more than 13 times from 3,000 a day to 40,000 a day. </p>
<p>&#8220;And our province will soon add a new HSR between Ji&#8217;nan and Qingdao. If a train could run at 200 kilometers per hour, it could be considered a high-speed train in many countries and regions. But we want trains running at a speed of 350 kilometers on the Ji&#8217;nan-Qingdao HSR, as locals feel that if they were slower, it would strangle the development of the province.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Wenzhou&#8217;s electric appliance sector had been developing rapidly in the wake of China&#8217;s reform and opening-up policy, which stimulated massive market demand. But as time went by, the sector, like other manufacturing industries in Wenzhou, faced a crossroads, as traditional advantages like cheap labor dwindled and market overproduction weeded out small companies. Experts warn that some Wenzhou merchants don&#8217;t have innovative mind-sets, which are the only way to preserve local manufacturing glory.</em> </p>
<p>During the last 40 years of reform and opening-up, Wenzhou of East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province has won itself a good reputation for small commodity manufacturing &#8211; whether it be electronics, shoes, clothes or other products. </p>
<p>In particular, manufacturing of electric appliances and related components has been a mushrooming and popular industry in Wenzhou. However, the industry, like other manufacturing sectors, is currently undergoing some restructuring. </p>
<p>On July 10, the Global Times visited the electric hardware market located in Wenzhou, which is lined with small shops selling products ranging from electric components such as wires and appliances like fans, to bath heaters and electric switches. </p>
<p>At about 3:00 pm, few customers could be seen at the market. </p>
<p>A seller of electric wires, who only gave his surname as Zheng, told the Global Times that Wenzhou&#8217;s electric appliance industry experienced some downturn several years ago, but over the past two years, it has recovered a little as a result of rising urban reconstruction in the city.</p>
<p>But it was during the 1980s when the local electric appliance industry experienced its initial boom, going through a period of rapid development as market opportunities sprang up along with the economic reform and opening-up policy. </p>
<p><strong>Taking advantage</strong></p>
<p>Hu Jinlin, a native of Liushi town under Yueqing, a county-level city in Wenzhou and also a pioneer in the Wenzhou&#8217;s electric appliance industry, said that many of Wenzhou&#8217;s electric appliance tycoons originally started off as metal component sellers and then went on to become electric appliance salespeople.</p>
<p>Hu himself also went on this course. According to him, at the beginning of the reform and opening-up policy in 1978, Wenzhou&#8217;s economy started to speed up, with many private companies shortly needing to purchase small metal tools like screws due to rising demand.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, most tools were sold via a materials company in Yueqing. But the company would only sell products to State-owned companies and cared little about private ones. That gave me and my brother a chance to buy small components from other places like Taishun [a county under Wenzhou about 180 kilometers away from Yueqing] and sell them at a higher price to local customers,&#8221; he told the Global Times. </p>
<p>In the 1980s, he started to shift his business focus to selling electric appliances, soon witnessing the rise of the industry in Yueqing. </p>
<p>According to Hu, the market changes at the time of the launch of the reform policy provided lots of opportunities to businesspeople like him. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the early 1980s, the country was undergoing a transition from a planned economy to a market-driven economy,&#8221; Hu said. </p>
<p>During the process, he said he gained lots of experience and earned a big fortune, especially because merchants like him knew how to woo customers better and truly understand what they really wanted in the new market-driven economy compared to State-owned firms. </p>
<p>According to Hu, his sales revenues amounted to more than 1 million yuan in 1981, which equaled to about $1.7 million at the time.</p>
<p>Like Hu, many Wenzhou merchants grasped opportunities during early years of the reform and opening-up, which in turn caused the local electric appliance industry to flourish. According to a report released by zj.qq.com in June 2014, by the end of 1980, there were 238 electric appliance and electric component companies as well as nearly 1,000 households doing jobs related to the industry in Liushi town alone. </p>
<p><strong>Industrial upgrading</strong></p>
<p>According to Hu, Wenzhou&#8217;s electric appliance industry continued to flourish and reached a climax around 2000. But even at that time, Hu sensed that the sector was sure to face production-related problems in the years to come, as too many players jumped into the industry. </p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, big tycoons in the sector are still operating well in Wenzhou, but small companies in the sector are having a difficult time &#8211; many have had to close down. I guess that in the future, there will only be five to six companies in the sector whose production rates can meet all the market needs, both at home and abroad,&#8221; Hu told the Global Times. </p>
<p>At the moment, big electric appliance firms in Wenzhou include Chint and China Delixi. </p>
<p>Like the electric appliance sector, other local manufacturing sectors are facing pressure to upgrade, which is tough for many Wenzhou businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wenzhou&#8217;s manufacturing flourished for a number of years after the reform and opening-up policy began, for reasons such as low labor costs, a relatively flexible local management environment and a good labor division system. But those advantages are gradually losing their power as they don&#8217;t have a high threshold and their strategies can easily be learned by other cities,&#8221; Ye Hang, a professor with the College of Economics at Zhejiang University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. </p>
<p>According to Ye, when profitability in traditional cheap labor manufacturing shrinks, local manufacturers, as they have for some time, shift to money-sourcing businesses like developing gold mines or coal mines. </p>
<p>&#8220;This also demonstrates Wenzhou businesspeople&#8217;s shortcomings when it comes to having business-oriented mind-sets &#8211; they prefer ventures in highly profitable industries instead of spending time and money in technical research,&#8221; Ye said. </p>
<p>However, Ye also said that for Wenzhou&#8217;s manufacturing sector, the solution is still to upgrade technologies by increasing input into research and development. &#8220;The traditional model is by no means sustainable,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Zhang Yili, a professor with the School of Business at Wenzhou University, said that the city&#8217;s traditional manufacturing has also been trying to shift toward high-tech industries like electric cars in recent years, but there have been no evident results thus far. </p>
<p>Wenzhou published guidelines in 2017 that noted how the city would push the upgrading of 10 manufacturing sectors, including electric appliances, shoes, clothing and toys. The guidelines also noted that the city&#8217;s traditional manufacturing sector should evidently upgrade its industrial structure and enhance innovation by the end of 2020. </p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Wenzhou businessman Hu Jinlin Photo: Xie Jun/GT</p>
<p><em>Merchants from Wenzhou, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province are known for their talents in doing business. Many of them have grasped opportunities created by China&#8217;s reform and opening-up policy to make ventures. The Global Times recently interviewed Hu Jinlin, a Wenzhou businessman nicknamed the &#8220;electric appliance king,&#8221; to talk about his business ups and downs during the 40 years of reform and opening-up.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 40-year history of reform and opening-up, merchants from Wenzhou, a city of less than 12,000 square kilometers located in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, have caught China&#8217;s and even the world&#8217;s attention for their brilliant business minds, pioneering spirits and successes in building the powers of Chinese companies. </p>
<p>&#8220;Wenzhou had a large population but little land&#8230; We had to mainly count on ourselves. We were not like big city graduates who had their jobs arranged so they could feed themselves. We had to go with the times and adapt to society,&#8221; Wenzhou businessman Hu Jinlin told the Global Times. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, he flew back to Phnom Penh, capital of Cambodia, where he now lives and works. For Hu, he cherishes memories of his business heydays in Wenzhou, where he was a pioneer of the local hardware and electrical appliances industry, but he knows those days are gone. </p>
<p><strong>Pressured into business</p>
<p></strong>Zhang Yili, a professor with the School of Business at Wenzhou University, echoed Hu&#8217;s views in saying that the success of Wenzhou merchants is the result of a harsh reality. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tradition that Wenzhou farmers would often do business in the slack season. If they didn&#8217;t do so, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to make a living,&#8221; Zhang told the Global Times. </p>
<p>In some way, Hu is a typical example of a generation that was forced to stand up on its own. </p>
<p>Born into a big family of 8 brothers, Hu in 1974 followed a relative to Central China&#8217;s Hubei Province to work, just one year after he graduated from junior high school.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were taken to the mountainous area, which is now the Shennongjia region in Hubei, to build a radar station. I still remember the mountain roads &#8211; they were so rough! When we arrived, I immediately requested to go back to my hometown,&#8221; Hu said. </p>
<p>&#8220;But that trip made me realize that China is very vast, and it inspired me to do business for a living,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>After returning to Yueqing, his hometown, in 1976, Hu started his hardware business.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I started the business, I often spent whole days sitting at my booth, while many of my peers talked about where to hang out. But I knew that when doing business, a very important thing was that the customers could find sellers whenever they wanted.&#8221; </p>
<p>With the market economy budding in China, Hu&#8217;s business also flourished locally. </p>
<p>&#8220;By the end of October 1976, I had already managed to build a house of my own. By the end of that year, I had about 50,000 yuan in cash,&#8221; Hu said. But that was a rare case, as many people at that time only earned dozens of yuan in monthly salaries. It was, therefore, a dream to earn a yearly income of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Back in the 1970s, the Chinese currency was not as depreciated as it is now, with its value standing at about 1.5 yuan per dollar. </p>
<p>In the 1980s, Hu shifted his business focus to selling electric appliances, and it was a success. Later, he was nicknamed the &#8220;king of electric appliances&#8221; in Wenzhou, becoming one of the eight local business kings. </p>
<p>The other seven ran businesses related to making catalogues and molding. </p>
<p>Driven by energetic and aggressive Wenzhou merchants, the city&#8217;s GDP surged from about 1.32 billion yuan in 1978 to 550 billion yuan ($82.4 billion) in 2017, according to media reports.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Undertows in reform</strong> </p>
<p>For Wenzhou merchants, however, doing business 30-40 years ago was not always rainbows and unicorns. In reality, they had their own hurdles to jump along the bumpy road of reform and opening-up. </p>
<p>In the early 1980s, a wave of anti-speculation swept across China, and Wenzhou businesspeople were not safe from it. </p>
<p>Speculation at the time referred to buying products at low prices and selling them at higher prices.</p>
<p>Due to that campaign, 164,000 economic crime cases were investigated across the country, resulting in the sentencing of 30,000 people, Chengdu-based newspaper West China City Daily reported in May. </p>
<p>According to Hu, the central government in 1982 sent some officials to Zhejiang&#8217;s Yueqing county where talks were to be held. </p>
<p>After the talks, Hu sensed that danger was on the horizon. A few days later, he made some false certificates, hired a boat and fled Yueqing. </p>
<p>Being a fugitive, Hu wandered from Wenzhou to Shanghai and eventually up to North China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But Hu said that he was never desperate, as he believed the trend of China&#8217;s marketization was irreversible despite temporary setbacks. </p>
<p>Hu, along with the other seven Wenzhou business kings, was put into prison around 1982 on speculation charges. </p>
<p>But the local government later dropped the charges against them and championed them as reform pioneers, in accordance with the central government&#8217;s reform and opening-up policy, according to the report. </p>
<p>In 1984, Hu eventually returned to Yueqing and continued his business in his hometown.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Going global</strong> </p>
<p>In 2000, after hearing a speech by then Chinese premier Zhu Rongji about the proposal of a free trade zone between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a>), Hu studied the 10 ASEAN countries and picked Cambodia to develop his business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cambodia is like a pool in a forest with big fish and deep water. The question is how can you catch the fish,&#8221; Hu noted, adding that on average, electric appliances in Cambodia were four or five times more expensive than those sold in China, which made room for business. </p>
<p>In July 2001, he opened his electric appliance company in Cambodia, which is still operating today. Now, the domestic market only accounts for a very small portion of Hu&#8217;s business, while the overseas markets are his core focus. </p>
<p>According to a report released by Wenzhou-based news website 66wz.com in June 2017, about 680,000 fellow Chinese from Wenzhou are living abroad, accounting for one-third of all Zhejiang natives living overseas. </p>
<p>In 2017, 16.3 percent of the Zhejiang population was living in Wenzhou, according to media reports.</p>
<p>Zhang said that a common trait of Wenzhou merchants is that they dare to go out of their comfort zone. </p>
<p>&#8220;They like to source information from here and there, and to research far-away markets,&#8221; Zhang said. </p>

<p><em>Thanks to China&#8217;s economic reform and opening-up over the last four decades, more and more people are now able to afford to travel by airplane, especially as travel demand increased and as routes became more internationalized. Global Times reporter Zhang Hongpei recently paid a visit to Xiamen Airlines and Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport, both of which were considered reform pioneers in the 1980s, not only in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone, but also in China&#8217;s aviation industry at large. This is the last part of a five-part story.</em></p>
<p>After welcoming its first Boeing 737 MAX as its 200th member of its ever-growing fleet and successfully completing the aircraft&#8217;s maiden flight in May, Xiamen Airlines is stepping up efforts to launch more flights to countries and regions along the routes of the China-proposed <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative%20News%20Desk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> (B&amp;R) initiative.</p>
<p>Founded in 1984 in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone (SEZ), East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, Xiamen Airlines has grown rapidly with the city while riding the boom of China&#8217;s reform and opening-up policy, greatly driving the country&#8217;s economic development and enhancing people&#8217;s living standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the mid-1990s, China&#8217;s aviation industry entered an ever-evolving growth period that saw more Chinese-owned aircraft, while the supply and demand relationship gradually changed,&#8221; said Che Shanglun, chairman of Xiamen Airlines.</p>
<p>During the first decade after Xiamen Airlines was founded, there was only one ticket office and flight tickets back then were mainly for business officials, with only a tiny portion issued to members of the general public, Che told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, civil aircraft have become very popular and convenient transport vehicles. The previous passenger profile was predominantly middle-aged men. But that has changed to all ages and genders now, with passengers traveling for purposes as diverse as business trips, leisure and family visits. Plus, tickets can now be bought on online platforms instead of at physical ticket windows,&#8221; Che noted.</p>
<p>During the past five years, the annual growth rate of Xiamen Airlines&#8217; passenger capacity hit 15 percent. By contrast, the figure stood at 4 percent for US civil aviation, 6 percent for Europe and 10 percent for the rest of China, according to a report released by industry website carnoc.com in May.</p>
<p>In 1987, Xiamen Airlines made profits for the first time with a total passenger traffic volume of 320,000. Thirty years later in 2017, the figure surged to 32 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;The civil aviation industry can largely boost the local economy and drive economic transformation. Meanwhile, it can benefit a lot from growing trends,&#8221; Che noted.</p>
<p>In 2017, Xiamen Airlines was profitable for the 31st straight year, becoming the only Chinese airline to keep such a consecutive record, according to a document the company sent to the Global Times.</p>
<p><strong>Innovator </p>
<p></strong>Xiamen Airlines was the first airline in China to operate under the modern enterprise system, embarking on a journey in the country&#8217;s new market-driven aviation industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Xiamen Airlines, which then was owned by both the Fujian provincial government and the Civil Aviation Administration of China, was the first to propose a joint equity enterprise model, ushering in the new reform era, although the initial period did witness many difficulties due to a lack of experience and funds,&#8221; Che explained.</p>
<p>At present, the airline is jointly owned by China Southern Airlines with a 55 percent stake, Xiamen Construction and Development Group with 34 percent, and Fujian Investment and Development Group with 11 percent.</p>
<p>When the company first started, there were only seven employees. And when the company opened its first domestic air route from Xiamen to Guangzhou, capital of South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, in 1985, there were only five flights per week, according to Che. </p>
<p>&#8220;I still remember the boarding cards at the time were handwritten and the facilities onboard were also poor, as there was no oven or dining cart. Only cold food was provided on a plate,&#8221; Che recalled.</p>
<p>The airline currently operates over 600 domestic and international flights per day. Its current amount of international routes stands at 72 and it also operates a strong network of flights departing from China to Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, Europe, North America and Australia. </p>
<p>Also, as of May, the airline had transported a total of one million passengers via its intercontinental routes, data from Xiamen Airlines showed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re planning to launch more flights to act as an air bridge to countries and regions along the B&amp;R routes, strengthening trade and personnel exchanges,&#8221; Che stressed.</p>
<p><strong>A helping hand</strong></p>
<p>In addition to air transport services, the construction standards of airports also play a significant role in bolstering China&#8217;s economic development.</p>
<p>Liang Zhigang, chief financial officer of Xiamen Iport Group, the owner and operator of Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport, told the Global Times in a recent interview that the airport&#8217;s initial construction in 1982 was met with many difficulties, mainly in relation to tightened finances at that time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fujian&#8217;s transport was quite inconvenient at the start of the 1980s. Motivated by the reform and opening-up policy, the province needed an airport in the Xiamen SEZ to improve its infrastructure and attract passenger flow. The first problem was money,&#8221; Liang recalled.</p>
<p>At that time, the provincial government&#8217;s financial revenue could not cover all the airport&#8217;s initial investment worth about 96 million yuan ($14.55 million), Liang noted. </p>
<p>As such, the Xiamen government tried its best and finally succeeded in borrowing from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, Kuwait&#8217;s agency for the provision of financial and technical assistance to developing countries. </p>
<p>At the time, Kuwait was also seeking to invest in developing countries, thus making Xiamen airport the first airport in China to be built with the help of foreign loans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, the Kuwait fund, worth nearly half of the total investment, helped us solve the pressing capital problem,&#8221; Liang noted. </p>
<p>The construction of Xiamen airport took only 22 months, the speed of which was the epitome of &#8220;Xiamen speed&#8221; at the time, he said proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the first batch of loans, the Kuwait fund then lent us more capital for the airport&#8217;s second-phase expansion from 1992 to 1996, when the Xiamen government decided not to provide funds but rather push the project toward a market-oriented path,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In order to find the necessary funds, the airport adopted various methods including commercial bank loans, corporate bonds as well as other financing sources.</p>
<p>Amid a trend in 1996 whereby State-owned enterprises were encouraged to get listed, Xiamen Iport Group issued its stock on the Shanghai Stock Exchange with the code &#8220;Xiamen Airport,&#8221; becoming the first stock in Chinese civil aviation history. This also created another source of capital at the time, according to Liang.</p>
<p>At the moment, Xiamen Iport Group is rolling out plans to build a new airport in Xiamen&#8217;s Xiang&#8217;an district by 2022, since Gaoqi airport has reached the point of saturation, Liang said, adding its throughput hit 24.48 million in 2017.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the Xiamen SEZ, airports play the role of an engine and can greatly drive local revenue and employment via its throughput,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p><em>Pilot free trade zones (FTZs) have become key agents in promoting and bolstering China&#8217;s reform and opening-up policy. As the country further deepens its reform and boosts innovation in its coastal FTZs, the China (Fujian) Pilot FTZ is now ready to navigate more toward the routes of the 21st Century Maritime <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/ReportsfromtheSilkRoad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silk Road</a>, the maritime part of the China-proposed <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative%20News%20Desk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> (B&amp;R) initiative. Global Times reporters Li Xuanmin and Zhang Hongpei recently visited to the China (Fujian) Pilot FTZ to investigate how the zone has developed to help implement the initiative and drive further opening-up. This is the fourth part of a five-part story.</em></p>
<p>East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, the starting point of the ancient maritime Silk Road, is stepping up its efforts to deepen economic cooperation with Taiwan and to accelerate further development at the core zone of the Maritime Silk Road, the maritime part of the China-proposed Belt and Road (B&amp;R) initiative.</p>
<p>Li Faming, director of the management committee of the Fuzhou Area of the China (Fujian) Pilot FTZ, told the Global Times in a recent interview that the Maritime Silk Road has prompted Fujian to better connect with countries and regions along the routes and to accelerate the expansion of local enterprises in overseas markets.</p>
<p>Hongdong Fishery Co, based in Fuzhou, Fujian&#8217;s provincial capital, is a company that is riding the boom of the Maritime Silk Road.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Go out&#8217;</p>
<p></strong>In 2010, the fishery company signed a 50-year contract to build a large-scale fishery base in the Western African country of Mauritania with an investment of $300 million. The base, which includes a complete industry chain from processing to refrigeration and production, has created 2,000 job opportunities for locals and helped the nation develop an infrastructure network. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the 1990s, when we were trying to &#8216;go out&#8217; and expand our business, there were many barriers due to distrust, but now countries along the routes of the B&amp;R initiative like Mauritania are willing to cooperate with us, because they know projects along the routes could bring mutual benefits,&#8221; Chen Zhongjie, board secretary of the fishery company, told the Global Times. </p>
<p>Chen noted that Hongdong&#8217;s investment focuses on long-term, sustainable growth, while companies in Europe mostly adopt the strategy of &#8220;coming, catching fish and leaving.&#8221; </p>
<p>The project also elevates the value of local fish resources because the company, through processing, has begun to supply fish as food to human beings rather than as fodder for animals. </p>
<p>The B&amp;R initiative also provides a platform for China and other countries and regions along the routes to communicate, spot business opportunities and discover local demands, Chen added. </p>
<p>For example, to facilitate cross-border fish trading in countries and regions along the B&amp;R routes, authorities in Fuzhou have also set up the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1060150.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China-</a><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a> Marine Product Exchange within the Fuzhou Area of the China (Fujian) Pilot FTZ. The exchange, with standard pricing mechanisms, had attracted 358 fishery companies and 2,187 dealers from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan as well as ASEAN countries as of February 2017. </p>
<p>In addition to Hongdong Fishery, other Fuzhou companies such as battery-maker SCUD and Wanquan Logistics have also set up branches in Singapore under the initiative, according to Li.</p>
<p>The Maritime Silk Road Mall, located inside the Fuzhou Area of the China (Fujian) Pilot FTZ, is another example of how Fuzhou is facilitating trade via its well-developed transportation network and importing products from countries along the Maritime Silk Road to diversify the Chinese mainland market.</p>
<p>The mall, designed for wholesale transactions, has attracted enterprises from more than 40 countries and regions along the Maritime Silk Road, including Thailand, Malaysia, Spain and Indonesia, which helped to set up exhibition halls there. </p>
<p>A salesperson surnamed Li at the Thailand Exhibition Center told the Global Times that Thai sauces such as sweet chili and fish have been &#8220;selling quite well&#8221; in the market. </p>
<p>&#8220;Many clients visit the exhibition center and then place orders, which is a great way to lift up sales,&#8221; Li said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fujian is a key part of the Maritime Silk Road, and we&#8217;re taking advantage of the province&#8217;s geographic location, as well as a number of preferential policies issued by the local government,&#8221; said Chen.</p>
<p>According to Li, maritime, inland and air routes have been opened to connect Fujian with European countries. </p>
<p>For example, in 2017, the railway routes that link Fuzhou with Europe via Manzhouli in North China&#8217;s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been put into trial operation.</p>
<p><strong>Silk Road by land</strong></p>
<p>China&#8217;s freight train service, officially known as the China Railway Express, is an important part of the B&amp;R initiative.</p>
<p>Xiamen, a key port city in Fujian Province as well as a strategic pivot spot along the Maritime Silk Road, has opened six international lines to Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>As of May, the China-Asia/Europe freight train starting from Xiamen had operated 316 trips, with its commodity value reaching 5.16 billion yuan ($793 million), data from the Xiamen Area of the China (Fujian) Pilot FTZ showed.</p>
<p>Lin Zhenya, director of the Economic Development Bureau of the Xiamen Area of the China (Fujian) Pilot FTZ, told the Global Times that Xiamen is a natural pivotal junction for the Maritime Silk Road and Silk Road Economic Belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through rail-sea intermodal transport, we want to transform Xiamen into a new national logistics passageway, radiating toward ASEAN countries as well as the Taiwan region,&#8221; Lin said.</p>
<p>The first China-Europe freight train to depart from one of China&#8217;s FTZs left Xiamen in 2015 and carried electronic goods made by Taiwan-headquartered Admiral Oversea Corp to Lodz, Poland. </p>
<p>Xiamen and its surrounding cities are export-oriented, boasting clothes and shoemaking industries, machinery equipment and handicraft, Lin noted, adding that the port city is also ramping up efforts to import more goods from the countries and regions along the B&amp;R routes, including auto parallel imports from Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Russian version of the Land Rover is likely to ride on the Xiamen-Moscow freight train and arrive in China [in the future], while the current imports from Russia are mainly wood and paper pulp,&#8221; said Ou Xiaping, port service manager of Xiamen C&amp;D Bonded Logistics Co, the operator of the Xiamen-Moscow line that first set off in 2017.</p>
<p>At the moment, the train departs from the Xiamen Area of the China (Fujian) Pilot FTZ every Sunday and takes about 14 days to arrive in Moscow. &#8220;Since May, we have added one or two trips per month to meet Russian market demand amid the FIFA World Cup,&#8221; Ou said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goods related to the World Cup, like sneakers, sportswear and backpacks, have seen an obvious increase in demand recently,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Wang Xiu, vice general manager of Xiamen C&amp;D Bonded Logistics Co, believes that the Russian market is set to embrace more growth in the future based on the good ties between China and Russia as well as Russia&#8217;s recovery from US sanctions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Orders placed by Russian customers have witnessed obvious increase over the past few years,&#8221; Wang noted.</p>
<p>In 2017, the total trade volume between China and Russia via Xiamen port reached 8.68 billion yuan, up 32.2 percent year-on-year, data from Xiamen&#8217;s customs bureau showed. </p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Gong Xiong (right) has a photo taken with a visitor in an art gallery filled with paintings depicting China&#8217;s reform and opening-up, in Fuzhou, capital of East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, on June 15.

<p><em>The past four decades have seen a drastic shift in China&#8217;s economic system, from a planned economy to a diversified and vibrant market-oriented economy, a result of the country&#8217;s reform and opening-up policy that was announced by the central government in 1978. Significant reform of a State-owned enterprise (SOE) in Fuzhou, capital of East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, has played a vital role in breaking the shackles imposed by a planned economy. Global Times reporter Li Xuanmin recently paid a visit to Fuzhou to interview the initiator of the country&#8217;s very first SOE reform. This is the third part of a five-part story.</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For Gong Xiong, former director of State-owned Fuzhou Pencil Factory (FPF), nothing he achieved in his life could have had such a far-reaching, nationwide impact than the State-owned enterprise (SOE) reform he initiated in 1983. </p>
<p>Back then, Gong signed a responsibility certificate with the Fuzhou city government, pledging to a very high profit goal in exchange for independent production and management rights from the local authorities. That moment sparked the start of the very first SOE reform in China. </p>
<p>In 1984, Gong exceeded the target after implementing sweeping reforms at FPF. In the 2000s, the factory was merged with other small and medium-sized SOEs. </p>
<p>Inspired by his success, 54 other managers of SOEs in Fuzhou, capital of East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, wrote and signed a letter along with Gong in the March of that year to the provincial government, urging authorities to &#8220;loosen supervision of SOEs and to delegate decisions on rights to enterprises.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter of appeal caused an immediate storm across the country. And two months later, the State Council, the country&#8217;s cabinet, issued a regulation that expanded the independent rights of SOEs in response to the letter. And later on that year, the country also began promoting the &#8220;holding project managers to account&#8221; system. </p>
<p>From then on, China&#8217;s economic system embarked on a 40-year reform, gradually shifting from a planned economy to a vigorous market-oriented economy.</p>
<p>Gong, a clear-sighted man now in his 70s and a witness to the transformation of China&#8217;s economic system, is still able to quickly pinpoint how exactly the first SOE reform was carried out back in the early 1980s and to describe in detail its significance to the country&#8217;s further opening-up journey.</p>
<p><strong>Operating at a loss</strong></p>
<p>Back in the early 1980s, almost all SOEs in China were operating with losses, including FPF. </p>
<p>The key reason behind this is the &#8220;highly centralized old economic system&#8221; whereby every detail involving the operation and management of SOEs had to follow orders from the government, Gong said. </p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, we were an accessory to the government. The factory director was appointed by the local authorities, and so were the senior managers. Even building a toilet needed approval from the top,&#8221; Gong explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, the government made the production plan for us and gave us raw materials and funds, yet local authorities barely had any idea of how a pencil was produced and sold,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Furthermore, workers at SOEs were made to be equalitarian, and there was no difference in appreciation for less or more work, resulting in a slack working environment where employees often disobeyed orders, he added. </p>
<p>Feeling the urgent need for reform, Gong took a bold move in 1983 and submitted a duty pledge letter to the Fujian provincial government, saying that if he failed to deliver a promise, he would resign from his position. </p>
<p>In the letter, Gong specified a profit goal of 1 million ($152,447) to 2 million yuan within one year, considered very high at a time when the average monthly salary for ordinary factory workers in China was just 20 ($3) to 30 yuan. </p>
<p>In return, Gong asked for independent operation and management rights, financing governing rights and personnel administration rights, a milestone moment in breaking free from the planned economic system. </p>
<p><strong>Trailblazer</strong> </p>
<p>The Fujian government approved Gong&#8217;s request in 1983, heralding the start of China&#8217;s very first SOE reform. </p>
<p>Recalling the reform, Gong still remembers in detail one of the first measures he took. He abandoned the factory&#8217;s system of &#8220;indiscriminate egalitarianism&#8221; and implemented a new system of &#8220;payment based on one&#8217;s work,&#8221; which rewarded employees who had worked overtime with bonuses.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He stood up to immense pressure and innovatively established a workers recruitment and management mechanism. Under the new mechanism, employees who violated working rules would be disciplined or even be fired.</p>
<p>&#8220;To further boost sales, we also studied the market, and dedicatedly and colorfully packed our products to draw the attention of children,&#8221; said Wang Wenrong, then deputy director of FPF.</p>
<p>Those moves, although seen as common practices today, were quite innovative at that time and in turn &#8220;largely mobilized employees&#8217; enthusiasm for working and raised their incomes,&#8221; Wang remarked.</p>
<p>As a result, in 1984, Gong handed in an annual report that far exceeded everyone&#8217;s expectations. </p>
<p>&#8220;We not only rejuvenated the factory and turned losses into profits, but also exported our products to foreign countries and regions. The pencils were welcomed in overseas markets, bringing huge amounts of foreign exchanges to the country in the 1980s,&#8221; Wang noted.</p>
<p><strong>Wide impact</strong></p>
<p>The successful reform at FPF eased authorities&#8217; concerns over a market-oriented economy. This then encouraged the central government to delegate decisions on rights to local enterprises later in 1984. And since then, a wave of SOE reforms has reached more companies in Fujian and in other provinces. </p>
<p>By 1989, the revenues of SOEs in Fujian had climbed rapidly, with the average annual growth rate of the province&#8217;s industrial output increasing five times that posted in 1984, according to a 2016 report by the Fujian Daily newspaper. And in the 1990s, Fuzhou ranked as the 8th most economically strong provincial capital in the country. </p>
<p>By 2017, revenues of non-financial SOEs in Fujian had expanded 31 percent year-on-year to 1.22 trillion yuan, with major economic indicators standing higher than the national average of SOEs.</p>
<p>Feng Liguo, deputy director of the China Center for Strategy and Policy Research under the Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Monday that the revolution at FPF is significant in terms of both its influence on Fujian&#8217;s economy and in promoting broader economic system reform nationwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fair to say that without the reform, China would still be locked in a prolonged planned economy period, unable to achieve its economic miracle in the past 40 years,&#8221; Gong said. </p>
<p>&#8220;And the country would be subject to the burdens and debts of small and medium-sized SOEs, which would have gone bankrupt when foreign companies swarmed into the Chinese market in the 1990s,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Feng stressed that the SOE revolution dating back to 1983 provides insight into how the government should properly handle the operation of SOEs today and ensure that the market plays a decisive role in tackling new challenges such as economic downturn pressure and supply-side structural reform.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;drawing on FPF&#8217;s experience, the central government should now take innovative measures to relax limits on private capital investment in areas such as military projects and petroleum production, which have both been monopolized by SOEs,&#8221; Feng said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have played a significant role in the reform and opening-up of China&#8217;s financial sector over the past four decades. </p>
<p>In particular, the Xiamen SEZ in East China&#8217;s Fujian Province has been taking the lead among the country&#8217;s five SEZs, by setting up China&#8217;s first joint venture (JV) bank &#8211; Xiamen International Bank (XIB) &#8211; in 1985.</p>
<p>That same year, the five SEZs, namely Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou, all in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, South China&#8217;s Hainan Island as well as Xiamen, became open to foreign banks.</p>
<p>Coincidentally established in that same year when economic reform, opening-up and financial system innovation were called on, XIB was positioned as the &#8220;test ground&#8221; for China&#8217;s financial reform, said Huang Daqing, vice president of XIB.</p>
<p>Xiamen, a notable hometown for overseas Chinese, soon began attracting investment from Chinese residing in Southeast Asia, China&#8217;s Hong Kong and the island of Taiwan during the initial period of reform and opening-up, Huang told the Global Times in an exclusive interview on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;But only a few domestic banks were able to provide specialized services to these enterprises at that time, while the branches of foreign banks in China were even fewer,&#8221; Huang recalled.</p>
<p>&#8220;As more and more foreign capital began gradually entering the Chinese mainland, they badly needed a bank to provide support to financial services similar to what they enjoyed in their home markets,&#8221; noted Huang, adding that State-owned banks took the majority of stakes in the domestic financial sector at that time. </p>
<p>&#8220;No market-driven and competition mechanism existed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bringing in more overseas funds to boost Xiamen&#8217;s economic development was also a key target for the local government, since the city&#8217;s GDP was small at the start of reform and opening-up, he added. </p>
<p>In 2017, Xiamen&#8217;s GDP registered 435.12 billion yuan ($66.8 billion), up 7.6 percent year-on-year, data from the city&#8217;s statistics bureau showed in January. By contrast, the figure in 1980 was just 640 million yuan, according to media reports.</p>
<p>In the financial services sector, the Xiamen SEZ had 44 banking institutions, 153 securities companies and 38 insurance companies by the end of 2017. Meanwhile, the sector&#8217;s value reached 49.1 billion yuan in 2017, accounting for 11.3 percent of Xiamen&#8217;s total GDP, domestic industry site financialnews.com.cn reported.</p>
<p>Back in 1980, Xiamen had merely five banks and one insurance company, with the value of the financial sector standing at 9.1 million yuan, comprising 1.4 percent of that year&#8217;s GDP, according to the report.</p>
<p>Keeping up with the development of Xiamen&#8217;s SEZ, the city&#8217;s financial sector has also experienced robust growth, from small to big, from single to diverse and from low-level to high-level, Li Weiping, head of the Xiamen branch of the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBC), was quoted as saying in the report. The PBC is the country&#8217;s central bank.</p>
<p><strong>Strong innovation</strong> </p>
<p>As the first JV bank in China, the XIB pioneered in reforming and improving Xiamen&#8217;s financial services concept and standards, thus attracting more foreign capital to the coastal city. </p>
<p>These moves have greatly boosted local economic development, enhanced the city&#8217;s investment environment and strengthened the confidence of foreign investors, said Huang.</p>
<p>Japanese-funded Panasonic Avc Networks Xiamen Co and ABB Xiamen Switchgear Co, the first JV company founded by Switzerland-based ABB in China in 1992, were among the list of early customers that XIB provided financial services to, which are still running to this day.</p>
<p>The bank also innovated in introducing lower-counter, more intimate customer service desks to clients. Before that, there were handrails between bank staff and clients. </p>
<p>The earliest investment in the bank came from Panin Holdings, a listed company in Hong Kong controlled by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, which converted its affiliated financial company in Hong Kong and Luso International Bank in Macao into XIB&#8217;s share capital, and co-founded XIB along with three domestic investors. </p>
<p>And in 1991, XIB increased its capital by introducing international financial organizations and strategic investors from developed countries and regions, being the first domestic bank to do so. </p>
<p>Its overseas shareholders included Asian Development Bank with 10 percent, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan with 10 percent, and US-based Sino Finance Group Co with 5 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;By introducing such overseas capital, XIB has forged a core competitiveness different from the old State-owned banks. This is a market-driven mechanism, which includes a market operation concept, modern corporate governance structure, advanced risk control concepts and so on, paving the way for the development of the domestic banking system later on,&#8221; Huang noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore, many domestic banks were enlightened by XIB&#8217;s introduction of foreign capital, which sparked great interest on the Chinese mainland, as they began to follow the trend by seeking investment from overseas,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Due to the restriction on JV banks in doing yuan retail business in China while having just ended its historical role as the &#8220;test ground&#8221; for financial reform, XIB transformed into a Chinese city commercial bank in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>An open future</strong> </p>
<p>China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, with authorities pledging to ease caps on foreign ownership in Chinese banks and financial asset management companies &#8220;within a few months,&#8221; Yi Gang, governor of the PBC, said at the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1039503.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boao</a> Forum for Asia back in April.</p>
<p>Chen Wenhui, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, was quoted as saying in a report by the Xinhua News Agency in May that opening-up in the banking and insurance sectors will help optimize the allocation of financial resources, so that they can better serve the real economy.</p>
<p>There is still ample room for the domestic financial sector to gradually open up while the process also indicates China&#8217;s increasing confidence in the sector&#8217;s development and its business environment, Huang believes.</p>
<p>Wang Yong, an associate professor at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Monday that as a strategic city for the China-proposed <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative%20News%20Desk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> (B&amp;R) initiative, Xiamen should connect more with countries and regions along the routes by making more ambitious moves in the financial sector.</p>
<p>Also, Xiamen has natural advantages in developing financial cooperation with Taiwan, Wang said, noting there are currently about 4,000 Taiwan-headquartered enterprises in Xiamen that need bank loans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the official exchange channel between the mainland and Taiwan has been suspended, the cross-Straits nongovernmental financial communications won&#8217;t stop,&#8221; he said, adding it is inevitable that Taiwan&#8217;s economic development will be integrated into the B&amp;R initiative.</p>

<p><em>This year marks the 40th anniversary of China&#8217;s reform and opening-up policy. During the past 40 years, China&#8217;s eastern coastal cities have been at the forefront of the nation&#8217;s economic reform. In particular, Quanzhou in East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, known for its vigorous private economy and homegrown brands, was cited in 2008 as one of 18 successful cases of local reform and opening-up. Global Times reporter Li Xuanmin recently paid a visit to the city to investigate the role of the private sector in Quanzhou&#8217;s economic growth. This is the first part of a five-part story.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Xu Jingnan, a businessman based in Quanzhou, East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, invested everything into building a shoe factory for Nike in 1983, he never imagined that his own business would &#8220;peak&#8221; to become a household name 30 years later.</p>
<p>Back in 1983, Xu, now the founder of China&#8217;s homegrown basketball shoemaker Peak, had just made his first pail of gold amounting to 10,000 yuan ($1,537) working as a porter, but after hearing that Nike would come to the coastal city, he invested all that money into building a downstream supply chain for the brand.</p>
<p>However, when the factory was completed, Nike unexpectedly withdrew from the deal, which frustrated Xu as he would lose all his investments if he didn&#8217;t take measures. </p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, the local government was also promoting the reform and opening-up policies, urging local farmers to start small businesses and build factories, so I thought &#8216;why shouldn&#8217;t I give it a try?'&#8221; Xu said. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was also inspired as the reform and opening-up gave locals like me who were born in rural areas with lower academic qualifications an equal opportunity to compete in the private sector.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Ups and downs</strong></p>
<p>Like Xu&#8217;s career, the shoemaking industry originated in Quanzhou in the early 1980s, when the market-driven economy rose under the reform and opening-up drive. </p>
<p>But things were not easy at the start. Without experience and equipment know-how, local entrepreneurs including Xu had to, at first, open individual workshops and rely on the expertise of their relatives who were in the shoemaking industry in Hong Kong and Macao as well as materials and sewing machines shipped from both special administrative regions.</p>
<p>The &#8220;working hard brings success&#8221; spirit of local entrepreneurs was demonstrated very early on. And by the late 1980s, a complete and efficient industrial chain for shoemaking had already been built up. </p>
<p>The motivation continues to this day, as illustrated by the sight of hundreds of shoe stores when driving down the streets of Jinjiang, a county-level city under the administration of Quanzhou, which is dubbed &#8220;China&#8217;s footwear capital&#8221; and the home to downstream industry chains like shoemaking machines and shoe cloth. </p>
<p>&#8220;Even a person without any basic knowledge of shoes could be trained into an industry expert when staying in Jinjiang for just one month,&#8221; joked Pan Hongyuan, the secretary general of the Fujian Shoemaking Industry Association. </p>
<p>In the 1990s, the shoemaking industry in Quanzhou embarked on a golden era when over 3,000 small- and medium-sized shoe factories were established, with their revenues ballooning at a rapid speed of between 300 percent and 400 percent every year. The shoe output from Quanzhou represented over 30 percent of China&#8217;s total shoe output at that time. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, overseas orders flowed into the city&#8217;s original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The profit for OEMs could even be as high as 10 yuan to 15 yuan a pair at that time. </p>
<p>This boom was also driven by an innovative and flexible fundraising model &#8211; <em>biaohui</em>, a type of loan club popular in eastern China. It works like this: a number of friends and relatives put their money together into a capital pool and members of the group bid for the money and the one who offers the highest interest rate wins the money. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the start-up period when the working class had limited access to funding, <em>biaohui</em> effectively addressed the problem by raising funds and helping the city&#8217;s small merchants take off,&#8221; Pan told the Global Times.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Vigorous private economy</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, as China&#8217;s reform and opening-up deepened, those OEMs struggled under shrinking profit margins in 2000. </p>
<p>Xu, along with other local entrepreneurs, is one of the first in the nation to shift strategy and come up with the idea of &#8220;building homegrown brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>To promote their brands, domestic shoe companies invested lots of money into celebrity endorsement and TV advertising. </p>
<p>&#8220;Circa 2003, industry insiders joked that the sports channel of China Central Television should be called &#8216;Quanzhou Local Television&#8217; instead because about 40 Quanzhou-based brands had paid for advertisements to be aired on the channel,&#8221; Pan explained. </p>
<p>He noted that almost all the most famous Chinese shoe brands, including Anta, Xstep and 361 Sports, were born in Quanzhou. And currently, &#8220;the local brands in Quanzhou account for 85 percent of China&#8217;s total sports shoe production,&#8221; Pan said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the development stage, Quanzhou&#8217;s private sector explored a leading shareholding system, where friends and relatives of the company&#8217;s founder borrowed through purchasing equity rather than mortgage loans &#8211; the early form of the modern joint stocks company. </p>
<p>&#8220;Starting from scratch, the city&#8217;s innovation in private company governance has vitalized the local economy during the 40 years of reform and opening-up,&#8221; Pan summarized. </p>
<p>And the shoe industry in Quanzhou is just an example of how the private sector has propelled the city&#8217;s overall economic growth. For the past 30 years, private businesses expanded at an annual rate of over 30 percent. </p>
<p>The city has cultivated a complete range of industries, with shoes, textiles and garments forming industrial bases in county-level cities like Jinjiang, and Shishi, each valued at more than $100 billion. </p>
<p>By August 2017, the city had 103 private businesses listed in the stock market, registering a market value of 450 billion yuan, according to media reports. However, after 40 years of economic reform, the city has now reached a dead-end, as labor costs have risen substantially, leaving a number of labor-intensive enterprises now scrambling to find new businesses to make a living.</p>
<p>A wholesale local shoe lace supplier in Jinjiang surnamed Chen told the Global Times that &#8220;exports to overseas markets stalled in the last two years,&#8221; which resulted in a drop in the company&#8217;s revenues. </p>
<p>As such, Pan has urged local merchants to upgrade industrial lines to contain costs. He pointed out that &#8220;transferring production lines to Southeast Asian countries where labor costs are relatively cheaper is inevitable, but the key is to develop a high-end industrial line and expand the reputation and sales of homegrown brands in overseas markets.&#8221; </p>
