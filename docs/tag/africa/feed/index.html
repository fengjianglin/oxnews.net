<br />Egyptian and Chinese officials hailed on Tuesday the progress in co-building massive skyscrapers in Egypt&#8217;s new administrative capital.</p>
<p>At the construction site, 50 km east of the Egyptian capital Cairo, China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) marked the progress with Egyptian partners in a ceremonial conference attended by officials from the Egyptian Housing Ministry and the Chinese embassy in Cairo.</p>
<p>The CSCEC started in mid-2018 building 20 skyscrapers in the planned new capital&#8217;s Central Business District (CBD).</p>
<p>Chang Weicai, general manager of CSCEC Egypt, told the attendees that the CBD project represents the implementation of both Egypt&#8217;s Vision 2030 and China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI) to seek common development among participating states.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seek to enhance cooperation with all Egyptian partners and join hands to make the CBD project the most beautiful urban construction in Egypt and North Africa,&#8221; Chang said, stressing that CSCEC has been a partner in the modernization process of Egypt since it entered the country over 30 years ago.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Some of the skyscrapers have already risen above the ground, including the Iconic Tower, which is currently standing at 80 meters high but is expected to finally exceed 385 meters to become the tallest tower in Egypt and Africa.</p>
<p>Khaled Abbas, Egypt&#8217;s deputy housing minister, pointed out that the CBD project is going as scheduled, adding that the ministry will start receiving the completed skyscrapers one by one from the second half of 2021.</p>
<p>He said that the Iconic Tower will be fully completed in mid-2022 to mark the completion of the CBD project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s more important than construction is to transfer the Chinese technology and expertise of building such huge towers to Egyptian engineers,&#8221; said the Egyptian minister, noting that about 600 Egyptian engineers and 4,000 Egyptian workers are working on the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Iconic Tower is actually &#8216;iconic&#8217; of the China-Egypt relations and a springboard for further continuous cooperation between the two sides,&#8221; said Ahmed Sallam, undersecretary of Egypt&#8217;s State Information Service.</p>
<p>Sallam, a former media consultant at the Egyptian embassy in China, told Xinhua that the China-Egypt ties are &#8220;distinguished.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the leaderships of both countries share their visions on boosting mutual cooperation and joint development, particularly under China&#8217;s BRI in which Egypt plays an important role.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The international community should present a common front to help South Sudan implement the 2018 peace deal, monitors tasked with overseeing the fragile pact said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Augostino Njoroge, chairperson of the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC), told a stakeholder meeting in Juba that time has come for the international community to speak with one voice and salvage the shaky pact from unraveling.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the 100 days already ticking, I urge the region and the international community to present a unified voice in support of the full and timely implementation of the peace agreement as we move forward,&#8221; Njoroge said.</p>
<p>The call came days after the U.S. recalled its envoy to South Sudan after the parties to the September 2018 agreement failed to meet the Nov. 12 deadline to a form unity government.</p>
<p>Njoroge said financial assistance and in-kind support is urgently needed to help the former foes to implement pending issues dragging back the agreement.</p>
<p>South Sudan descended into conflict in December 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy Machar leading to fighting between soldiers loyal to both leaders.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Buyers from Africa learn about Chinese excavators during the China Import and Export Fair in Guangzhou, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province in October 2012. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Excavators from China have become popular exports to African countries as the number of Chinese engineering and China-Africa cooperation projects under the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative grows.</p>
<p>Chinese are also offering training to local employees in Africa, giving them opportunities to become machine operators instead of manual laborers. As a result, their incomes have gradually increased, leading to an improvement in their living conditions.</p>
<p>Li Sha is vice president of the Sunward Equipment Group, which sells excavators to African countries. &#8220;They are mainly exported with Chinese enterprises that go to Africa for construction projects,&#8221; Li told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Belt and Road Initiative brings many opportunities for Chinese enterprises to cooperate with African countries, and these companies bring our excavators to Africa,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Orders for excavators from African countries such as Rwanda are increasing on cross-border e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba.com.</p>
<p>More than $2 billion of engineering machinery products were exported to Africa in 2017, growing 18.2 percent compared to 2016, according to statistics Alibaba.com provided to the Global Times.</p>
<p>One Chinese vocational training school started giving lessons on excavator operation in Rwanda to help local people learn how to operate the machines after buying them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is easy to learn to operate excavators and after mastering the operation skills, local employees&#8217; salaries will go up a lot,&#8221; Li said.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Pay raises</span></strong></p>
<p>A video posted by Alibaba.com on its official Weibo account shows that a worker from Rwanda can get RF</p>
<p>200,000 per month, about 1,500 yuan ($211), compared to the average monthly income of 500 yuan in the country.</p>
<p>In the video, a worker stands on an excavator at a construction site saying that this is a high income for local residents.</p>
<p>Li noted that manual labor costs in African countries are low, but someone who learns how to operate an excavator can see a significant increase in salary.</p>
<p>Excavators are also highly prized in other African countries. For example, advertisements for the machines can be seen around Abidjan international airport in Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, as a photo posted online shows.</p>
<p>Another photo shows excavator advertisements printed on arrival cards at Mali&#8217;s airport.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Growing market</span></strong></p>
<p>A new kind of amphibious excavator independently researched and developed by a Chinese enterprise was exported in batches to Africa in June 2017, according to a report on news.afrindex.com.</p>
<p>The vice president of the engineering machinery company Sunward Equipment Group said that they mainly sold excavators to developed regions such as Europe and US, but orders from Africa are now on the rise.</p>
<p>Although more excavators have been brought into African countries, there are few local employees who know how to operate the machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, some Chinese vocational training schools have begun offering training to locals. One of them signed a cooperation agreement with the Rwanda government in February 2018 and held its first class in June, Guangming Daily reported.</p>
<p>The report said that the class recruited 34 students as soon as it opened. It mainly trains students to operate and maintain the excavators.</p>
<p>After three months of training, students who pass the examination can obtain a certificate endorsed by the Rwanda government. The certificate allows them to find jobs at local construction companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreign students can go to China to learn skills, and Chinese schools can also go abroad to open classes in other countries,&#8221; the president of the vocational training school said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The training schools not only teach us survival skills and ability to change our home, but most importantly, they give us dignity. They are Starbucks from China for us,&#8221; said one excavator operator in Rwanda.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">The Bui Dam, a flagship project of China-Ghana cooperation, sits on the Black Volta River in northern Ghana. Photo: Courtesy of Sinohydro Corp</p>
<p>The year 2018 is his 23rd doing business in Ghana.</p>
<p>In 1995, when Tang Hong was assigned by his employer to develop clients in Africa, he visited Accra, capital of this nation of 28 million people on West Africa&#8217;s Gulf of Guinea. Three years later, Tang launched his own business.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Standing in the wine room of a hotel in which he has invested in Accra, Tang, today&#8217;s president of the Ghana Chinese Chamber of Commerce, told the Global Times he had no regrets venturing here.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first came here in 1995, bilateral trade was only $20 to 30 million, and Chinese goods were also not very competitive,&#8221; Tang said. &#8220;But now trade volume is more than 200 times that of 1995.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tang is not alone in liking Accra. </p>
<p>Zhuang Ruiming, a South African of Chinese descent, told the Global Times that he visited more than a dozen African countries in 2008 trying to find the right business opportunity.</p>
<p>He settled on Ghana, and so far has invested more than 200 million yuan ($30 million) in sand mining and oil refining.</p>
<p>As China pays more attention to Africa, so more adventurous entrepreneurs like Tang and Zhuang have been surfacing in Accra in recent years. </p>
<p><strong>China-Africa forum</p>
<p></strong>And as Beijing hosted the third summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, more such cooperation in Ghana can surely be expected in the future. </p>
<p>China was Ghana&#8217;s leading investor in 2017, with more than 700 investment projects. In addition, total trade between Ghana and China reached a record $7billion at the end of 2017, according to official data.</p>
<p>Government cooperation has also increased. One of the landmark projects is the Bui Dam: a flagship project that sits on the Black Volta River in northern Ghana. </p>
<p>The 400-megawatt hydroelectric dam was built by the government of Ghana and Chinese State-owned construction company Sinohydro.</p>
<p>After construction was completed in 2013, aside from increasing Ghana&#8217;s power generation capacity by 22 percent, the dam has also become something of a tourist attraction, Huang Guanghui, chief representative of Sinohydro, told the Global Times.</p>
<p><strong>Business environment</p>
<p></strong>Ghana won independence in 1957, and after decades of development is now a politically and economically stable country. </p>
<p>Since President Nana Akufo-Addo took office in 2017 and launched a series of reforms, including the One District, One Factory initiative, the economy has been flourishing.</p>
<p>Officials told the Global Times that, even though economic growth is remarkable, Ghana&#8217;s potential has not yet been fully tapped and opportunities abound in areas like infrastructure and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Whether a private entrepreneur like Tang or an official representative like Huang, all agree that Ghana is a lovely place to do business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ghana is one of the African countries that has the best environment for investment,&#8221; Tang said. &#8220;There are several key indexes to measure investment: stable political environment, rich resources and nice people, which Ghana has.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Ghanaian government takes education seriously. Ghana has the largest number of African students in China: More than 6,500 Ghanaians are studying in China. &#8220;People in Ghana are nice and well educated,&#8221; Tang said. </p>
<p>South African Zhuang agreed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&#8220;Ghana is a country with good security, stable politics, a sound legal system, peaceful people and a tradition of education,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As a coastal country, Ghana hosts a port for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</p>
<p>&#8220;When you talk about the ECOWAS region, composed of 15 countries, the population is about 300 million,&#8221; said Yaw Adu Gyamfi, president of the Association of Ghana Industries. </p>
<p>&#8220;With the stability of setting up a company in Ghana, the port provides opportunities to all these countries.&#8221; </p>
<p>If a company has a base in Ghana, &#8220;it&#8217;s easy to export its products to Nigeria and Gambia,&#8221; Gyamfi told the Global Times. </p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure &amp; transport</p>
<p></strong>When Ghana&#8217;s transport infrastructure has been improved, &#8220;then you can put companies anywhere in (Ghana&#8217;s) 254 districts to create opportunities and jobs,&#8221; Gyamfi said.</p>
<p>Ghana enjoys valuable resources such as manganese, bauxite, industrial diamonds, timber and rubber. </p>
<p>Ghana is also the world&#8217;s second largest cocoa producer and exporter after Cote d&#8217;Ivoire. But because of an immature infrastructure, Accra has not yet tapped its full potential.</p>
<p>An example is the flight from Accra to Kumasi, Ghana&#8217;s second-largest city.</p>
<p>Every day it is almost fully booked. Most business-people would rather take the 270-kilometer flight than drive to Kumasi.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes 30 minutes by air to go to Kumasi compared to driving, which takes from five to six hours,&#8221; Tang said. &#8220;If there were an advanced highway, a lot of resources could easily be transported and it would be much easier to do business.&#8221; </p>
<p>Joe Ghartey, Ghanaian railways development minister, gets Tang&#8217;s point.</p>
<p>&#8220;China, in terms of technology, corporate and financial assistance, has become a major player in the infrastructure sector,&#8221; Ghartey said. </p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s hardly an African country that is developing a railway network without China&#8217;s help. And we don&#8217;t want to do it any differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>After 23 years&#8217; development and as the two countries enhance cooperation, Tang&#8217;s business has expanded from trade to hotel management and manufacturing with more than 1,000 local employees.</p>
<p>Tang was elected president of the Ghana Chinese Chamber of Commerce (GCCC).</p>
<p>&#8220;As the president of GCCC I always encourage Chinese people and any Chinese who opens business here and invites me, no matter their business size, I will definitely go,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Zimbabwean Samantha Sibanda wants to alter perceptions of Africa in Asia by first inspiring the members of its diaspora.</p>
<p>For two days before the 2017 Pride of Africa Asia Awards in Beijing, Sibanda, its organizer, did not sleep. She was so committed to finalizing the finishing touches on the June 24 event that sleep became unimportant. But listening to her passionate welcome speech to the audience gathered that night, no one would have had any inkling of her fatigue. </p>
<p>&#8220;If I am saying to people to appreciate Africa, where does it start? You have to start with Africans; it has to start with us. We have to appreciate ourselves for the world to start to appreciate us,&#8221; said Sibanda, 39, to rousing applause.</p>
<p>The event, and many others like it, which Sibanda hosts under the banner of her Appreciate Africa Network, is a labor of love fueled by a desire to change negative stereotypes of Africans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason we are appreciating Africa today is so many times when you walk around in Asia, people when they see us, they either think we are teachers, or they think we are drug dealers,&#8221; Sibanda explained to the audience. &#8220;No one believes that we are capable of doing something good [other than being a teacher]. So, in this forum today, I just want to tell each and every one of you to try and showcase the talent that Africa has &#8211; the talent that people are not talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">The early years</span></strong></p>
<p>The only girl among eight children born to Elizabeth and Benjamin Sibanda in Bulawayo, the second-largest city in Zimbabwe, Sibanda, a mother of two, started learning Chinese to communicate better with the Chinese staff at a restaurant she frequented back home.</p>
<p>Later, as one of the first set of students to take language classes at the Confucius Institute at the University of Zimbabwe, she was invited to participate in its first cultural exchange trip about a decade ago.</p>
<p>While touring Guangzhou with the program, Sibanda was exposed to the many business opportunities and decided to create a plus-size clothing brand for her boutique back home. Two years later, in 2009, she decided to settle in China and moved to Beijing to work as a teacher. But the difference in the way she was treated compared to her white colleagues left a bad taste in her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;At my first job here in China they offered me 5,000 yuan ($737) and the white teachers were getting 10 [thousand] and above,&#8221; Sibanda said. &#8220;Teachers talk, and I felt bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school would also deliberately leave her out of photo shoots for its marketing materials, and when summer came, they would make her prepare a curriculum and give it to a white teacher because she did not have the &#8220;right face&#8221; to teach summer camp students. Some parents would also object to a black woman teaching their kids.</p>
<p>It was hard, but Sibanda remained quiet. She channeled her hurt into earning a master&#8217;s degree in psychology while working full-time as a teacher. </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">A fire is lit</span></strong></p>
<p>After graduating, Sibanda still found it difficult to get a suitable job, so she applied for an MBA through North China University of Technology and the Esuene Business School in Spain. But the racism from her classmates and teachers was worse. This time the people with the prejudices were foreigners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the only African and only black student in that class. From day one, no one wanted to sit with me. No one wanted to work with me,&#8221; said Sibanda. &#8220;We only had two Chinese in my class. It was that bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially silent, Sibanda focused on the fact that she was getting the same quality education as her classmates, until one day a Spanish teacher went too far, and she erupted.</p>
<p>The topic of the class was stereotypes. The teacher went around the room asking about stereotypes and had prepared videos of the different countries. But when it came to Sibanda&#8217;s country, instead of images of Zimbabwe, the teacher used images of the Maasai people in Kenya to represent all of Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said &#8216;imagine if you take this African man and put him in a car. He is more likely to die of a heart attack than if you put him in a den of lions,'&#8221; Sibanda recalled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I completely lost it. I won&#8217;t lie. I walked out of the classroom and stayed away from school for a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was like the entire world saw Africa as a dumping ground, Sibanda said, and it angered and disturbed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was when I decided that I would teach them. During an MBA, you have to register a company, so I registered the Appreciate Africa Network. I launched it on June 29, 2013. The reason I launched it was because of the stereotypes that people have of Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Challenges</span></strong></p>
<p>Four years later, Sibanda still has that fire in her belly. Since then, she has staged an Africa Night Speech Contest in which students tell the audience and judges about their country, a Miss Plus Size event to address body shaming, and a Discover Africa Academy in addition to the Pride of Africa Asia Awards on a near annual basis. </p>
<p>She holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree in English from the University of Zimbabwe, a master&#8217;s and a PhD in educational psychology from the University of East London, an MBA from the Esuene Business School in Spain, and a post graduate diploma in education from the University of Nottingham in the UK. But even with all this, she still faces many obstacles in bringing her projects to fruition, even from her fellow Africans.</p>
<p>She said getting support from members of the African community is often a challenge as some of them have disassociated themselves from the continent in order to get a better social footing. Some have even lied and said they are American or Caribbean to get jobs, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I blame the media. The only thing that they report on is disease and poverty. But Africa is 56 countries, and in the 56, there is a small area where people live in poverty. There are houses, infrastructure, wealth and minerals, but people don&#8217;t want to talk about that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to clear up these stereotypes and misconceptions because it is not true. Also, the more people think lowly of Africa, the more they will never appreciate us because to them we are like slaves. They don&#8217;t feel we deserve. Like I was saying about pay, to them it&#8217;s like you are an African, [so whatever they give you] is enough because back home you have nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the event, Sibanda handed out 38 Pride of Africa Asia Awards to African students and embassies as well as non-Africans who are debunking stereotypes of the continent. More than a quarter of the audience was Chinese.</p>
<p>When asked what keeps her going, Sibanda said her kids and her love for her country suffice.</p>
<p>She said living in a foreign country has opened her eyes to some of the negative stereotypes of Africa and has forced her to dig deep to change the narrative.</p>
<p>&#8220;China made me love my country, maybe even more than I would have back home,&#8221; she said. &#8220;China has given me that strength to stand up and be brave and tell people where I come from.&#8221;</p>
