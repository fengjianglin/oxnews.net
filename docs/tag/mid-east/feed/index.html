<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (C, front) poses for a group photo with some guests attending the Middle East Security Forum in Beijing, China, on Nov. 27, 2019. Mohammed Jassem Al-Sager (2nd L, front), chairman of Council for Arab and International Relations, was one of the guests. (Xinhua/Li Xiang)</p>
<p>The Middle East Security Forum hosted by China has contributed to enhancing peace, security and stability in the region, Mohammed Jassem Al-Sager, chairman of Council for Arab and International Relations and former chairman of the Arab Parliament, told Xinhua in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The forum, held in Beijing on Nov. 27-28, was an important event because of the &#8220;reasonable solutions&#8221; that were offered by China, said Al-Sager, who attended the forum and made a speech.</p>
<p>Themed &#8220;Security in the Middle East under the New Situation: Challenges and Prospects,&#8221; the forum focused on topics including regional fairness and justice, multilateralism, development for security, and dialogue among civilizations.</p>
<p>More than 200 senior officials and experts in the fields of strategy, diplomacy and security from China and the Middle East participated in the forum.</p>
<p>The forum highlighted China&#8217;s attention to the Middle East region and Arab world, Al-Sager said, noting that &#8220;it is a call from China, and the Arab world should respond to this call.&#8221;</p>
<p>China, the second largest economy of the world, is advancing in the technological and financial fields, and &#8220;we need it as an ally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>China is making efforts to promote economic and social development in the Middle East with an aim to achieve peace, security and stability in the region, the Kuwaiti expert noted, adding that he appreciates such efforts and urges the Arab world to extend the hand of friendship to China.</p>
<p>Being a fair country, China can play a role through its stance on the Middle East issues, he said.</p>
<p>On the cooperation between Kuwait and China, Al-Sager said that both countries are cooperating in many areas such as technology and tourism.</p>
<p>&#8220;China can offer proposals and suggestions in this regard,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">People take part in a protest in Baghdad, Iraq, on Oct. 29, 2019. (Xinhua/Khalil Dawood)</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Iraqi Independent High Commission for Human Rights (IHCHR) said on Thursday that a total of 31 demonstrators were killed and more than 1,000 others wounded during the past three days of anti-government protests in capital Baghdad and southern provinces. </p>
<p>A statement by IHCHR said that &#8220;the commission&#8217;s teams have registered, during the period from Nov. 26 to 28, the use of excessive force by the security forces, leaving 25 protesters killed in Dhi Qar province, four in Najaf province and two in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.&#8221; </p>
<p>IHCHR also expressed its deep concern about the high number of casualties among both the demonstrators and the security forces during the three days due to the violence and the use of weapons, as well as the burning of many public and private properties, including the Iranian consulate in Najaf, some 160 km south of Baghdad, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry condemned in a statement the attack by some demonstrators on the Iranian consulate in Najaf on Wednesday night. </p>
<p>The ministry said the purpose behind burning the Iranian consulate is &#8220;to harm the historical relations between Iraq and Iran, as well as with the rest of the world states whose missions are working in Iraq.&#8221; </p>
<p>It reaffirmed its warning that there are some persons who want to derail the demonstrations by distorting the fair demands of the demonstrators. </p>
<p>The Iraqi ministry affirms that &#8220;the diplomatic missions operating in Iraq are highly respected,&#8221; and what happened to the Iranian consulate &#8220;does not represent the Iraq&#8217;s official point of view.&#8221; </p>
<p>Many protesters accuse neighboring Iran of interfering in Iraq&#8217;s internal affairs. </p>
<p>Mass demonstrations have continued in the capital Baghdad and other cities in central and southern Iraq since early October, demanding comprehensive reform, accountability for corruption, improvement of public services and job opportunities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Iraqi security forces cracked down on anti-government protesters in the strife-torn south on Thursday, leaving 22 people dead in a bloody escalation hours Â­after the torching of an Iranian consulate.</p>
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, as commander in chief of the armed forces, dispatched military chiefs to several restive provinces to&nbsp;&#8220;restore order,&#8221; the military said in a statement.</p>
<p>Iraq&#8217;s capital and its south have been torn by the worst street unrest since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, as a youth-dominated protest movement has vented their fury at their government and its backers in neighboring Iran.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday protesters burnt down the Iranian consulate in the city of Najaf, yelling &#8220;Victory to Iraq!&#8221; and &#8220;Iran out!&#8221; in an attack condemned by Tehran which voiced its &#8220;disgust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iraq&#8217;s death toll in the street clashes since early October has surpassed 360 with more than 15,000 wounded according to an AFP tally, as authorities are not releasing updated or precise figures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protesters burning tires and throwing rocks and petrol bombs have clashed with security forces unleashing tear gas, rubber coated bullets and live rounds.</p>
<p>Demonstrators across the country have blamed Iran, Iraq&#8217;s powerful eastern neighbor, for propping up the very government they seek to topple.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, streets in Najaf were largely deserted due to the curfew, with public servants told to stay home.</p>
<p>Iran meanwhile demanded Iraq take decisive action against the protesters, with Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi condemning the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iran has officially communicated its disgust to the Iraq Ambassador in Tehran,&#8221; he said in comments carried by Iran&#8217;s state news agency IRNA.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo:VCG</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday said the Israeli settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories have &#8220;no legal validity&#8221; and constitute &#8220;a flagrant violation&#8221; of international law. </p>
<p>&#8220;Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most intractable challenges facing the international community. Regrettably, over the past year, there have been no positive developments, and the situation on the ground continues to deteriorate,&#8221; Guterres said in his message for the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. </p>
<p>The message was read by his chef de cabinet Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti to a meeting held by the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People to observe the international day. </p>
<p>The UN chief said the intensification of illegal settlements, demolitions of Palestinian homes and the pervasive suffering in Gaza must stop. &#8220;These actions threaten to undermine the viability of establishing a Palestinian state based on relevant United Nations resolutions.&#8221; </p>
<p>At the same time, he said, the indiscriminate launching of rockets and mortars toward Israeli civilian populations must cease. </p>
<p>He called on Israelis and Palestinians, and all their supporters, to take steps that will restore faith in the two-state solution. &#8220;There is no viable alternative.&#8221; </p>
<p>He stressed that only constructive negotiations between the parties, in good faith, with the support of the international community and adhering to long-standing UN resolutions and long-agreed parameters &#8220;will bring about a just and durable solution, with Jerusalem as the capital of both states.&#8221; </p>
<p>Viotti, for her part, stressed the importance of addressing &#8220;the immense&#8221; suffering of civilians in Gaza where some two million Palestinians live in poverty and unemployment, with restricted access to healthcare, education and basic services, and impacted daily by Israeli-imposed closures. </p>
<p>She said Palestinians in Gaza have the right to protest peacefully and Israeli security forces have a responsibility to exercise maximum restraint. </p>
<p>She also noted indiscriminate launching of rockets and incendiary devices toward Israeli civilian populations should stop. </p>
<p>Some eight million Palestinians live primarily in territories occupied by Israel and across the Middle East in countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. </p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo:VCG</p>
<p>UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, in his remarks, called for action to ensure critical humanitarian support for the refugees in need. </p>
<p>&#8220;This must be tackled by strengthening the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), to ensure that it can meet the humanitarian needs of over 5.4 million Palestinian refugees,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is important that we collectively safeguard the agency against the political and financial challenges it faces.&#8221; </p>
<p>In addition, he noted that Wednesday&#8217;s commemoration &#8220;reminds us that we have a collective task of resolving the lingering Palestinian issue. This is important given that for about seven decades, the question of Palestine has remained unresolved.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;It is the civilians who suffer the most from the violence, killings, incitement, demolition, illegal settlement activities and so on. We must work with utmost sense of justice and faith in this matter,&#8221; he urged. </p>
<p>The International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People is an annual observance designated by the UN General Assembly on Dec. 2, 1977 to commemorate its adoption of a resolution on Nov. 29, 1947 to partition the mandate of Palestine into two states. </p>
<p>Events commemorating this date are held at the UN headquarters in New York and UN offices in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna and other cities around the world.</p>

<br />More than three million Yemenis displaced by civil war are struggling to survive this harsh winter.</p>
<p>The displaced families live in tattered tents in camps outside cities, enduring cold winds, rains and hungry. They fear their malnourished children could face higher risks of death.</p>
<p>In a camp for the internally displaced people on a windy hill outside the Yemeni rebel-held capital Sanaa, around 564 displaced families suffers from worst humanitarian situations.</p>

<p>The displaced families lack clothes, woolen blankets, drinking water, food, medical care, shoes and milk for their children. Many of them sleep hungry on the tent&#8217;s cold floor until their hands and legs were about to freeze from the severe frost.</p>
<p>&#8220;We appeal to any aid organization or charity to visit us,&#8221; Nabil Salem, a father of six children, told Xinhua in the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very cold, we need blankets, clothes and food,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Salem, his wife and their six children have been in this camp for nearly four years. He was a farmer in a village in the mountainous area of Nehm, near the Yemeni northeastern province of Marib. They left everything behind to escape death after the fighting reached edge of his village in 2016.</p>

<p>Mahdi Mohammed, a father of another displaced family in the camp, also appeals for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lack the most basic needs such as food, medicine, blankets and education,&#8221; he said, complaining that his family&#8217;s tent is very old and rains penetrate it.</p>
<p>Yemen&#8217;s civil war has been raging on for nearly five years. It erupted after the Iran-allied Houthis stormed the capital Sanaa in late 2014 and forced the Saudi-backed Yemeni government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.</p>
<p>The war has killed tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, displaced over three millions and pushed the impoverished Arab country into the brink of famine.</p>

<p>The United Nations&#8217; Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Yemen has estimated 3.3 million people remain displaced, up from 2.2 million last year. It said the number of sites hosting displaced people has increased by almost half over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths has been shuttling between the Yemeni rival parties to reach a political settlement for ending the conflict.</p>
<p>The UN humanitarian aid agencies say the conflict in Yemen has caused the world&#8217;s worst humanitarian crisis in modern history.</p>
<p>The young girls and boys in the displacement camp, about 30 km north of Sanaa, are cold and hungry, but they stare toward the horizon with eyes full of hope.&nbsp;</p>
