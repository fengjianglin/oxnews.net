<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT</p>
<p>Behind the skyrocketing passion for blockchain, a buzzword that has penetrated Chinese social media over the past few days, is the nation&#8217;s strategic vision: striving for a place in the financial world of the future.</p>
<p>The passion that instantly translated into speculative bets in the equity and cryptocurrency markets is expected to trickle into the core competitiveness of the economy, which is and will be rivaling the US on multiple fronts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain is surely one of the most chic words and phrases in the rapidly evolving tech world, alongside artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. But unlike its more perceivable peers, blockchain has in most cases appeared to be a bewildering specter in the world&#8217;s largest internet market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there has been a sudden interest from the public about the obscure word, since the nation&#8217;s top leadership espoused the development and application of blockchain technology at a group study session of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online posts about what blockchain is about and which stocks fall under the category of blockchain shares have instantly made the rounds on WeChat and Weibo. Blockchain stocks across the Pacific have rallied and the bitcoin price has soared. In a striking example, NASDAQ-listed Chinese blockchain-related firm Xunlei saw its shares more than double on Friday before closing high, up over 18 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Blockchain shares in the Chinese mainland market also went crazy on Monday, with the blockchain sector, comprising more than 100 stocks, posting a gain of nearly 9 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investing craze is indicative of the market&#8217;s eagerness to capitalize on the nation&#8217;s unprecedented endorsement of the technology. With the fall of peer-to-peer lending eclipsing fintech innovation and cryptocurrency trading, one of the most noted cases of blockchain usage, largely being linked to baseless speculation, the high-note push for blockchain development is apparently inspiring.</p>
<p>Remarks by the top leadership elevating the role of blockchain technology in technological innovation and industrial transition have shown that the world&#8217;s second-largest economy hinges future competitiveness on the buzzword. Additionally, the ensuing speech at a Shanghai financial forum on Monday by Huang Qifan, the outspoken former Chongqing mayor, revealed that China&#8217;s central bank is likely to be the first to issue a digital currency.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the country passed a cryptography law on Saturday. The new law to come into force on January 1, 2020 will regulate cryptography for both government and private uses. This apparently lays a legal foundation for the blockchain drive, considering that cryptography is a core component of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having secured a leading position globally in mobile payment, with Alipay and WeChat Pay extending their reach into overseas markets, it&#8217;s time for China to ready itself for a place in the future world featuring digital currency competition.</p>
<p>Trade tensions with the US have prompted a rethink of China-US economic ties. US sanctions on a number of Chinese technology firms have apparently indicated the vulnerabilities of a reliance on US supplies of core technologies. With fintech disrupting the traditional financial landscape and an increasing number of countries considering the launch of digital currencies, plans to embrace the next big thing in the completion playbook ought to prevail in China. That explains why the limelight has been put on blockchain.</p>
<p>With Facebook&#8217;s announcement of its Libra cryptocurrency in June and the most recent breakthrough claimed by Google in quantum computing, it seems the US is in an advantageous position to continue its financial dominance in the future.</p>
<p>To prevent a continuance of US supremacy in the financial world of the future, China has upped its stakes to carve out its competitiveness in enabling blockchain-powered growth. After all, the US&#8217; dominance over the past few decades has increasingly favored the nation&#8217;s self-serving protectionist intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now all eyes are on China, which is staging an unprecedented competition against the US for a better, blockchain-defined future.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Xia Qing/GT</p>
<p>Not long after, there will be cheers again for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India&#8217;s top tech company, to once again outdo IBM in market value. The sad part yet to be realized or acknowledged is that the achievement attests to, at the most, the South Asian nation&#8217;s strength in the IT services subsector of the wider tech world.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s domination of Silicon Valley in positions of power is certainly a contributor to its IT sector &#8211; the US represents roughly two-thirds of Indian IT services exports &#8211; whereas the domination that portrays an exodus of India&#8217;s brightest tech talents should take the blame for the nation&#8217;s invisibility in tech leadership at large.</p>
<p>Mumbai-headquartered IT services major TCS is arguably one of the brightest stars in the nation&#8217;s sizzling stock market. A bull run in the Indian equity market that was not interrupted by a global downturn in 2018 has continued into this year.</p>
<p>The top tech company in India crossed the $100 billion mark in market value in April 2018, making it the first Indian company to break that barrier.</p>
<p>In one step further, TCS beat IBM in market capitalization in June when Indian stocks surged to record highs. A correction since has made a dent in both achievements, which are set to be regained in the near future, however.</p>
<p>After Wednesday&#8217;s trade, TCS&#8217; market value stood at 783,666.78 crore rupees ($110.35 billion) on the Indian National Stock Exchange, while IBM&#8217;s market capitalization hit $125.51 billion on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).</p>
<p>The Indian stock market that has rallied since an unexpected corporate rate cut was unveiled last week is on course to scale new highs prior to the bi-monthly monetary policy in October, BloombergQuint reported on Tuesday, citing Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies LLP.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while China&#8217;s stock market pales in comparison to India&#8217;s, China&#8217;s top tech companies are far ahead of their Indian counterparts.</p>
<p>NYSE-listed Alibaba saw its market capitalization near $460 billion after Wednesday&#8217;s market close, more than four times that of TCS.</p>
<p>In another sign, the US remains stable at 18 of the world&#8217;s top internet companies by market capitalization, while China is home to seven of them, per Mary Meeker&#8217;s annual internet trends report released in June. Alibaba, ranked six, led the Chinese companies making the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the five remaining comes from India.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that India&#8217;s tech prowess, still largely confined to IT services, is nowhere close to China, one of the twin engines in the tech world that now derives most of its power from internet-driven innovation.The question then arises: How could India, which embarked on IT services development in the 1960s, become invisible in the internet world nowadays? The answer actually lies where the nation&#8217;s techies are proud of &#8211; Indians&#8217; superb performance in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Among Indians and Indian Americans in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley tech giants are Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft. It&#8217;s almost inevitable that Indians become part of the default settings Silicon Valley companies, both established ones and start-ups, are equipped with.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of businesses in India that act as a go-between to funnel Indian IT talents into the US market. Many training and educational facilities in the nation also help with exports of tech talents.</p>
<p>Behind the Silicon Valley fervor are handsome salaries that dwarf the hefty investment in education. In addition, a job in Silicon Valley could mean much higher dowry payments by Indian women. In the country where boys are seen as an investment and girls deemed a liability, it is not rare that girls&#8217; parents have to take loans or sell their assets to afford the dowry payment.</p>
<p>No wonder young people would make every attempt to get a job in the US innovation hub. As a consequence, India fails to translate its early success in IT services into sheen in the internet era.</p>
<p>Also worth pointing out is that kind of prevalence deserves a rethink in that the Indian management style could easily incite complaints and in some cases invoke dismay.</p>
<p>An anonymous post on Zhihu, China&#8217;s version of Quora, which had been edited on Sunday by a Chinese software engineer now working in Silicon Valley, claims that Indian managers treat their subordinates like minesweepers who clear the frontlines of a battlefield, and later take the credit for their work when in front of senior-ranking executives.</p>
<p>Management stratification that has made it difficult for Chinese talents, and especially those from the mainland, to break the Silicon Valley glass ceiling, nonetheless, adds strength to China&#8217;s tech sector that is now bracing for the artificial intelligence revolution (AI).</p>
<p>Along with China&#8217;s rise in AI, both domestic and global talents are seen setting their eyes on innovation hubs in China. In the case of India, a continuation of obsession with Silicon Valley would only distance itself from global tech leadership.</p>

<p>Two big technology events in China lately have once again put the nation&#8217;s capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) in the spotlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony of the 2019 Smart China Expo in Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing Municipality on Monday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He stated that China needs to strengthen AI basic research and technological research and development.</p>
<p>A variety of AI hardware and applications showcased at the 2019 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, which runs from Thursday to Saturday, have stirred greater interest in AI technologies that are all the rage these days.</p>
<p>Still, China needs to stay coolheaded and push for technology-based innovation amid escalating trade tensions with the US. This seems especially the case in the arena of AI, which has increasingly become a two-man contest.</p>
<p>Findings from a recent survey by US consulting firm A.T. Kearney showed that 39 percent of almost 450 senior business executives worldwide reckon that China is likely to overtake the US as the global leader in AI, while 35 percent of the respondents think this scenario is unlikely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numbers measuring the global AI landscape also suggest China is playing catch-up with the US. By the end of March, there were 5,386 active AI firms across the world, according to figures released in April by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a research institute under the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/6.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a>. The US is home to 2,169 AI firms while the Chinese mainland has 1,189 AI companies. The UK is ranked third with 404 AI businesses, followed by Canada with 303 and India with 169.</p>
<p>Besides, 17 of a total of 41 AI unicorns globally are in China, while the US is home to 18 of them, per CAICT data.</p>
<p>The AI rivalry that could give clues about the future strength of the two economies certainly matters a lot, especially taking into account the worsening trade situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But rather than getting enthralled by the accomplishments that might create an atmosphere of pompous optimism, China needs to scale up its effective AI investment to turn the tech buzzword into an economic engine.</p>
<p>That means greater spending on AI research, hardware, talent and adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some industry data already points to China getting ahead of the US in AI investment, but there remains skepticism over the extent to which the investment in AI, or the various technologies and concepts revolving around AI, can be translated into China&#8217;s AI prowess. A fast-track approach to funding and capital market success risks eroding the foundations of AI strength.</p>
<p>A Wall Street Journal report earlier in August revealed that SoftBank-backed Indian startup Engineer.ai, which claims to use AI to automate the development of mobile apps, in fact relies on human engineers to put together the apps, a striking example of exaggerated AI savviness that should serve as a warning to numerous companies in China that have ridden, or plan to ride, the AI wave.</p>
<p>The call made by Liu, the vice premier, to double down on AI basic research therefore points industry participants in the right direction.</p>
<p>As for AI-optimized chipsets and wide-ranging gadgets using AI technologies, a raft of Chinese companies are already among the early players in the market.</p>
<p>Last week, Huawei unveiled its data center AI chip, promising more computing power than rivals. On Wednesday, Chinese search engine Sogou, betting its future on AI, announced it will open up its dictation services to third-party voice recorder companies. It also announced the creation of an AI innovation alliance with digital voice recorder makers including Aigo, Newmine, Sony and MSC.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, greater commitments are still required on the hardware side. With more progress on in-house AI chips, the nation could be a step closer to its goal of advanced chipmaking. This would mean that China&#8217;s AI ambition won&#8217;t be at the mercy of others.</p>
<p>In the case of talent nurturing, an annual AI training camp organized by Kai-fu Lee&#8217;s venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures can be seen as a prototype of efforts to build sustainable AI talent pipelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the closing ceremony of the third DeeCamp, which was launched by Sinovation Ventures in 2017, at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing earlier this month, a handful of AI-powered projects was presented, including an AI program playing farmers versus landlords, a popular Chinese card game.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s training camp wrapped up with 600 students from 130 universities both home and abroad finishing 50 AI projects within merely four weeks, under the guidance of top industry mentors such as Lee.</p>
<p>Some of the DeeCamp participants have joined Sinovation Ventures and other AI ventures, adding to the talent pool for China&#8217;s AI prowess.</p>
<p>It is hoped that more companies, especially promising startups in the arena, could join the talent push.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of startups was highlighted by International Data Corporation (IDC) at an innovation salon in Beijing in the middle of August. The market research firm said that the latest round of the AI boom has been led by star startups, which have performed exceptionally in proving appealing to users, among other aspects, in the niche markets of computer vision, speech recognition and language understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI startups will arguably play an increasingly significant role in innovating technologies, turning technologies from concepts into working prototypes, and deploying applications.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, AI technologies need to gain wider adoption. This calls for efforts to push more traditional sectors in the home market to embrace the new technology, as well as to pitch made-in-China AI products and applications to overseas markets.</p>
<p>A sub-forum on AI development along the routes of the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI) to be hosted by Shanghai-based AI startup DeepBlue on Saturday during the WAIC might give an idea of how China&#8217;s homegrown AI expertise can be exported to BRI markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company proposed the establishment of a BRI AI industrial alliance in January. The first batch of countries and regions joining the alliance includes Indonesia, Singapore, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. More BRI economies are expected to join the alliance at the sub-forum.</p>
<p>Such initiatives will over time build China into a global hub for AI, putting it in an unrivaled spot in future power wrestling.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT</p>
<p>Closer tech links between China and Europe, a trend that&#8217;s already catching on, could be the smartest way to mend the tech world which has been split apart by the unruly US government.</p>
<p>It has so far proven fairly hard to convince the US government to stop erecting excessive barriers for foreign investment in US technology, especially Chinese investments in US tech. This would certainly cut off the link between US technology and global technological advancement.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the tech world, minus US companies, wouldn&#8217;t simply cave in to tougher scrutiny of tech deals applied by the US administration. If one finds one of the most-favored paths blocked, there would normally be two solutions &#8211; either clear the roadblock or take another road. Apparently, tech dealmakers in China, increasingly a bustling hub for science and technology innovation, have opted for the second solution.</p>
<p>While a majority of China&#8217;s outbound tech investments announced in the first quarter still flowed to North America and Asia-Pacific, European targets saw a marked increase in popularity, per a new report from London-based technology advisory and investment firm GP Bullhound.</p>
<p>As measured by deal volumes, Chinese tech investments in Europe jumped 25 percent in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter, while deals by Chinese tech investors in the US shrank by 13 percent, continuing a downward trend. Chinese tech investments in the Asia-Pacific region cooled down during the quarter &#8211; falling by 53 percent &#8211; from a surge over the previous quarter.</p>
<p>In value terms, outbound tech deals across Asia into North America plunged by 47 percent on a quarterly basis to $2.5 billion in the first quarter, while Asian deals in Europe soared 57 percent over the quarter to $3 billion, according to the report, citing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) as a major hurdle.</p>
<p>The numbers speak compellingly about a man-induced shift in tech transactions. A striking example is the acquisition of London-headquartered payments company WorldFirst by Alibaba&#8217;s Ant Financial earlier this year following the US move last year to block the sale of MoneyGram to Ant Financial on national security grounds. In a sign of the US&#8217; rise as a deterring power, WorldFirst abruptly shut down its US operations to enable the deal.</p>
<p>With the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, an ambitious CFIUS reform, signed into law in August 2018, CFIUS&#8217; workload, as well as its authority to mandate reviews or unilaterally take action, has been expanded. A stronger CFIUS as such will likely result in a hollowing out of foreign technology investment in the US, a lose-lose scenario for the global technology world at large. Over the longer term, its resulting closer tech links between other countries deterred by potential regulatory hurdles will end up eroding American tech prowess.</p>
<p>Now that Chinese tech power, arguably smart money, has appeared to be increasingly favoring Europe, the tech innovation boat with both China and Europe aboard can be banked on to restore investor confidence in the global technology market.</p>
<p>To ensure a safe and successful voyage, both sides should go faster in clinching a bilateral investment deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two sides commit to achieve in the course of 2019 the decisive progress required, notably with regard to the liberalization commitments, for the conclusion of an ambitious China-EU Comprehensive Investment Agreement in 2020,&#8221; read the joint statement issued after the recently concluded 21st China-EU Summit in Brussels.</p>
<p>With trade war clouds still lingering, especially as Europe risks being the next theater of the trade war for the US administration, it would be a wise move if China and Europe could quicken the pace of finalizing a bilateral investment deal. A quicker move will certainly give both an advantage, ensuring the benefits of both Chinese and European businesses, in the tech world in particular.</p>
<p>If that is the case, CFIUS might lose its deterrent value, thereby reducing the undue influence of politics on the global technology landscape. Also worth noting is that the EU, which began screening foreign direct investment into the bloc this month under a new framework, ought not to follow CFIUS&#8217; steps. What best suits the continent is a continuation of the smartest approach to tech world salvation, a belief held by China as well.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT</p>
<p>Since the December 1 arrest, in Vancouver, of its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, Shenzhen-based multinational conglomerate Huawei Technologies Co has indisputably become the most high-profile Chinese company by which to measure the nation&#8217;s technological pride amid the unprecedented trade tensions with the US.</p>
<p>With Cupertino-based Apple Inc, the once invincible iPhone maker, increasingly falling out of favor in the Chinese market, where local brand names, notably Huawei, are becoming extremely fashionable, it could be said that the tensions &#8211; on many occasions termed as a trade war &#8211; have reinforced a shift in Chinese public consumption esthetics toward homegrown tech products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that&#8217;s not to say the nation&#8217;s pride in its technology is being blindly driven by a populist sentiment. Instead, it points to the colossal progress local companies have made over the recent years in narrowing the technological gap between China and developed countries, which inadvertently makes some feel nervous as well as lays the psychological groundwork for the Chinese people to proudly opt for indigenous brands.</p>
<p>There are signs that headwinds, on multiple fronts, especially on the political side, that the Chinese telecoms firm is faced with, have driven the intrinsically motivated company into a greater commitment to research and development (R&amp;D).</p>
<p>As an indication of its commitment, Huawei took the wraps off its next-generation chipset for servers last week. The new chipset known as the Kunpeng 920 is named after a giant bird in Chinese mythology, apparently signaling the company&#8217;s ambition to fly high in the global tech space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chipset, based upon architecture from UK-headquartered ARM which is now owned by SoftBank, is envisioned to give a big boost to Huawei&#8217;s cloud business, extending its strength beyond the sphere of telecommunications equipment and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest addition to Huawei&#8217;s 7-nanometer chip portfolio that also includes the Kirin 980 created for its smartphones and the Ascend 910 designed for artificial intelligence applications running in the cloud is expected to further enhance the company&#8217;s capabilities in one of China&#8217;s weak links in the tech world, namely chipmaking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Chinese tech houses such as Beijing-based Xiaomi Corp have also in recent years ventured into making their own chips, as part of broader efforts to elevate homegrown brands into new tech trendsetters.</p>
<p>Whatever headwinds there might be, a persistent pursuit of technological innovation ought to be the fundamental factor behind a sustainable success of any business.</p>
<p>In a compelling example, while Apple is still immersed in identifying the culprits for its lackluster performance, its Chinese rivals are continuing to pile up their technological strengths and competitive advantages that have resulted in a consumer shift, in not only China, but many other markets, away from the likes of Apple and Samsung toward Chinese-branded phones and other devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a letter to investors earlier in January which surprisingly revised down the company&#8217;s revenue guidance for its current December quarter, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote &#8220;while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the company&#8217;s revenue shortfall to its guidance, and more than 100 percent of its year-over-year global revenue decline, occurred in the Greater China region across iPhone, Mac and iPad, claimed the letter.</p>
<p>It is true that the Chinese economy is slowing down and mobile phone shipments in the market that&#8217;s hitting saturation are in decline. However, they alone do not justify Apple&#8217;s poor performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statistics from Counterpoint Research showed that in the third quarter of last year, Huawei, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi were the top four phone vendors in the Chinese marketplace for smartphones, capturing a share of 23 percent, 21 percent, 21 percent, and 13 percent, respectively. Apple only earned fifth place in the ranking with a 9 percent share.</p>
<p>The latest iPhone models are seeing massive price cuts by retailers across China, deepening woes over Apple&#8217;s viability compared with its local competitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the years, from the announcement of the iPhone 4 in June 2010 which established Apple&#8217;s position as the most formidable premium phone vendor on the planet, to the current huge discounts its newest phone models are facing as buyers no longer believe they are worth the cost, Apple should have realized that the market has changed.</p>
<p>The rise of Apple&#8217;s Chinese rivals, most impressively Huawei, to the extent that it reverses an iPhone-centric smartphone fever, proves that the offerings of exciting features at reasonable prices can over time lead to a fundamental change. Therefore the prevailing motto: keep investing in R&amp;D and always put innovation first.</p>

<p>The trade war with the US for the past 10 months has taught Chinese people one truth &#8211; that is to steadfastly invest in technology innovations, in order to shore up China&#8217;s manufacturing competitiveness and global market prestige.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vigorously investing in technology innovations&#8221; is likely to be the central and dominating ideology for this country in 2019 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether China is able to achieve 6.3 percent or 6.5 percent GDP growth in 2019 or not, is far less important than the investments in research and development. Technology advances can only be achieved by persistent investments that could pave a solid foundation for future economic expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What the top leadership in Beijing has been suggesting recently is to &#8220;hold China&#8217;s destiny firmly in our own hands&#8221; &#8211; implicitly indicating the belief on the part of the policymakers that China should spare no efforts to close its technology gap with developed economies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That the US government imposed in middle 2018 a supply embargo on Shenzhen-based telecommunications company ZTE that immediately brought the firm&#8217;s production to a standstill, effectively bringing the company to its knees, is a thundering alarm bell for all Chinese people. Later ZTE struck a deal with the US to pay a staggering fine of more than $1.4 billion for alleged equipment sales to Iran.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That ZTE case has rubbed the eyes of many Chinese, who now believe that China must build up its own preemptive technology advantages, and very quickly.</p>
<p>A country&#8217;s technology strength actually decides its eventual position in the world. German and Japanese-made cars sell well on the global marketplace because of their high quality and fuel efficiency, enabled by their high manufacturing technology levels. So are aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus, semiconductor chips by Samsung and Qualcomm, as well as the high-speed railway systems made by China.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the lingering US-China trade war which is inflicting rising pain on both economies, Chinese people now pin their hopes on the technology start-ups in the country, to lead the country up the technology ladder in 2019 and 2020 and for many more years to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also hope policymakers in Beijing to invest more human and monetary resources into promising technology ventures to incentivize and galvanize their progress and development. At the same time, our Chinese consumers need to broadly support this country&#8217;s technology companies by placing more domestic products and services on their shopping list in 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to Huawei Technologies, which has grasped a leg up in 5G superfast mobile equipment and is found in 5G smart phones and cloud servers, we really hope that China&#8217;s other technology heavyweights &#8211; Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu in particular &#8211; will stand up and spearhead the next round of innovation investments and breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three seem to have set their aims on the right targets. Alibaba vowed in 2018 to put its focus on quantum computing and artificial intelligence semiconductor chips, so as to support the company&#8217;s rapidly growing cloud and IOT (Internet of Things) businesses. The e-commerce giant said that its first self-developed AI inference chip &#8220;Ali NPU&#8221; will be ready for market use in the second half of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tencent reshaped its business structure in 2018 by establishing a new business group for cloud and smart industries. It is setting up a technology arm to help promote innovations, and also to wean itself off reliance on revenues generated from video games. And, Baidu has recently ratcheted up investments to build up advantages in AI, algorithm, data intelligence and computing power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The catch-up bid in technology innovations should be the responsibility of all advanced business ventures in the country, be they State-owned, collectively-run or private-owned companies. It is an endeavor that China cannot afford to lose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many role models for Chinese entrepreneurs to follow suit. Dong Mingzhu, chair of home appliances maker GREE Group, has launched a chipset manufacturing plant to help make up for the country&#8217;s shortage in advanced semiconductor chips. Dong is to be commended for her ambitions irrespective of whether her attempts are successful or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Yang Yiqiang Photo: Li Qiaoyi/GT</p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s Note:</p>
<p>While commercialization has become a common noun in a world that&#8217;s being propelled by business innovation, its usage in the space sector remains something new, which is especially true with China&#8217;s space missions. Nonetheless, with the country&#8217;s Long March carrier rocket series and an array of space start-ups gaining increased global attention, space commercialization is springing into a high frequency phrase. In an exclusive interview with Global Times reporter Li Qiaoyi (GT) earlier in December in Zhuhai, Yang Yiqiang (Yang), the first commander-in-chief of the Long March 11 solid-fuel carrier rockets project, described policy priorities and to-do lists toward turning China into a major space power. </p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt">
<p>
<strong>GT: How do you look at Chinese carrier rockets&#8217; outreach into the global market thus far? What do you think might be the obstacles in the path of Chinese carrier rockets taking on their global counterparts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yang:</strong> It&#8217;s been a dream for several generations of China&#8217;s space industry participants to go out to the world. A most notable example is a group visit to the US in 1980s led by Huang Zuoyi, then a Long March rocket engineer. Huang hand-drew a rocket model known as the Long March 2E, proposing to send US satellites aloft atop the rocket equipped with four liquid-fuel strap-on boosters. We put forward plans to get it done in 18 months and the US side didn&#8217;t quite believe it. But in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we pulled it off completing the relevant contract within 18 months. </p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />Thereafter the Long March rockets carried into orbit Australia&#8217;s Optus B1 satellite and Motorola&#8217;s Iridium satellites, setting off our journey into the world of space programs. But I would say the US still takes a jaundiced view of China&#8217;s space missions, especially after the Report of the Select Committee on US National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with China,&nbsp;commonly known as the Cox Report&nbsp;after Representative Christopher&nbsp;Cox, was published in 1999.</span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />The main obstacle to Chinese space program&#8217;s overseas outreach is the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), under which some chip products or even some unimportant items are banned from being carried by Chinese rockets. The ITAR mechanism also stipulates that some of the equipment used in rocket research and manufacturing is not allowed to be sold to China. It is hoped that China and the US could hold high-level talks regarding the issue. </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />We are now walking a different path, having launched telecommunications satellites for developing countries such as the Laos, Bolivia and Belarus. In this way the country&#8217;s space missions are integrated into the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative%20News%20Desk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> initiative, thereby reaching out to the global market. It&#8217;s inevitable that China&#8217;s space program would gain a global foothold. I hope the US industry peers and government can be fair-minded and unprejudiced toward China&#8217;s space missions. </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />
  <!--?xml:namespace prefix="o" ns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /--><br />
  <o:p><br />
   &nbsp;<br />
  </o:p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>GT: Chinese launch start-ups such as&nbsp;OneSpace and iSpace see growing activities over recent years. How would you describe the role they play in China&#8217;s space ambitions?</strong></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><strong>Yang:</strong> These companies are truly engaged with the space sector, working on rocket manufacturing. It is rather difficult for a combination of some people with experience in the space sector, students majoring in relevant disciplines, and several investors to explore the industry with high entry barriers. It is by no means an easy mission, considering a lack of technological knowledge and test facilities. Other than the entry barrier issue, they are also faced with a problem of the sharing of intellectual property rights. </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />Take Elon Musk&#8217;s&nbsp;SpaceX. Before 2010, industry watchers were not bullish on the US aerospace manufacturer. The situation has changed quite a bit since then, thanks to talent mobility. NASA&#8217;s&nbsp;space shuttle program came to an end with the Atlantis&#8217; Space Shuttle launch in 2011, and SpaceX succeeded in poaching a lot of the talent. The company&#8217;s rising to prominence is also attributed to shared intellectual property. The use of intellectual property, which is certainly not free, is enabled through a set of regulations. Beyond that, the US government and military continued to grant contracts and advance funding to the company when its space attempts failed several times. That is unimaginable to us. </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />The commercialization of the space sector also creates enormous benefits for the US government and military. The United Launch Alliance including Lockheed Martin&nbsp;Space Systems and&nbsp;Boeing&nbsp;Defense provides spacecraft launch services to the US government, resulting in substantially lower prices for many significant projects. </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />There certainly needs to be support for talent mobility and shared intellectual property. But that is supposed to be put under the purview of rules and guidance. The so-called national team which includes China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the main contractor for China&#8217;s space program, is also a collection of companies that shoulder social responsibilities as well as strive to prove commercially viable. Therefore, efforts are envisioned in the pipeline to devise a mechanism to protect the national team&#8217;s interests while ensuring their intellectual property are converted to social benefits. The creation of the mechanism will be dependent upon government efforts. </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />
  <o:p><br />
   &nbsp;<br />
  </o:p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>GT: China&#8217;s maiden private attempt in late October to send a satellite carrying rocket into space by Beijing-based start-up LandSpace failed to reach orbit after liftoff.&nbsp;Is it a warning sign that perhaps a private space commercialization bubble is brewing in China?</strong> </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br /><strong>Yang:</strong> The rocket was launched at 4pm on October 27. I took a close look at it because many of the company&#8217;s launch team previously worked with me. I knew them well. Despite the failure, the team was respectable, with the launch of the three-stage rocket lifting off without a hitch in the first and second stage. It can&#8217;t be said that the failed mission was doomed, but that has something to do with investor demands. I personally consider that it was a publicity stunt rocket. The launch of the rocket, if successful, would have shown the public and investors that the company is capable of making rockets, while the rocket was not genuinely intended to be put into use. A successful launch would help the company win more points while a failed mission would risk resulting in a substantial reputational loss. </p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US">That points to a predicament faced by space start-ups, as it&#8217;s fairly difficult for social capital to offer long-term support for a company&#8217;s development. Globally, there are very few companies in the space sector that can achieve profitability. The competition now centers on technological innovation that is being relied on to showcase the companies&#8217; capabilities so as to secure sustainable long term funding. The day of profitability of the commercial space sector at large hasn&#8217;t arrived yet. </p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US">For that day to come, a large number of satellite constellations planned both by China and the US ought to turn into a reality and will bring genuine commercial benefits to the public. That will take some time. </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />
  <o:p><br />
   &nbsp;<br />
  </o:p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>GT: How innovative are China&#8217;s commercial space missions?</strong> </p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Yang:</strong> The innovative capacity of China&#8217;s space program is shown in the country&#8217;s success in sending small rockets into space. Compared with other countries, China has spent much less to carve out its own path of fast development.</p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US">Other than the technological side, an enormous passion for space projects in China&#8217;s capital market, albeit being a double-edged sword, is also worth noting. And although space talent mobility in the country is barely comparable to the US levels, China&#8217;s talent pool that comprises people in their 50s like me, and also those in their 20s, 30s and 40s, is an advantage that even the US cannot match. Many Chinese space talent in their 30s already assume the role of director of rocket design. This is unimaginable in overseas markets.</p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US">In addition, except for a few pieces of equipment such as integrated circuits, all of the country&#8217;s space intellectual property is proprietary. </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />
  <o:p><br />
   &nbsp;<br />
  </o:p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>GT: How does the space commercialization effort in China compare to the US? What are key areas for cooperation between China and the US in space commercialization?</p>
<p></strong></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Yang:</strong> China&nbsp;is among the&nbsp;second-tier&nbsp;countries in terms of space commercialization while the US is among the top tier. China has yet to become a major space power. The gap lies in lifting capacity, among other parameters indicating the comprehensive functionality of a rocket, and the lift span and functionally of satellites. </p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US">It is believed that China and the US will compete to lead the next phase of space commercialization, especially the commercialization of low-earth orbit. As for cooperation between the two countries in commercializing the space sector, I would say China wants its space program to reach out to the rest of the world, and I understand that both NASA and US companies are willing to get in touch with the Chinese side. But US regulations such as ITAR still serve as barriers to bilateral cooperation in this regard, although space, like other industries, is being globalized.</span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />
  <o:p><br />
   &nbsp;<br />
  </o:p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>GT: What still needs to be done for there to be a sound regulatory framework for rocket launches in China?</strong></p>
<p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Yang:</strong> There are strict review and approval procedures for rockets to be launched. A group of experts such as me will be consulted about space product eligibility. Meanwhile, there are clear requirements regarding orbits and radio frequencies that need to be met before rockets are allowed to be lifted. <br /></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US">Nevertheless, there is yet to be a set of technological standards to underpin the approval process like airworthiness approvals applied in civil aviation. A mechanism intended to offer a judgment in technological terms has to be put in place so as to measure how safe and reliable a rocket or satellite would be. The rocket and satellite manufacturers and associated companies are supposed to provide relevant data. Simply relying on comments of experts is not advisable. <br /></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US">The review and approval mechanism, essentially quantitative, needs to be initiated as fast as possible. <br /></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US">The future development of China&#8217;s commercial space sector also requires greater efforts to address the issue of overlapping supervisory&nbsp;responsibilities&nbsp;among different government bodies. The US&nbsp;National Space Council could provide some clues about what China is supposed to do to create a well-functioning mechanism for space commercialization. </span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><br />
  <o:p><br />
   &nbsp;<br />
  </o:p></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>GT: India appears to keep a keen eye on China&#8217;s space missions. How much progress India has made in its own space program?</strong><br /></span></p>
<p class="A" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-US"><strong>Yang:</strong> I don&#8217;t have much contact with India regarding their space projects. I would argue that India is not at the same level as China in the space sector. India records limited space activity. The country is also open to overseas markets in space terms, but the openness is quite limited. Unlike China which has fumbled its way into space strength, India has been dependent on the US and Russia to develop its space program.</span></p>

<p>While there has been much discussion of the tech world rivalry and competition between China and the US, the sphere of immersive technologies arguably calls for greater joint collaborative efforts. This may yet make it possible to create a virtual wonder world as attractive as the OASIS in Steven Spielberg&#8217;s sci-fi movie &#8220;Ready Player One.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a fresh attempt to lay bricks for a simulated world that might one day turn out to be an OASIS equivalent, location-based hyper reality experience creator The VOID unveiled a new fully immersive experience center at Resorts World Genting, Malaysia, last week, the first of its kind in Asia. Including the new Asia location, the US-based company now has nine experience centers across the globe, with five in the US, two in Canada, and one in Dubai, UAE. </p>
<p>Guests try on customized equipment that comprises a head-mounted display, backtop computer and a haptic vest. This enables them to escape from their real world into a 15-minute journey inside the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; universe or the world of &#8220;Ralph Breaks VR.&#8221; The whole set of gear may feel rather clumsy, but the full-body immersive experience it provides is impressive.</p>
<p>John D Watkins Jr, CEO for The VOID Asia, told the Global Times that the company hopes to open its first China location by summer 2019. If all goes as planned, it will be an example of China-US cooperation in prying open the virtual reality (VR) market. </p>
<p>In fairness, VR headsets and the use of augmented reality (AR) technology in smartphones are already familiar. The increasing availability of VR experiences &#8211; via various technology fairs, or shopping malls in Chinese cities where a few minutes trying out a VR headset costs a few dozen yuan &#8211; means that the once-magic technology is now within reach. </p>
<p>A VR theme park was also opened in April in Southwest China&#8217;s Guizhou Province, offering visitors a variety of VR experiences. </p>
<p>However, mass adoption of immersive technologies is still a long way off. VR devices are not likely to become as ubiquitous as smartphones in the foreseeable future. That is not because VR headsets are too expensive. Entry-level VR gadgets from a variety of vendors cost just a few hundred yuan. The problem is that the technology does not yet offer a truly immersive experience that can make users genuinely feel they are part of a virtual world. The scarcity of VR-enabled content is another factor holding back the VR market.</p>
<p>This situation pertains not only to China, but also the US and other markets. There is actually a belief that the China market &#8211; where smartphones and mobile payment have become an essential part of people&#8217;s lives &#8211; could be the most promising one for interesting new technologies to be rapidly adopted. </p>
<p>As part of the nation&#8217;s push for innovative growth, the State Council, China&#8217;s cabinet, unveiled a development plan for strategic emerging industries during the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/972044.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13th Five-Year Plan</a> (2016-20) at the end of 2016. The plan calls for ramped-up efforts to push for innovative development of VR, AR, holographic imaging, glasses-free 3D, and other technologies. It is hoped that growth in the digital innovative sector can create new consumption trends. </p>
<p>Thus far, however, consumers have had to be patient &#8211; they can not expect a world as fantastic as the OASIS just yet.</p>
<p>Location-based VR experiences, exemplified by The VOID&#8217;s offerings, are currently the most effective solution for melding the physical and digital worlds.</p>
<p>But it is not easy to make such offerings a sustainable commercial success, let alone create real world substitutes. What makes the US-based company stand out from the rest is not just its equipment, but its collaboration with ILMxLAB, Lucasfilm&#8217;s immersive entertainment division, and Walt Disney Animation Studios. These heavyweight partners help to pique people&#8217;s interest in giving it a try. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s something Chinese businesses involved in the virtual world need to learn from. Without appealing content, VR will not get beyond hype. </p>
<p>In the case of China&#8217;s VR sector, cooperation with foreign ventures adept at VR intellectual property creation will be vital. This could lay the groundwork for a future world in which everyone can enjoy both real and virtual lives.</p>

<p>All opportunities come from contradictions and variations, as is the case with stocks &#8211; without rises and falls, no one would have the opportunity to make a profit. Therefore, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily matter whether the market is currently on a downward spiral or an uptrend. So long as the contradictions and opportunities are identified, there will be ways to make money. The principal contradiction facing Chinese society now is the one between unbalanced and inadequate development and people&#8217;s ever-growing needs for a better life, according to the report following the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. </p>
<p>A rising desire to purchase among people in lower-tier cities offers a good opportunity for China&#8217;s supply-side imbalance to be addressed. The fact that daily necessities and clothing items are more expensive in some areas than in big cities is attributed to scattered consumption &#8211; supplying goods on a smaller scale creates multiple intermediate links, leading to higher costs for companies and thus higher prices in lower-tier cities. </p>
<p>But things are changing. Beijing and South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province have continued to be among the top regions witnessing inflows of people since 2010, but the population gains have fallen substantially compared with the previous 10 years. Meanwhile, Sichuan, Hubei and Guizhou provinces, which had long seen outflows, are now beginning to see population inflows instead. </p>
<p>The nation has ramped up urbanization reforms over the past few decades. The urbanization rate is projected to hit 68.7 percent in 2030, up from 35.9 percent in 2000. The first phase of urbanization reforms has come to an end, highlighting the urbanization of peripheral rural areas of first- and second-tier cities. It&#8217;s now come down to third- and fourth-tier cities, which are gaining a rising number of new residents. In previous relocation efforts, migrant workers who left their families behind would not consider their places of work as their homes, but the current household-based relocation effort shows a trend toward genuinely relocating their homes and spending most of their earnings on that. This points to a sea change in consumption structure. </p>
<p>Also noteworthy is that the country&#8217;s burgeoning middle classes hope to purchase a variety of products at competitive prices. This explains the emergence of e-commerce sites such as NetEase Yanxuan, Taobao Collection and Biyao.com. The middle classes are now able to go outside the country and can discern good products for themselves. They can no longer be easily hoodwinked into buying inferior products or paying a premium for top brands.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people in lower-tier cities have lower levels of debt than those in first- and second-tier cities, mostly owing to home prices. This means they are willing to spend more. </p>
<p>Along with the demographic and social changes, there has been a shift in internet industry structure. The internet&#8217;s development in the country can be divided into three stages, with local businesses primarily learning from the US model in the first stage, and taking advantage of the country&#8217;s demographic dividend to overtake the US in mobile internet services in the second stage. </p>
<p>There is a theory regarding the internet: The value of a network is positively correlated to the square of its total users. From the outset of the third stage in 2014, WeChat has become the prerequisite for the development of new business models and the companies that have rapidly floated on the stock market.</p>
<p>Many Chinese companies have expanded into overseas markets. The overseas push was initially shown to be typified by utility app and game developers led by Cheetah Mobile before extending to overseas shipments of devices and supply chains. Chinese phone maker Transsion Holdings&#8217; dominance in the African market is an example of homegrown brands catering to local markets. The phone maker derives its popularity from its face recognition specifically for dark-skinned people and the offering of phones with four SIM slots. This has now evolved into an overseas push for Chinese-born business models. Behind many companies that have international-sounding names and that are registered in places like Singapore or Bangkok, stand teams of Chinese entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Adding to the overseas drive is the prevalence of mobile gadgets, notably smartphones, across China, as well as the penetration of mobile payment into almost every corner of the country. An increasing number of elderly people have also become a part of the smartphone community and the mobile payment world. </p>
<p>With the nation&#8217;s urbanization rate expected to reach 68 percent by 2030, still a long way off the levels in the US and Japan, it is believed that there is immense potential for the economy to sustain its growth. If that is the case, whatever trade wars there might be, China doesn&#8217;t need to be afraid, as China&#8217;s market will be large enough to ensure self-sufficiency. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese businesses are becoming more active in the commercial space sector, and this will be vital for building the nation&#8217;s strength in an industry that is increasingly important for future competitiveness. </p>
<p>In one of the latest moves, Chinese Wi-Fi tech firm LinkSure Network has just unveiled plans to blanket the world with free internet access from space, joining global forerunners including Google, Facebook, SpaceX and OneWeb in the race to build space-based internet services.</p>
<p>LinkSure Network is known for its free Wi-Fi sharing app Wi-Fi Master Key, which has over 800 million monthly active users across the globe, according to the company&#8217;s latest data. At an event in Beijing last week, the Shanghai-based firm announced that it would cover the world with free satellite internet by 2026.</p>
<p>The ambitious mission will be achieved by the launch of a two-tier low earth orbit satellite constellation, composed of 72 backbone satellites orbiting at an altitude of 1,000 kilometers above the earth&#8217;s surface and 200 smaller satellites orbiting at an altitude of 600 kilometers. </p>
<p>The plan was initiated in 2016, according to An Yang, chief scientist for the company&#8217;s satellite project. The first satellite is scheduled to be sent into space next year at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China&#8217;s Gansu Province, and by 2020 the first 10 satellites will be put into orbit, An revealed.</p>
<p>LinkSure Network&#8217;s plan is just one example of the recent burst of activity in the country&#8217;s bourgeoning commercial space market.</p>
<p>In late October, e-commerce giant Alibaba Group took the wraps off its space strategy, announcing that it plans to put a mini space station and a communications satellite into orbit.</p>
<p>This will help to improve online-to-offline integration during the November 11 &#8220;Singles&#8217; Day&#8221; shopping carnival, said Alibaba, adding that it also hopes to work with scientific research institutions and for relevant space technologies and autonomous driving technologies to be translated into real-world applications.</p>
<p>Beijing-based space startup Commsat Technology Development has also revealed plans to send up seven satellites at the end of the year to help explore key Internet of Things technologies. Startups such as OneSpace and iSpace have also played a role in raising China&#8217;s global profile in the arena of commercial space projects in recent years. All these domestic ventures were given a boost in 2014, when the State Council issued an announcement encouraging private capital to make inroads in civil space infrastructure construction.</p>
<p>Chinese commercial space initiatives are not yet near the likes of US-based SpaceX, which is planning crewed spaceship missions, but there have been signs that local businesses are becoming more competitive.</p>
<p>An from LinkSure Network said at the Tuesday event that each of the satellites will be equipped with a small robot to pinpoint faults in the event of extreme weather and will be able to make relevant forecasts. The robots will be capable of making repairs to the satellites and controlling their independent operations so as to ensure the satellites are kept in good shape. Various kinds of satellite fault information will also be sent to the ground to allow for the ground staff to gain more experience. </p>
<p>It seems it&#8217;s only a matter of time before domestic businesses close the gap with their global counterparts in the commercialization of space. </p>
<p>But it must be remembered that there are risks associated with space missions, and accepting failure will be a key part of the country&#8217;s commercial space journey.</p>
<p>Beijing-based startup LandSpace launched the country&#8217;s maiden private attempt to loft a satellite carrying rocket into space in late October, but the attempt failed. But that is certainly not the end for the firm; SpaceX has also had several failed attempts. </p>
<p>Also, there is still a lot that must be improved if local commercial space efforts are to achieve a long-lasting success.</p>
<p>Along with brisker space activity in the years to come, the country will need to have the foresight to expand the capacity of existing rocket launch sites. </p>
<p>And for there to be sustained growth, as well as efforts to push for space-related technological advancements and innovations, there must also be a drive to put in place laws and regulations specifically designed to oversee commercial space projects. </p>
