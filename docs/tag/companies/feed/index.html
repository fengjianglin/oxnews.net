<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Gree&#8217;s stock price closed high on Monday morning at 59.96 yuan ($8.65), after Gree said it will be without a controlling shareholder as the private equity firm Hillhouse Capital becomes the biggest shareholder of Gree Electric on Monday. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Hillhouse Capital will take over 15 percent of Gree&#8217;s shares at a price of 41.6 billion yuan ($5.9 billion).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">As Hillhouse Capital takes over Gree&#8217;s shares, the company is now without an actual controlling shareholder and left with a new management system, which is deemed as a modern shareholding system. Numerous companies are under such a system, including Pingan and TCL, according to a report by yicai.com </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Market participants generally believe that with such a large quantity of investment, the cash flow will lead to higher dividend requirements from major shareholders. It is expected that Gree&#8217;s dividend rate will increase in the future, the report said. </span></p>

<p>Shao Hua, general manager of Heihe City Natural Gas Development Co., Ltd. of China Gas, said that the border city of Heihe still largely relies on coal for heat. With the Sino-Russian natural gas pipeline&#8217;s operation, the city now has access to a stable supply of clean energy.</p>
<p>Heihe has registered 30,000 households for switching to natural gas for heating. It will take one year to complete full coverage of the gas network in the city, according to the company.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s factory activity expanded more than expected in November, as the private Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers&#8217; index (PMI) rose to its highest level in almost three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts said that the trend reflects increasing domestic and international orders and a general upgrade in the economy, and manufacturing will further look up if China-US trade relations improve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Caixin manufacturing PMI hit 51.8 in November, up from 51.7 in October, and exceeded the expected 51.4. November marked its highest readout since 2017, after four consecutive months of increases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a number below 50 falls into the contraction range.</p>
<p>Manufacturing activity has been improving as global and domestic demand rises, Liu Xuezhi, a senior economist at the Bank of Communications, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Domestic demand elevated in the third quarter, Liu said, adding that the performance of export-oriented manufacturing has resumed to some extent thanks to the positive signals of China-US trade talks.</p>
<p>The PMI in the coming months is expected to keep in expanding area, though it may not surge given that the downward pressure on the world economy persists, Liu said.</p>
<p>The increasing manufacturing activity shows that the effects of a new economic driving force have been kicking in, Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>Though China is still in a tough phase of industrial upgrading, its new industries are growing with great momentum, and will set an example of innovative development for other industrial sectors, Cong said, noting that November&#8217;s PMI is a positive indicator for anticipated investment from both domestic and overseas sources.</p>
<p>The rising Caixin manufacturing PMI is in line with the earlier PMI released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday, which also returned to the expansion range. Both indicators suggest an overall improvement in production of China&#8217;s manufacturing sector.</p>

<p>China Guangfa Bank will use voiceprint recognition technology in identity authentication, after the application of fingerprint and facial recognition technology in the banking industry, media reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The bank said that voiceprint recognition technology will play a role in preventing fraud and providing quality services.</p>
<p>Voiceprint identification technology was in the first batch of tools confirmed in a fintech products catalogue recently published by China&#8217;s central bank and its market supervision administration.&#8217;</p>
<p>Voiceprint recognition, also known as speaker recognition, is a technology that converts the sound signal of speaker into an electrical signal, which is then compared and identified by computer through&nbsp; algorithms, the Technology Daily reported on Monday.</p>
<p>According to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/8.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Public Security</a>, the accuracy rate of voiceprint recognition has reached 99.8 percent and everyone&#8217;s voiceprint is unique.</p>

<p>The turmoil in Hong Kong may have put more than 3,000 air workers at risk as the local government warned it may revoke the license of Hong Kong Airlines, should it fail to improve its financial situation by Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong Airlines, Hong Kong&#8217;s third-largest airline, said in a reply to the Global Times on Monday that it will cut capacity and flights amid weak travel demand caused by non-stop turmoil in Hong Kong. The carrier also said it will further consolidate its network and focus on premier routes.</p>
<p>The carrier, under the cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, announced on Friday that it will cease flights to Canada&#8217;s Vancouver, Vietnam&#8217;s Ho Chi Minh City and North China&#8217;s Tianjin Municipality, the second time for the airline to suspend long-distance flights within one month. It announced on November 4 that it would end flights to Los Angeles, starting from February 8, 2020.</p>
<p>The Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) of Hong Kong warned on Monday that the airline&#8217;s financial position had deteriorated rapidly, and the ATLA said Hong Kong Airlines must, by Saturday ensure a cash injection or face the risk of the suspension or loss of its operating license in the region.</p>
<p>According to data from the Hong Kong Tourism Board, visitor arrivals in October slumped 43.7 percent year-on-year, with tourist arrivals from the Chinese mainland down 45.9 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>The carrier said that it regularly provides its operational and financial improvement plans to the ATLA and the Transport and Housing Bureau in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>It added that it has implemented cost-saving measures, while adjusting operations from time to time to respond to worsening market demand, according to the e-mail reply sent to the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The China-Russia East Route natural gas pipeline is set to enter service on Monday, according to the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC). Through the pipeline, Russia will deliver a total of 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas to China over the next 30 years.</p>
<p>About 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia will be delivered to China in 2020, and the amount will be gradually increased to 38 billion cubic meters per year, the CNPC on Monday said in a statement on its website.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s pipeline branch is responsible for the construction and management of the project.</p>
<p>Stretching from Russia&#8217;s Siberia to China&#8217;s Yangtze River Delta, the pipeline covers a total length of 8,000 kilometers, and 5,111 kilometers within Chinese borders. The project extends from Heihe, Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province, to North China&#8217;s Hebei Province and then to East China&#8217;s Shanghai Municipality, through a total of nine provinces and municipalities.</p>
<p>Following a 20-year negotiation, China and Russia reached the more than $400 billion contract in May 2014. The east natural gas pipeline has become a landmark project of China&#8217;s third-generation pipeline construction.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s petroleum and natural gas pipeline network is expected to cover 240,000 kilometers by 2025, according to China&#8217;s guidance in the sector. About 100,000 kilometers of new petroleum and natural gas pipeline will be constructed.</p>
<p>In the first 10 months of this year, China imported 415 million tons of crude oil, up 10.5 percent year-on-year, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. The country&#8217;s imports of natural gas stood at 77.71 million tons during the same period, up 7.9 percent year-on-year.</p>

<p>Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou published a letter she had written on the one-year anniversary of her arrest in Canada, in which she said she was &#8220;no longer afraid of the unknown&#8221; despite moments of fear and torment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the letter, she also thanked people ranging from Huawei colleagues and customers to Canadian officers for giving her &#8220;warmth&#8221; and &#8220;support.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear friends, your warmth is a beacon that lights my way forward, and I appreciate it more than words can say,&#8221; she wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter was published on Huawei&#8217;s official website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meng was arrested in a Vancouver airport at the request of the US on December 1, 2018. The case has evolved to be what many Chinese observers call a stalemate between China and Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the letter, Meng said it was never her intention to be stuck in Canada but that she had found a whole year had &#8220;snuck by&#8221; since her arrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The past year has witnessed moments of fear, pain, disappointment, helplessness, torment, and struggle… I have also learned to face up to and accept my situation. I&#8217;m no longer afraid of the unknown,&#8221; she wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meng also listed many examples of the support she had received, such as the choice made by Huawei customers and suppliers to trust the tech giant, the waiting crowds every time she appeared in court, and the encouraging comments like &#8220;Go Huawei&#8221; left by take-out delivery workers on orders delivered to their campuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on and you will become a hero. Chinese people will back you up,&#8221; one netizen wrote on Weibo, commenting on Meng&#8217;s public letter.</p>
<p>Meng also said she was &#8220;deeply moved&#8221; by the kindness of people in Canada, saying that she had burst into tears after hearing applause in the public gallery when she was granted bail by the judge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I no longer feel so far from home. I&#8217;m no longer afraid of the rough road ahead. While my personal freedoms have been limited, my soul still seeks to be free. Amid these setbacks, I&#8217;ve found light in the life around me,&#8221; she wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, paid a visit to Meng on Thursday. He said the Chinese government will continue to urge Canada to correct its mistake and take measures to solve the issue as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calls were still loud Sunday on Chinese social media for the release of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou one year after her arrest in Vancouver&nbsp;airport at the request of the US.</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s case has evolved to be a linchpin in a stalemate between China and Canada, Chinese observers say, noting that breakthroughs made by the Chinese telecommunications giant over the past year prove that the US attempt to contain Huawei&#8217;s achievements and China&#8217;s technological rise has and will continue to come to naught.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Cong Peiwu, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Canada, also paid a visit to Meng in Vancouver.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government is determined to protect the just and legitimate rights and interests of its citizens and enterprises, and will continue to urge the Canadian side to correct its mistake and take measures to solve the issue as soon as possible,&#8221; Cong said, as quoted in a statement posted Friday on the website of the Embassy in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great motherland and nearly 1.4 billion Chinese people are your staunchest supporters. We expect you to go back to China safe and sound at an early date,&#8221; the statement said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition proceedings for Meng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei&#8217;s daughter, are scheduled for January, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has yet to respond to&nbsp;the Global Times&#8217; request for disclosure on the progress of the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detention of Meng has deeply hurt China-Canada relations, and both Canada and the US have staked their international reputations on the case, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US request for Meng&#8217;s extradition from Canada is destined to end in failure, he believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition request was based on insufficient evidence, which means it would be impossible for the request to be justified in the Canadian legal system, Yang asserted.</p>
<p>A thorough and complicated procedure must be gone through before any extradition request is validated, he explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case will most likely either become &#8220;a protracted juridical war that may last 10 years or even longer,&#8221; or result in a solution that all the three sides involved can agree on, he added, stressing that the solution won&#8217;t be what the US wants.</p>
<p>Huawei has also become a bone of contention in the China-US trade tensions, during which the US has launched multiple offensives against Huawei.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A temporary experience store of Huawei in Shanghai on Saturday Photo: VCG</p>
<p>In the words of Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, China has not given in at the trade talks with the US and Huawei has not collapsed amid the US-initiated blockage.</p>
<p>In a fresh move, the US Federal Communications Commission announced a decision on November 22 barring the use of an $8.5 billion government fund to buy equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE on national security grounds.</p>
<p>Huawei said it would make an announcement at an event in its Shenzhen headquarters on Thursday about filing suit to challenge the FCC&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen-based technology giant has reportedly secured over 50 commercial 5G contracts across the globe, with 28 from Europe, 11 from the Middle East, six from the Asia-Pacific, four from the Americas, and one from Africa, the company revealed in&nbsp;September.</p>
<p>Huawei said it had delivered over 200,000 5G base stations and built nearly two-thirds of all 5G base stations shipped globally.</p>
<p>The US blockage has prompted Huawei to shift toward Japan for imports of chips and other core components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has pioneered the nation&#8217;s push for indigenous technological prowess, Xiang told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering Huawei&#8217;s flagship 5G system on a chip (SoC) as an example of the company&#8217;s edge over its global rivals in terms of core technology, Xiang reckoned the company has largely weathered the US attempt to contain Chinese tech products and solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest data from Berlin-based market intelligence platform IPlytics showed, as of November, Huawei&#8217;s declared 5G patents total 3,325, topping the global 5G declaration rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies following Huawei include Samsung with 2,846, LG with 2,463, Nokia with 2,308 and ZTE with 2,204.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highest-rated US company is Qualcomm at seventh 7th with 1,330 declared 5G patents.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A Tesla Model 3 on display in Shanghai on Sunday Photo: Xie Jun/GT</p>
<p>Chinese customers are ready to pay for Tesla&#8217;s Model 3s assembled in its Shanghai plant, as the US carmaker made a dash to advertise its electric cars before delivering the first batch in January or early February, Tesla&#8217;s salespeople said on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s investment in China, made at a time when the two countries&#8217; relations are imperiled by the lasting trade war, will pay off with costs reduced and brand image enhanced in the world&#8217;s largest electric car market, experts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>In a little more than one week since Tesla unveiled its first made-in-China Model 3s at its showrooms across China, feedback from local customers is positive, said a salesperson at one of Tesla&#8217;s stores in Shanghai.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now more than half of Tesla&#8217;s recent orders are for the locally made Model 3s,&#8221; the salesperson, surnamed Jin, told the Global Times. He didn&#8217;t reveal how many made-in-China Model 3s were sold at his store or by Tesla recently. Tesla didn&#8217;t reveal the presale number either on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At another Tesla store also located in downtown Shanghai, a salesperson said that local customers had worried that the made-in-China Model 3s would be inferior to made-in-US cars in quality, but such worries have eased after Tesla displayed the China-built cars in the stores, allowing customers to have firsthand experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually the first batch of locally made Model 3s will be nearly the same as the overseas version in performance, although Tesla will switch to made-in-China battery cells, which will reduce the endurance mileage a little bit,&#8221; he said on condition of anonymity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Global Times saw in the store from 12:30-1:30 pm on Sunday that the white China-built Model 3 attracted more inquiries than a US-made Model 3 displayed by its side. Many visitors inquired about details and reserved times for test drives.</p>
<p>Both the salespeople told the Global Times that after the company starts delivering China-built Model 3s soon, the made-in-US Model 3s will no longer be sold in the country. The last batch of imported Model 3s will be delivered in China at the end of this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s plant in Shanghai, built in less than 10 months, is the company&#8217;s first plant outside of the US and also China&#8217;s first plant wholly owned by a foreign carmaker. It shows what some overseas media have called Elon Musk&#8217;s bet on China&#8217;s electric vehicle market to make the carmaker profitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He made the bet at a hard time, when the US and China are embroiled in a protracted war that resulted in fluctuating tariff levels and when the US government has called for US companies in China to return back home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But experts are mostly optimistic about the future of the US carmaker in China as it moves toward a localization strategy, although they said that challenges remain for the new brand that targets affluent consumers.</p>
<p>A prominent challenge comes from rising competition, as companies, whether traditional automobile giants or domestic carmakers, beef up efforts to launch electric cars for the rapidly evolving market in China.</p>
<p>For example, domestic electric car brand NIO will launch an ES6 Coupe later in December that will compete against the Model Y. Xiaopeng will deliver an electric vehicle called P7 in 2020, which is to be sold at a cheaper price than the Model 3 but with a longer mileage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think an even bigger threat will be coming from the traditional carmakers, such as Volkswagen and Audi, which are scrambling to shift to the electric car arena. With their ample technological reserves and abundant funds, they should make strong competitors to Tesla,&#8221; Wu Shuocheng, a Shanghai-based car analyst, told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But overall he sounded optimistic about the future of Tesla. &#8220;Localization would reduce the cost of production for Tesla that will give it a price edge. As to quality, I believe Chinese customers will gradually find that the quality of made-in-China cars is no worse, or perhaps even better, than cars made in the US,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The made-in-China Model 3 is priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,595) now, about 8,000 yuan cheaper than its US equivalent.&nbsp;</p>
