<p>Huawei is likely to upgrade its P40 smartphone by adopting graphene technology to expand its battery capacity to upward of 5,000 mAh, so that it can better accommodate the power-guzzling demand of the 5G network, an industry insider told the Global Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Chinese tech giant is expected to launch its P40, successor of the Huawei P30, in the first quarter of next year, according to media reports. The new device will be equipped with the Kirin 990 5G chipset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As battery capacity is one of the key indexes that determine the performance of a 5G smartphone, some bet Huawei -facing a US trade ban that could potentially cut off its supply of US parts and weigh on its overseas sales &#8211; may introduce graphene technology to increase the competiveness of its new devices and appeal to more 5G users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s P30 series is powered by lithium batteries.</p>
<p>Currently, the maximum battery capacity of most smartphones in the market is about 4,000 mAh. US tech firm Apple&#8217;s iPhone Pro Max has a battery capacity of 3,969 mAh &#8211; the biggest battery Apple has ever used in its smartphones.</p>
<p>&#8220;A graphene battery above 5,000 mAh will give Huawei an edge in the increasingly fierce 5G competition, in particular helping it to outstrip foreign rivals,&#8221; Xiang Ligang, an expert on the telecommunications industry, told the Global Times on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The widely expected graphene battery, coupled with Huawei&#8217;s newly developed 50W rapid-charging technology, could take only 45 minutes to charge fully, industry website gizmochina.com reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has seen brisk sales in the third quarter of 2019. It shipped 41.5 million units in China from July to September, up 66 percent year-on-year, according to a report from Canalys.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">China&#8217;s first low-Earth 5G broadband satellite with a high capacity to meet international competition will be launched by Chinese commercial aerospace company Galaxy Space at the end of December, according to a statement sent to the Global Times on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The satellite is the first in China to be built with a capacity of 10 gigabits per second (Gbps), and it will be the world&#8217;s first low-Earth broadband satellite in the Q/V band, an extremely high frequency band, the company said. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The satellite has already been developed and ground tests have been carried out with stable results. Once in place, the satellite will be able to cover an area of 300,000 square kilometers, roughly 50 times the size of Shanghai. It is expected to narrow the technological gap between Chinese companies and US companies Oneweb and SpaceX, who have already deployed low-Earth communications satellites. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is increasingly important for Chinese commercial aerospace companies to achieve high spectrum band resources, alongside the rapid development of global commercial communications satellites, Zhang Shijie, an aerospace expert, told the Global Times on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The broad coverage of low-Earth satellites could mean easier access to internet for people in remote areas, as well as more simultaneous data transmission for time-sensitive professions, including live news broadcasting and trading. </span></p>

<p>The Hong Kong Ocean Park said on Wednesday that its net deficit for the 2018-2019 fiscal year ending June 30 widens to around 557 million Hong Kong dollars (71 million U.S. dollars), more than double of about 237 million (30 million U.S. dollars) in a fiscal year before.</p>
<p>In an annual report of financial results from July last year to June this year, Ocean Park&#8217;s visitor attendances remained stable at 5.7 million, compared with the figure of 5.8 million in 2017-2018 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The Ocean Park saw around 1,734 million Hong Kong dollars (222 million dollars) in revenue, up around 3 percent year-on-year from 1,686 million Hong Kong dollars (216 million dollars) previously, while operating costs increased to over 1,500 million Hong Kong dollars (192 million dollars).</p>

<p>The resort said the net deficit was caused by investments on new entertainment projects, repairs and maintenance expenses on facilities damaged by Typhoon Mangkhut, as well as expenses associated with new infrastructure and facilities.</p>
<p>The park pointed out that it saw a strong local attendance fueled by Hong Kong resident-exclusive promotions and a growth of individual travelers from overseas markets. The growth momentum in local and overseas individual travelers attendances was countered however by the continued decline in tour group tourists attendances which echoed the worldwide trend of personalization in travel, it said.</p>
<p>Chairman of Ocean Park Leo Kung said in the report that the resort was facing fierce competition and increasingly difficult market environment. Despite cost pressures, it&#8217;s mandatory for the park to invest in new infrastructure and entertainment offering to lift guest experience and maintain itself as an entertainment destination and tourism hotspot, he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged after cutting rates at each of the last three meetings, as officials assessed the effect of rate cuts on the US economy.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed&#8217;s policy-making committee, decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent after concluding a two-day policy meeting, in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate,&#8221; the Fed said in a statement, adding that household spending has been rising at a strong pace while business fixed investment and exports remain weak.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate,&#8221; said the statement.</p>

<br />The US economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the third quarter this year, slightly up from the 2-percent growth rate in the second quarter but a sharp deceleration from 3.1 percent in the first quarter, according to the US Commerce Department.</p>
<p>The Fed has lowered interest rates three times since July, amid growing risks and uncertainties stemming from trade tensions, weakness in global growth and muted inflation pressures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our economic outlook remains favorable despite global developments and ongoing risks,&#8221; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;With our decisions through the course of the past year, we believe that monetary policy is well-positioned to serve the American people,&#8221; Powell said, adding the current stance of monetary policy &#8220;likely will remain appropriate&#8221; as long as the US economy stays on track.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The median estimate for the federal funds rate is at 1.6 percent at the end of 2020, suggesting no rate cuts or hikes in 2020, according to Fed officials&#8217; interest rate forecasts released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fed is now quite dovish &amp; given likely alteration of inflation target in 2020 this bodes well for risk assets. Powell just noted how accommodative policy is,&#8221; Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist with RSM US LLP, an audit, tax and consulting firm, tweeted Wednesday afternoon, noting the Fed strongly implied no rate hikes in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The threshold for a rate hike remains much higher than the threshold for a rate cut. Powell underscored that he still saw slack in the economy,&#8221; echoed Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, a major accounting firm, adding she still expects at least one rate cut next year.</p>
<p>However, a majority of the 31 economists recently polled by Bloomberg expect that Fed officials won&#8217;t allow the 2020 presidential election to sway their monetary policy decisions and will keep rates on hold for the next two years.</p>

<p>Steve Dickson, chief of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), said Wednesday that aviation regulators won&#8217;t likely clear Boeing&#8217;s troubled 737 Max airplanes for flight until 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like I said there are a number of processes, milestones, that have to be completed,&#8221; Dickson told CNBC, &#8220;If you just do the math, it&#8217;s going to extend into 2020.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dickson said there is no clear timeline for when the 737 Max will be re-certified and that there are 10 to 11 milestones left to complete before it can be approved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to follow every step of the process, however long that takes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made it clear that I&#8217;m going to support my people and that means they are going to take whatever time it takes to get this process completed and to do it the right way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dickson added that his team is currently in the process of reviewing the plane&#8217;s software and &#8220;the validation of how the software was developed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dickson&#8217;s comments squash any hope that Boeing had of getting the planes re-certified before the end of the year, said a CNBC report.</p>
<p>The return date of the fuel-efficient planes has repeatedly slipped. The uncertainty has been a challenge for airlines like Southwest and American, which have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue with the planes out of service, said the report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese and US enterprises were urged to foster engagement and cooperation at a forum in the Bay Area, despite ongoing trade frictions between the two countries.</p>
<p>Ken Wilcox, chair of Asia Society Northern California, said his organization is in favor of building a better relationship between the United States and China.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not among those who favor decoupling; to the contrary, we favor engagement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Addressing the 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility Forum on Tuesday, Wilcox underscored the importance of engagement and understanding between both peoples and countries by recalling his own experience as the president of a US-China joint venture bank in Shanghai, the financial hub in eastern China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Engagement can lead to greater understanding and greater understanding can lead to further engagement&#8230; understanding each other makes life better and makes it easier to collaborate,&#8221; Wilcox noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Globalization is here, and it&#8217;s here to stay. There is no way we can turn back the clock,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so much (collaboration) ahead of us &#8230; that will be good for China, good for the US and good for the rest of the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The forum, attended by more than 150 Chinese and US business leaders, enterprises, tech executives and investors, was co-hosted by Chinese Enterprise Association-California and Asia Society Northern California.</p>
<p>At the forum, Chinese Consul General in San Francisco Wang Donghua said that businesses from China and the United States have invested heavily in each other&#8217;s countries and have made great contributions to local communities by creating job opportunities, offering more options for local consumers, and increasing tax revenues for local governments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two-way investment between our two countries, by the end of 2018, exceeded 214 billion US dollars,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The investment by Chinese companies in the United States supports 140,000 new American jobs each year on average, Wang said.</p>
<p>He said Tuesday&#8217;s forum was also an opportunity for Chinese and US business leaders to exchange ideas on how to better fulfill their corporate social responsibility, so as to create a better environment for their own businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US technology giant Apple Inc&#8217;s first data center in Guizhou, Southwest China, was officially powered on and entered the commissioning phase on Wednesday, progressing in a fast manner amid the prolonged trade war between the world&#8217;s largest two economies.</p>
<p>The data center, located in Guian, Southwest China&#8217;s Guizhou Province, will be key to providing a iCloud experience for Chinese users. It will reduce delays and improve reliability for users, thereby increasing the overall speed of Apple services in China market.</p>
<p>In order to ensure stable power supply for the data center, the 110-kilovolt transformer substation in the Guian New Area has adopted the dual power supply and dual-cable connection for the first time, according to a report from domestic news site chinanews.com on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Construction of the data center is in the interests of Chinese users and the US company, especially when China and the US have been locked in a trade war for more than one year, Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Apple announced plans to build a data center in Guizhou in July 2017, in compliance with China&#8217;s Cybersecurity Law. The law states that operators of key information infrastructure should store in the Chinese mainland important business and personal data that they collect from their operations in China.</p>
<p>Ma noted that with the fast development of the internet, data sovereignty is being strictly observed by many countries in the world, and &#8220;it&#8217;s a rather reasonable request for countries to ask [companies] to store their users&#8217; data domestically.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jointly built by Apple and Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Co, the facility, with a budget of $1 billion, began construction in March last year and is expected to open for business in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple also announced in February last year plans to build another data center in Ulanqab City in North China&#8217;s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which will be put into operation in 2020 and offer iCloud services on the Chinese mainland, according to the local government.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decision to build two data centers in China is not only a result of its large user base in the country, but is also in line with its own need to prevent risks as the trade war brings more uncertainty to its businesses in China, Ma said.</p>
<p>&#8220;To cope with the unpredictable situation, the best thing for Apple to do is to operate separately and store separately when running its businesses in different places around the world,&#8221; Ma said.</p>

<p>The latest US defense-policy bill barring the use of state funds to buy Chinese buses and rail cars has triggered strong dissatisfaction among targeted Chinese companies. Some warned that such way of suppressing Chinese companies could lead to the loss of hundreds of jobs in the US, crippling US&#8217; competitiveness and inflicting massive harm on the US economy.</p>
<p>The unfair decision, &#8220;crafted from special interests,&#8221; could &#8220;squash competition in the electric bus sector … and undercut the US&#8217; [efforts] against climate change,&#8221; new energy vehicle (NEV) maker BYD, one of the Chinese firms affected by the bill, said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The US House of Representatives and Senate Republicans and Democrats have agreed on the language for the National Defense Authorization Act, the Wall Street Journal reported. Under the legislation which is expected to pass this week, Washington will ban the use of federal funds to purchase buses and passenger rail cars made by Chinese manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US subsidiaries of Shenzhen-based BYD and rail giant CRRC Corporation will be affected by the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BYD, which is one of the three major electric bus manufacturers in the US, described the decision as &#8220;a slap in the face&#8221; to union workers in the US electric vehicle sector. But the NEV-maker stressed that the bill won&#8217;t affect private clients that don&#8217;t use federal dollars for their purchases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final bill includes a two-year delay on implementation, according to media reports. BYD said it will continue to grow its business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CRRC had not responded to the Global Times&#8217; interview request as of press time. The firm has won contracts to supply subway cars in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. Some reports estimate those deals could be worth $2.7 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese observers pointed out that the defense bill is another example of how Washington resorted to bullying tactics to assault Chinese firms, after launching a bid to batter Huawei Technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Electric buses and rail cars are transportation methods for civil purposes. How could the US government justify the bill with so-called &#8216;national security concerns?'&#8221; Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gao stressed that such a move &#8211; flouting global economic rules and disrupting the global industrial chain &#8211; &#8220;is destined to&#8221; weigh on the US&#8217; flagging economy and hurt its domestic consumers&#8217; legitimate interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation purchased 130 all-electric buses from BYD, marking the largest order of electronic buses in US history. The Chinese company has created 1,000 jobs since entering the US market in 2013.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The trading floor of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in Shanghai Photo: CFP</p>
<p>The IPO of Postal Savings Bank of China (PSBC), which has roughly 40,000 outlets nationwide and more than 600 million individual customers, met with a muted response when it began trading on Tuesday, underpinned by rarely used price-stabilization measures taken by the nation&#8217;s fifth-largest lender by assets.</p>
<p>Shares of PSBC opened at 5.6 yuan ($0.8) in Shanghai on Tuesday, versus an IPO price of 5.5 yuan. The shares closed up 2 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PSBC was the top gainer in the banking sector, which shed 0.63 percent on Tuesday. The key Shanghai Composite Index finished up 0.1 percent at 2,917.32 points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A greenshoe option, or overallotment option, was attached to PSBC&#8217;s IPO, making the bank the fourth ever in the A-share market to use that mechanism, Wu Jinduo, head of fixed income at the research institute of Great Wall Securities, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The previous three were Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Everbright Bank. PSBC&#8217;s IPO would be the largest in nearly a decade in the A-share market, if the option is exercised in full.</p>
<p>The greenshoe mechanism allows for the offering size to be increased by a maximum of 15 percent during the first 30 days of trading. If the bank&#8217;s shares fall below its IPO price, the option allocated for underwriters would be exercised, funneling more money into the market to stabilize the price and thereby protecting investors, Wu said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, PSBC&#8217;s parent China Post Group, the bank itself and some executives would increase their stakes in the bank, if its shares in Shanghai fall below the latest audited net asset value per share for 20 consecutive trading days during the first three years of trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the bank said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange over the weekend that its parent company planned to invest at least 2.5 billion yuan to increase its holding in the banking subsidiary during the 12 months starting from the IPO day.</p>
<p>The overallotment option and plans to increase stakes ostensibly helped in offering stability and liquidity to the new issue. But they also signal that there&#8217;s pressure on bank listings, according to Wu.</p>
<p>PSBC&#8217;s first-day performance pales in comparison with easy bets on A-share market debuts, which normally jump 30-40 percent on their first day of trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The small gain on the first day was also reminiscent of the IPO of Zheshang Bank in late November. Shares of the Hangzhou-based lender closed up a mere 0.6 percent on its debut in Shanghai before falling below the offer price on the following day.</p>
<p>PSBC&#8217;s Shanghai listing followed its Hong Kong IPO in September 2016. Its H shares closed unchanged at HK$5.21 ($0.67) on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
