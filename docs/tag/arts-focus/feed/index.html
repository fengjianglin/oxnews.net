<p>The upcoming latest episode of reality show<br />
<em>Encounter,</em> which will be made available on Tencent Video on Tuesday, will see Chinese musicians Aya, Tan Weiwei and Xiao He collect children&#8217;s folk songs in local dialects in Hangzhou and other neighboring areas in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passed down by word of mouth through the generations, children&#8217;s songs in local dialects are facing extinction due to rapid urbanization and social changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the show, the musicians seek out the original songs and then remake them&nbsp; to fit today&#8217;s modern times in order to remind people of the long-unheard voices of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second season of the show currently has a high rating of 7.6/10 on Chinese media review site Douban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s director Zhao Qi said that the second season, which kicked off on October 22, will &#8220;return to humanity itself.&#8221; The first season once raised questions about life and death, topics commonly discussed by many families.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy 19th birthday, and hope you are happy every day!&#8221; Roy Wang (Wang Yuan), a member of Chinese boy band TFBoys, sent out birthday wishes exactly at midnight on Thursday on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below the text was a photo of Jackson Yee, who is also part of the three-member boy band. In the picture, the smiling Yee holds a photoshopped cake in his hand, apparently, the work of Wang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four minutes later, Karry Wang (Wang Junkai), another member of the band, posted, &#8220;Happy 19th birthday, hope every day in the future goes well and is filled with happiness. Hope you can do more things that you love.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his post, Karry Wang attached a photo of Yee enjoying hot pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the same thread, Karry Wang later posted, &#8220;Due to a delay in the network in Switzerland, I failed to send out birthday wishes right on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wang&#8217;s birthday wishes drew Chinese netizen&#8217;s attention. Related hashtags have earned 320 million views and 61,000 posts in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debuting in 2013, the three have been working together for about six years. As the trio have transformed from ordinary teens to China&#8217;s most influential stars, they have appeared less frequently on stage together as they have gradually shifted focus to their individual careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wang is currently studying music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, while Karry Wang is attending the Beijing Film Academy. As for Yee, who is studying at the Central Academy of Drama, he recently gained huge success with his first film role in the coming-of-age drama<br />
<em>Better Days</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Chinese fans also sent out their own birthday wishes, they were warmed by the trio&#8217;s display of friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The relationship among the three &#8211; Karry Wang, Roy Wang and Jackson Yee &#8211; is a kind of brotherhood. They are still so close to each other!&#8221; one netizen wrote in a post on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Russian cheeses on sale at a shop Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Elvira Kovtun made her first cheese in a pot in her kitchen four years ago.</p>
<p>Kovtun, a housewife and mostly self-taught cheesemaker, became so good that she and her husband decided to turn her passion into a business.</p>
<p>Last month, the high-school sweethearts and parents of three became the first Russians to win a gold prize at the World Cheese Awards, with their &#8220;Peshernyi&#8221; hard cheese taking the honor at the industry&#8217;s equivalent of the Oscars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think this was possible,&#8221; Elvira&#8217;s husband, Vyacheslav Kovtun, told AFP at their small creamery in the industrial town of Korolyov, outside Moscow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I believe in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family&#8217;s success shows how far Russia&#8217;s cheese-making industry has come since President Vladimir Putin banned Western food imports in 2014 in a tit-for-tat measure over the<br />
<a href="http://backup.globaltimes.cn/SPECIALCOVERAGE/Ukrainecrisis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukraine crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Many Russians had developed a taste for French and Italian cheeses prior to sanctions, and Moscow seized the opportunity to put in place an &#8220;import substitution&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>This supported local entrepreneurs trying to set up businesses to replace imported goods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results were often mixed, however, with many customers complaining of the higher price and often inferior quality of the Russian-made products.</p>
<p>But dairy farming and cheese-making have become a bright spot.</p>
<p>According to Russia&#8217;s National Association of Milk Producers, production of cheese and cheese products grew by a third to 670,000 tons a year between 2013 and 2018.</p>
<p>Last week Putin confessed he was &#8220;somewhat worried&#8221; when the first punitive measures were introduced, but the events of the past few years proved that the sanctions had worked to &#8220;our economy&#8217;s advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Ground-breaking&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of artisanal creameries have cropped up across the country and some, like the Kovtuns, are winning top marks from international critics.</p>
<p>Elvira and Vyacheslav, who are both 40 and opened their Korolyov creamery in 2018, had not expected success to come so quickly.</p>
<p>When Elvira called her husband to break the news of the award last month, she was sobbing, Vyacheslav said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got scared. I thought something terrible had happened,&#8221; he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Their creamery&#8217;s website crashed from interest after the awards were announced and the winning cheese sold out until April 2020.</p>
<p>More than 3,800 cheeses from 42 countries were in competition at this year&#8217;s World Cheese Awards in Bergamo, Italy, where products are awarded with supergold, gold, silver or bronze prizes.</p>
<p>At last year&#8217;s competition no Russian entries were recognized but this year the Kovtuns&#8217; Cheese &amp; Beer creamery and three other Russian cheesemakers won a total of nine awards.</p>
<p>John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food which organizes the competition, said the Kovtuns had put Russia on the international cheese map.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our gold winners are some of the best in the world and only a small percentage of entries do this well,&#8221; Farrand said, praising their Peshernyi cheese for &#8220;delivering a true sense of terroir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Russia&#8217;s lack of the cheese-making heritage of France or Italy could in some ways be an advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Free from the pressures of tradition, the country&#8217;s artisans can innovate and produce something ground-breaking and unique,&#8221; Farrand said in written comments to AFP.</p>
<p>Elvira said she spent several years perfecting Peshernyi and the recipe is a closely guarded secret.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Cheese fever&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>With its nutty and fruity hints, Peshernyi matures for seven months in a cellar and sells for 1,800 rubles ($28) a kilogram.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t last a day without cheese,&#8221; Elvira said, placing curd grains in moulds with the help of an assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are all my babies. I love them.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kovtuns now make 20 soft and hard varieties including camembert and truffle brie, employing a handful of staff.</p>
<p>They produce cheeses five days a week but demand far outstrips supply.</p>
<p>Yevgeny Barabanshchikov, a chef and connoisseur of European cheeses who traditionally shunned Russian-made dairy products, went to meet the Kovtuns as soon as he learned of their success in Bergamo.</p>
<p>&#8220;My interest is professional,&#8221; said Barabanshchikov, executive chef at Integrita, a top supplier of high-quality imported food.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very pleased for them because I know the cheese-making technology,&#8221; Barabanshchikov told AFP, stressing that hard cheeses require a lot of investment, expertise and good-quality milk.</p>
<p>One of the people who has most championed the Kovtuns is their competitor Oleg Sirota, arguably Russia&#8217;s best-known cheesemaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more good creameries we have, the more people will trust us,&#8221; said the 31-year-old head of the Union of Russian Cheesemakers.</p>
<p>He himself took his first gold at a regional competition in France in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sirota recalled how Vyacheslav, who owned a construction firm at the time, ambushed him at a gas station outside Moscow in 2016, saying he wanted to learn the business of cheese-making and was ready to sell his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was stunned,&#8221; Sirota said.</p>
<p>They now help each other, plan to expand their operations and praise Putin for creating what Sirota calls Russia&#8217;s &#8220;cheese fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vyacheslav said Russia&#8217;s modern cheesemakers are continuing a long tradition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not inventing anything new,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We made a lot of cheese a hundred years ago and exported it to Europe and the Baltics. We are now reviving our forefathers&#8217; recipes.&#8221;</p>

<p>K-pop powerhouse EXO&#8217;s sixth album<br />
<em>Obsession</em> was finally released at 5 pm on Wednesday, which was also band member Chanyeol&#8217;s birthday.</p>
<p>The hashtag &#8220;OBSESSEDwithEXO&#8221; topped the trending list on Twitter in many countries including Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand after the K-pop icons released a music video teaser and posters for the album at 11 am that same day.</p>
<p>Prior to the release, hundreds of thousands of Chinese netizens took to social media to express their anticipation for the upcoming album as well as wish Chanyeol a happy birthday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;EXO will always continue to stay on top due to their talent and hard work. They have gained so many prizes at different award ceremonies and will keep shinning on the stage all the time,&#8221; wrote one Chinese netizen on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monster Byun Baek-hyun really comes for all of our necks in the best possible way, and we love to see it,&#8221; another netizen commented on the platform.</p>
<p>The album is expected to be a global hit since it was produced by several well-known South Korean and international musicians including US musician and producer Dem Jointz, British production team LDN Noise, the Joombas music group and South Korean singer-songwriter and record producer Yoo Young-jin.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A cup of sake Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The sommelier lingers over her glass, taking in the bouquet while clutching a spoon of caviar and cucumber jelly. The union of food and beverage is &#8220;magical&#8221;, she declares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Paz Levinson, head sommelier at the high-end Anne-Sophie Pic restaurant group, is not savoring a sought-after vintage from Bordeaux or Bourgogne. She is holding a glass of sake, the humble Japanese rice drink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sake works very well with French cuisine,&#8221; says the Argentine.</p>
<p>France is only the 11th largest market in the world for sake, where the total sales remain below two million euros ($2.2 million) per year. But its consumption is soaring, with imports increased by some 160 percent between 2012 and 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anne-Sophie Pic, the head chef and owner of the eponymous restaurant group has won eight Michelin stars in her career, and she is a sake convert. She first used the drink in her recipes before adding it to the wine list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other hotels and restaurants are equally keen.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>&#8216;Sake boom&#8217;</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p></strong>In a growing market, entrepreneurs have sniffed an opportunity &#8212; French sake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two companies already produce the drink domestically &#8212; both in wine-growing regions. Takuma Inagawa, a French-educated Japanese brewer, has a different idea. He wants to start production in an old warehouse in Fresnes, a town just south of Paris.</p>
<p>Despite his Japanese heritage and the industrial surroundings of Fresnes, he is keen to imbue the drink with the best French traditions. &#8220;We wanted local, French rice,&#8221; says Inagawa, whose warehouse holds hundreds of bags marked &#8220;Camargue rice&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The French are ready to accept sake but, with the trend towards a sustainable environment, there is a potential for French sake,&#8221; says the 31-year-old, whose company Wakaze was set up in Japan making flavored versions of the alcohol.</p>
<p>He hopes eventually to use Burgundy oak barrels to age some of his product &#8212; believing this will please French and Japanese drinkers, as he has already produced a run of 17,000 bottles in his homeland.</p>
<p>Sake began to get popular in France about 15 or 20 years ago, according to expert Sylvain Huet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He says a &#8220;sushi boom&#8221; led to a &#8220;sake boom&#8221; in the restaurants and dining rooms on Rue Sainte-Anne, a Parisian street near the Louvre known as Little Tokyo because of the proliferation of Japanese businesses.</p>
<p>But the impact was initially limited to that small area of Paris.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Sake &#8216;evangelist&#8217;</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huet though believes France has got a taste for the drink: &#8220;Over the next 10 years, the market in France will increase fivefold, even tenfold,&#8221; he predicts.</p>
<p>Huet set up his own Sake Fair in 2014 and says he catered to over 5,100 visitors in this year&#8217;s edition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, sommelier Xavier Thuizat has also been enchanted by the drink, establishing his own tasting competition &#8212; &#8220;Kura Master&#8221; &#8212; in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He says he hit an impasse six years ago, unable to find the right drink to go with certain foods.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find the solution,&#8221; he explains, adding that despite coming from the wine-producing region of Burgundy, France&#8217;s famous drop just did not cut it.</p>
<p>Then a Japanese man told him to try sake, which set him on a path to becoming an &#8220;evangelist&#8221; for the Japanese drink.</p>
<p>While these French enthusiasts treat sake as a high-end product for gastronomes &#8212; that is not the case for everyone.</p>
<p>The word sake in Japanese is generic, referring to many types of alcohol. And sake has also been adopted by Chinese brewers as a useful label for their cheap sorghum brandy.</p>
<p>But the French converts are sanguine. &#8220;I now bring sake as a gift when I go back to Burgundy,&#8221; says sommelier Thuizat. &#8220;The reactions are good.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">An app store featuring the Netflix app Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Streaming giant Netflix will use New York&#8217;s historic Paris theater, which had been shuttered earlier this year, for special events and screenings of its films &#8211; the latest twist in the company&#8217;s ongoing spat with the traditional film industry.</p>
<p>The theater &#8211; the city&#8217;s last single screen movie house, located in the heart of Manhattan on 57th Street, not far from Central Park and the Plaza hotel &#8211; closed in late August after 71 years in business.</p>
<p>It had reopened in early November for what seemed like a one-off event &#8211; a limited theatrical run for Netflix&#8217;s Oscar contender<br />
<em>Marriage Story</em> by New York director Noah Baumbach.</p>
<p>But it would seem that Netflix had bigger plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, the iconic theater will be kept open and become a home for special Netflix events, screenings, and theatrical releases,&#8221; the company said Monday in a series of Twitter messages.</p>
<p>The details of the deal were not disclosed, but industry site Deadline Hollywood said it was a 10-year lease agreement.</p>
<p>Netflix has been in a low-grade battle with traditional Hollywood for some time over the Oscar eligibility requirements that films in contention run in regular theaters for a certain period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But many major theater chains have refused to deal with Netflix unless it consents to longer runs of its films &#8211; and a longer waiting period between any film&#8217;s theatrical release and its streaming debut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, the waiting period generally agreed upon by studios and the major chains is 90 days.</p>
<p>That means Netflix has relied thus far on indie movie houses for its releases, but the leasing of the Paris theater would seem to mark a new phase in its strategy.</p>
<p>For months, it has reportedly been in talks to buy the historic Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.</p>
<p>On Monday, Deadline Hollywood reported that Netflix had indeed acquired a majority stake in that Los Angeles venue, but Netflix has yet to confirm the deal.</p>
<p>The Paris theater opened in 1948, when screen legend Marlene Dietrich cut the ribbon. It turned into one of the country&#8217;s most notable art house theaters, focusing on films often ignored by multiplexes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Visitors take photos in a balloon room at the Supercandy pop-up museum on October 5, 2018 in Cologne, Germany. Photo: AFP</p>
<p>Crammed into a supermarket trolley, Kiki Malliora squealed with laughter as she rolled past her sister at Cologne&#8217;s pop-up selfie museum, where visitors said having fun outweighs the hunt for &#8220;likes&#8221; in a changing social media landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, the setting is fake,&#8221; said the 38-year-old office administrator, dressed in a black crop T-shirt and jeans.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what matters to me is that the picture is real and that people can see I&#8217;m having a good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>With its bubblegum-pink balloons, neon-colored ball pits and retro American diner as eye-popping, ready-made photographic backdrops, the Supercandy Museum is an Instagrammer&#8217;s dream.</p>
<p>But the attraction&#8217;s three-month run comes as a new wave of social media users prize authenticity over staged photos, and celebrity influencers are increasingly honest about the effort that goes into keeping up a picture-perfect feed.</p>
<p>US singer Demi Lovato attracted almost 10 million Instagram &#8220;likes&#8221; when she posted an unedited bikini shot revealing her cellulite, while Hollywood actress Drew Barrymore showed herself crying on a &#8220;difficult and not so pretty&#8221; day.</p>
<p>Instagram is even experimenting with making the &#8220;like&#8221; button invisible in response to concerns over its mental health impact.</p>
<p>Critics say younger users especially report feeling anxious or self-conscious if their posts don&#8217;t perform well.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;A lot of work&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When I see those elaborately staged pictures, I just think: &#8216;God, that must have taken a lot of work,'&#8221; said Malliora.</p>
<p>Her younger sister Nathalie, who keeps her Instagram account private for pre-approved followers only to see any uploaded photos and videos she shares, nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Pop-up attractions like the one in Cologne have sprung up across the globe in recent years, offering anyone armed with a smartphone a plethora of brashly-colored, playful settings to liven up their social media presence.</p>
<p>The Supercandy Museum returned to the western German city this month after a previous six-month stint drew over 42,000 mainly female visitors, with full-price tickets costing 29 euros ($32).</p>
<p>The man behind Supercandy, Frank Karch, said ticket sales were &#8220;noticeably up&#8221; for the second edition, this time located in an industrial building in the city&#8217;s hip Ehrenfeld district.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eventually this craze too will run its course,&#8221; he told AFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the emergence of creators championing unfiltered, real-life pictures isn&#8217;t a threat to his business model, he said, arguing that social media was diversifying so much that there was a niche for everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The overarching mega-trend will stay the same it has been since the invention of painting: wanting to have a nice picture of yourself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Pink cash</strong></p>
<p>Social media expert Klemens Skibicki, a professor at the Cologne Business School, agreed but said the gulf was widening between those who see social media as a hobby, and those who use it as a tool to promote themselves or a brand &#8211; with some influencers earning enough to quit their day jobs.</p>
<p>Eschewing &#8220;selfies,&#8221; which anyone can take, influencers tend to opt more for &#8220;posies&#8221; taken by someone else, often a professional photographer, he said, to keep their posts looking polished and aspirational.</p>
<p>At Supercandy, German reality TV couple Ginger Costello Wollersheim and Bert Wollersheim &#8211; who have 85,000 followers between them &#8211; played with piles of pink $100 bills as their photographer snapped away.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t post good pictures for a while, you get fewer likes and people unfollow. So we&#8217;re here to make beautiful, creative photos,&#8221; said Ginger, 33, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>Her long-haired husband Bert, a regular feature in Germany&#8217;s tabloid press, said they weren&#8217;t &#8220;fanatical&#8221; about chasing &#8220;likes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming here is fun, it changes our story up a bit and that&#8217;s good for us professionally,&#8221; added the 68-year-old, clad in shades and sparkly trainers.</p>
<p>But not everyone could see the appeal of what is essentially a giant photo studio.</p>
<p>Chatting with her friends in a busy Cologne shopping street, high school student Anna-Maria cringed at the thought of forking out money to pose against an artificial backdrop.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s way too fake. I prefer spontaneous snapshots, where someone is laughing or in the middle of doing something,&#8221; the 17-year-old said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;d only post a selfie if my friends were in it too.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Promotional material of <em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> Photo: IC</p>
<p>As Disney&#8217;s<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> was topping the North American pre-Thanksgiving weekend box office with a record $127 million debut, it also swept the Chinese mainland box office by taking in 341.4 million yuan ($48.5 million) over its opening weekend, according to Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan.</p>
<p>Released on Friday in North America, the film is a sequel to the original<br />
<em>Frozen</em> which hit the theater in 2013, an Oscar-winner, crowned with best animated film and best original song. &#8220;Let It Go&#8221;, its award-winning song has also gained global popularity and been translated into several different languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to deadline.com,<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> has claimed the record for the highest global opening weekend for an animated film. Disney is reporting that the film has brought in $350.2 million worldwide, beating out previous record-holder Toy Story 4&#8217;s $240.9 million opening back in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moviegoers have naturally taken to debate whether the sequel is better than the original.</p>
<p><em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> currently has a 7.3/10 on Chinese media review website Douban from more than 74,000 reviews, while the original has an 8.3/10 from 453,000 reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding which one is better, the opinions among Chinese audiences are divided, with the question itself sparking great debate on Douban.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a top-rated review, Douban user VictorZou originally gave the film a 7/10 after watching the midnight screening on Friday, saying it was a far cry from the first one. Later that same day, the author updated the review giving the film an 8/10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;After a whole day&#8217;s discussion with Douban users, I found that I was being too harsh. I became a Disney fan because of<br />
<em>Frozen</em>, so it was unavoidable for me to have too many expectations for<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>. Maybe it&#8217;s not a perfect sequel, but as a Disney animated film, the production quality is for sure top-notch. The surprising visual effects, the familiar dancing and singing, the attention to detail, these strengths cannot be denied.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another highly-rated review, Douban user Lu Guanjun noted that the songs in the sequel may not be as catchy as &#8220;Let It Go&#8221; and &#8220;Do You Want to Build a Snowman&#8221; from the first film, but the film did a far better job when it came to the storytelling and hitting the audience in the feelings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may like<br />
<em>Frozen</em> better, or maybe you prefer<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>, but one thing you can be sure of is that the sequel is worth checking out,&#8221; concluded Lu.</p>
<p><strong>Controversy in South Korea<br /></strong><br />
<br />A day ahead of China and the US,<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> was released in South Korea. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film boasts the third-biggest industry opening of any movie in South Korea ($31.5 million). While the film&#8217;s commercial success is sure to make theater owners happy, its dominance in cinemas has film industry insiders worried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday morning, several South Korean filmmakers called an emergency press conference in Seoul, urging people to be cautious about the monopolization of the film industry, according to a report from South Korean media outlet Mydaily.</p>
<p>South Korean director Chung Ji-young reiterated the importance of market fairness at the press conference. He pointed out that after the release of<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> in South Korea, the daily screen seat quota for his recent work<br />
<em>Black Money</em>, which came out on November 13, had been reduced from 900,000 to 300,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The decrease happened within a day. I am making an appeal against such unfair phenomenon,&#8221; said Chung.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The director noted that he was aware that such an appeal could cause a backlash against<br />
<em>Black Money</em>, but it would be worth the sacrifice if it drew people&#8217;s attention to fairness within the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The filmmakers at the press conference pointed out that their intention was not to attack<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>, but rather to address a long-standing issue within the industry. They also suggested that relevant laws and policies should be implemented to prevent monopolies, rather than relying on the cinemas and film production companies to solve the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Rescue,&#8221; a new disaster film by award-winning director Dante Lam, is set for release in China on Jan. 25, 2020, the Chinese Lunar New Year&#8217;s Day, according to the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Association.</p>
<p>The film depicts the bravery of a maritime emergency response team leader starring Eddie Peng and his co-workers who rush to the rescue after a severe maritime accident occurs.</p>
<p>Lam, a winner of the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Director, over the weekend won the 32nd China Film Golden Rooster Award for best director for the blockbuster film &#8220;Operation Red Sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Operation Red Sea,&#8221; released in China in February 2018, grossed 3.65 billion yuan (about 518 million U.S. dollars) in total tickets revenue at box office.&nbsp;</p>

Photo: IC</p>
<p>A high-level forum on art development was held on Saturday in Quanzhou, East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, a city widely seen as the starting point of the ancient Maritime<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/ReportsfromtheSilkRoad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silk Road</a>.</p>
<p>Focusing on exchanges and mutual learning between Chinese and foreign arts and civilizations, the forum was part of the ongoing Maritime Silk Road International Art Festival.</p>
<p>Participants at the forum, including some 140 researchers and artists from around the world, voiced the shared view that the spirit of the Silk Road, which represents peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit, should be upheld in developing art and culture.</p>
<p>Addressing the opening ceremony, Zhu Qi, an official with the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/22.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Culture</a> and Tourism, said enhanced cultural exchange could forge stronger people-to-people bonds and build stronger public support for advancing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</p>
<p>Suzanne Ogge, a Singapore-based specialist with the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, acknowledged the positive effect made by the forum in a world that seems to be splintering and where many communities and traditional relationships seem to be splitting apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is incredibly positive to bring people together from so many different countries and from China to discuss ways on a larger scale, where social, economic and cultural cooperation can take place with such peaceful objectives,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tian Qing, a researcher with the China Central Institute for Culture and History and a renowned musician, highlighted the idea of &#8220;harmony in diversity&#8221; in traditional Chinese culture and noted that cultural dialogues under the BRI are not seeking to replace one culture with another, but to foster exchange and mutual learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;People can see themselves from the eyes of other people,&#8221; said Mohammad Aljaloos, also curator of the CAB Art Gallery.</p>
<p>Mychael Barrat, president of the London-based Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers, also shared his experience in creating a narrative map of the Silk Road based on intensive research.</p>
<p>The making of the map has been an adventure in its own right and has inspired him to greater ambition both in printmaking and in his travels, according to Barrat.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Silk Road is a destination for exploration and international dialogue that exists as much as a promise of the future as a relic of the past,&#8221; he said.</p>
