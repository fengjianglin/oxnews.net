<p>Rafael Nadal admitted he gave everything he had left to lead Spain to their sixth Davis Cup success on Sunday after they beat Canada in the final in Madrid.</p>
<p>Nadal&#8217;s 6-3, 7-6 (9/7) victory over Shapovalov confirmed another triumph for Spain ­after Roberto Bautista Agut had earlier seen off Felix Auger-­Aliassime 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.</p>
<p>All five of Spain&#8217;s squad played a part over the course of the week but Nadal&#8217;s colossal effort in front of the home fans at the Caja Magica proved the difference.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old won eight out of eight rubbers, including two in the singles and doubles in a pulsating win over Britain on Saturday and then the decisive match that clinched the title against Shapovalov.</p>
<p>&#8220;I played one of the toughest possible opponents at the end of a long and difficult week, physically too because I put into this whole event all the energy that I had inside me,&#8221; said Nadal. &#8220;Honestly it&#8217;s the perfect end to the season for all of us. We know how difficult it is to win this and how difficult it will be to win it again. We knew we had to convert this opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feliciano Lopez, who played alongside Nadal during Spain&#8217;s doubles win against Britain&#8217;s Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski on Saturday, said Nadal had been a &#8220;superhero.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are things you can&#8217;t describe with words,&#8221; said ­Lopez. &#8220;The things he produced in doubles yesterday and then today against Shapovalov are things only Rafa can do.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ask me for my opinion, I will tell you he is a super-hero. He can do things none of us can do. He is a great person and an extraordinary tennis player.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of his win, Nadal hoisted up Bautista Agut, who had returned to the team after withdrawing on Thursday due to the death of his father Joaquin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very difficult,&#8221; Bautista Agut said. &#8220;I took the decision to go home on Thursday morning and I was back yesterday afternoon to support the team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had the opportunity to play today because all the team and all the players and the rest of the team have made an unbelievable effort since the first day. It was an amazing feeling on the court.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canada were playing in their first ever final in the 119-year-old competition and with Shapovalov and Auger-Aliassime, aged 20 and 19 respectively, their Davis Cup prospects look strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tennis is really hot right now in Canada,&#8221; said Canada&#8217;s team captain Frank Dancevic. &#8220;It&#8217;s really wonderful to see this young generation is playing so well. We have a really bright future ahead of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Canadian team are amazing,&#8221; added Nadal. &#8220;Probably they are going to be one of those teams that will be almost unbeatable in the next couple of years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique insisted on Saturday the inaugural Davis Cup Finals in Madrid have been an &#8220;absolute success,&#8221; although he did admit some changes would have to be made in future.</p>
<p>The controversial week-long finals were launched by Pique&#8217;s investment company Kosmos, replacing the old World Group which saw teams play each other in longer ties spread across the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The competition is an absolute success,&#8221; Pique told broadcasters Movistar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing is that it has a soul&#8230; The players have reactions that they don&#8217;t even have in the Grand Slams.&#8221;</p>
<p>There have been some issues at the Caja Magica, with low attendances for many matches, while Wednesday&#8217;s group-stage tie between the United States and Italy ended at 4:04 am local time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is the base and from there it will grow a lot,&#8221; added Pique.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are going to be retouched, obviously. The issue of the schedules must be retouched. But that&#8217;s what happens to events when the format is changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pique arrived at the Caja Magica to watch Spain&#8217;s semifinal against Britain after playing in Barcelona&#8217;s 2-1 win over Leganes earlier on Saturday.</p>

<p>Novak Djokovic has called on the Davis Cup to merge with the ATP Cup in the future and believes home ties should return in the early rounds of the tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 119-year-old Davis Cup is making its first appearance in its new format in Madrid, where 18 countries are competing for the prestigious trophy in one venue and across a single week.</p>
<p>Under the previous system, a winning team would have to play four weekends across the year and top players were increasingly dropping out, deeming the demands too high in an already-congested tennis calendar.&nbsp; But the changes have proven controversial, not least because the ATP, which runs the men&#8217;s tour, is launching its own international tournament in Australia, less than six weeks after this year&#8217;s Davis Cup ends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scheduling was always an issue for both the ATP Cup and Davis Cup,&#8221; Djokovic said Wednesday, after helping Serbia beat Japan with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Yoshihito Nishioka.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion the idea, if it could happen, was the merge between the two and I think it&#8217;s still open for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking long-term, I personally don&#8217;t think that the two events can co-exist six weeks apart. It&#8217;s just a little bit too congested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The most ideal time of the year is after the US Open, probably at the end of September, that would be the best time to have this super cup, whatever, one cup, hopefully in the future.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But holding either tournament after the US Open will prove difficult given that week already carries the Laver Cup, the competition promoted by Roger Federer&#8217;s management company Team8, contested between Europe and a Rest of the World team.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Stefanos Tsitsipas returns to Dominic Thiem in the ATP World Tour Finals on November 17 in London. Photo: IC</p>
<p>Rafael Nadal will end the year as the world&#8217;s top-ranked player and the &#8220;big three&#8221; retained their stranglehold on the Grand Slam titles, but when Stefanos Tsitsipas was crowned ATP Finals champion last weekend it felt like a watershed moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;m really close on being crowned a Grand Slam champion. I know these are strong words that I say, but I do feel like I belong to be there,&#8221; the 21-year-old Greek boldly claimed after beating Dominic Thiem.</p>
<p>There have been false dawns before of course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s Alexander Zverev, like Greek Tsitsipas, was also 21 last year when he beat Novak Djokovic to win the season-ender in London.</p>
<p>Zverev could not back it up in this year&#8217;s Slams, two of which were won by the 33-year-old Nadal and two by the 32-year-old Djokovic. They have 19 and 16 majors each while Roger Federer, at 38, will still believe he can add to the record 20 he has accumulated during his extraordinary career.</p>
<p>But for the first time, that golden trio will be having an anxious glance over their shoulders. The past week in London has revealed a new fearlessness in the generation of 20 somethings expected to fill the void when they call it a day.</p>
<p>Austrian Thiem, who at 26 is an established force, got the ball rolling when he beat Federer on the opening day of the ATP&#8217;s exclusive year-ender.</p>
<p>The following day Germany&#8217;s Zverev beat Nadal for the first time in his career while earlier that day Tsitsipas marked his tournament debut by beating 23-year-old Russian Daniil Medvedev, who reached this year&#8217;s US Open final, for the first time</p>
<p>It did not stop there. Thiem then beat Djokovic and Medvedev should have beaten Nadal, losing from 5-1 up in the decider.</p>
<p>On November 16, Tsitsipas silenced the Federer fan club to eclipse the six-time champion in straight sets to reach the final &#8211; beating the Swiss maestro with the kind of attacking game Federer has trademarked.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Missing trio</span></strong></p>
<p>With Nadal and Djokovic bumped out in the group, Federer&#8217;s semifinal defeat meant it was only the third time since 2002 that at least one of that trio had not reached the final.</p>
<p>That may have disappointed some, but the quality and intensity of last weekend&#8217;s final in which Tsitsipas beat Thiem 6-7 (6), 6-2, 7-6 (4) to become the youngest champion at the season-ending tournament since 2001, had the O2 Arena audience enthralled.</p>
<p>With the likes of Medvedev and fellow Russians Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev, Canadian duo Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov, Australia Alex de Minaur and Italians Matteo Berrettini and Jannik Sinner, not to mention German Zverev, gathering en masse, change is brewing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that for sure we can do it next year. We are all playing great tennis,&#8221; Thiem said. &#8220;Sascha [Zverev], Stefanos, me, some other guys. I&#8217;m pretty sure that we&#8217;re going to see a new and young Grand Slam champion next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tsitsipas wisely pointed out, however, that over best-of-five-set matches, beating the big three remains a massive challenge, even if he did down Federer in Australia.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a really difficult task to do for players,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For us, for the young guys, it&#8217;s all about time.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the evidence of the past seven days the waiting game may be about to come to an end.&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Davis Cup has a new format but Andy Murray&#8217;s love of a comeback remains intact after the Scot battled from behind to beat Tallon Griekspoor on Wednesday as Great Britain edged past Holland.</p>
<p>Murray came from a set down and then trailed 4-1 in the decider in Madrid before beating the spirited Griekspoor, ranked 179 in the world, 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 7-6 (7/5).</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found a way to win matches many times in my ­career when I&#8217;ve not been playing well,&#8221; Murray said. &#8220;You can draw on that a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>A scrappy victory gave Great Britain the lead in their opening Group E tie and while Dan Evans lost the second singles rubber to Robin Haase, Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski finished the job in the doubles.</p>
<p>Rafael Nadal won his 26th consecutive Davis Cup singles match later on Wednesday as Spain booked their place in the quarterfinals with a 3-0 victory over defending champions Croatia.</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, cruised past Yoshihito Nishioka to help Serbia beat Japan by the same scoreline.</p>
<p>Murray had given short shrift on Tuesday to those he believes have been too quick to criticize the revamped Davis Cup, which for the first time is featuring all 18 World Group countries competing for the trophy across a single week in one venue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in what will be music to the ears of the organizers, among them Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique, Murray was full of praise for the atmosphere inside the Caja Magica&#8217;s cosy Stadium 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The atmosphere was brilliant,&#8221; Murray said afterward. &#8220;That was the one concern I had about the event, about it being on neutral ground, but it was great.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>British fans have been second only to Spanish in terms of tickets sold so far and the strong attendance for Murray&#8217;s opener inside the tournament&#8217;s smallest court, with a capacity of 2,500, has not been consistent across other morning matches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Murray, along with Nadal and Djokovic, is one of the competition&#8217;s biggest attractions this week and Britain&#8217;s prospects of progressing to the quaterfinals look good ahead of Thursday&#8217;s tie against Kazakhstan. It remains to be seen whether Murray plays or is rested against the Kazakhs but he was given a stiff workout by the 23-year-old Griekspoor, who was a surprise pick in the Dutch team ahead of Botic Van de Zandschlup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;About an hour before the match it changed,&#8221; said Murray. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know much about his game.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Murray again dug deep, his experience and resilience proving the difference as Griekspoor lost his nerve and then the match.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Haase outlasted Evans 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 6-4 while Jamie Murray and Skupski held on for a 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) win over Wesley Koolhof and Jean-Julien Rojer.</p>
<p>Djokovic enjoyed a more comfortable start as he cruised to a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Nishioka in a straightforward win for Serbia against Japan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably one of the biggest challenges we can have in this competition, playing against France, one of the most successful nations in Davis Cup, and definitely one of the strongest teams,&#8221; Djokovic said.</p>
<p>Nadal saw off Croatia&#8217;s Borna Gojo 6-4, 6-3 and then helped Spain win the doubles rubber alongside Marcel Granollers.</p>

<p>Rafael Nadal instigated a Spanish comeback against Russia in the Davis Cup on Tuesday by capitalizing on a raucous home crowd to beat Karen Khachanov in straight sets.</p>
<p>Nadal, who will finish the year as world No.1, came through a second-set tiebreaker to defeat Khachanov 6-3, 7-6 (9/7) and level the Group B match in Madrid.</p>
<p>Marcel Granollers and Feliciano Lopez then won the deciding doubles rubber 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) against Khachanov and Andrey Rublev, who had earlier given Russia the lead with a 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0) win over Roberto Bautista Agut.</p>
<p>A new format this year means the Davis Cup takes place in one venue, across a single week, with organizers &#8211; among them Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique &#8211; hoping a tighter schedule will revitalise the prestigious trophy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three stadiums at the Caja Magica were all far from full for Tuesday&#8217;s early matches but Nadal enjoyed a bumper crowd of local fans for his hard-fought contest in the evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;The atmosphere was amazing,&#8221; said Nadal. Asked about the success of the competition so far, he added, &#8220;It is difficult to answer today. Let me wait until the tournament is over to have a clear and better opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last doubles match finished at just before 2:00 am, with Spain due to be back in action against Croatia on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only negative in my opinion is we are just starting the last match and it&#8217;s 12:45 am,&#8221; Nadal said ahead of the doubles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;That means big trouble for us the players and also for the people who have come to the stadium too, because tomorrow is a workday. It makes everything difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s Nick Kyrgios said he was ready to lead Australia to glory in the tournament after they overcame Colombia.</p>
<p>Kyrgios battled past Alejandro Gonzalez 6-4, 6-4 and Alex de Minaur defeated Daniel Galan 6-4, 6-3 before John Peers and Jordan Thompson also won the doubles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t played that much in the past couple of months but I took time off to get ready for this event,&#8221; Kyrgios said afterwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can win it for sure. The way that Alex is playing and I know I can beat every single person in this competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canada are through after Vasek Pospisil and Denis Shapovalov won singles ties against Reilly Opelka and Taylor Fritz respectively to secure victory over the US while France had earlier survived a scare, the tournament&#8217;s top seeds needing to win a decisive doubles rubber to beat Japan.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Argentina beat Chile 3-0 and Kazakhstan prevailed 2-1 against the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kazakhstan needed Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik to win the doubles rubber 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) against Dutch pair Robin Haase and Jean-­Julien Rojer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stefanos Tsitsipas said he was ready for a breakthrough Grand Slam victory after winning the ATP Finals in London &#8211; but a glance at recent history invites caution.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Greek was in bullish mood after he beat Dominic Thiem, having ousted Roger Federer in the semifinals, to become the season-ending event&#8217;s youngest winner since 2001.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;m really close to being crowned a Grand Slam champion,&#8221; he said, after his 6-7 (6/8), 6-2, 7-6 (7/4) triumph in London on Sunday. &#8220;I know these are strong words that I say but I do feel I belong there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But although Tsitsipas&#8217; victory feels significant, he is the fourth first-time champion in as many years at the season finale, which has proved a poor predictor of future success.</p>
<p>Last year, young German Alexander Zverev pummelled Novak Djokovic in the final but he had a miserable time at this season&#8217;s Slams &#8211; while the Serb, 32, picked up the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles to take his overall tally to 16. Rafael Nadal, 33, won a barely credible 12th French Open title and added the US Open, underlining the fact that the old guard were still very much in charge.</p>
<p>No member of the &#8220;Big Three&#8221; &#8211; also featuring Federer &#8211; has won the season-ending ATP Finals since 2015, when Djokovic picked up his fifth title.</p>
<p>Djokovic was also the last ATP Finals champion to go on to win a major title.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Injury-plagued Andy Murray has won only two trophies since he secured his sole ATP Finals title in 2016, crowning his strongest season.</p>
<p>And the lavishly ­gifted but inconsistent Grigor Dimitrov has not won a tournament since his 2017 success at the season finale.</p>
<p>The fact remains that despite all the razzmatazz surrounding the ATP Finals, it is the Grand Slams that are the true yardstick in tennis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 38-year-old Federer won his first Grand Slam title in 2003, the Big Three have collected an astonishing 55 out of the 66 majors on offer, with Murray and Stan Wawrinka also winning three apiece.</p>
<p>There has long been speculation over who would have the guts and talent to overthrow the established order.</p>
<p>Players such as Milos Raonic, Dimitrov and Kei Nishikori &#8211; members of a previous supposed &#8220;next generation,&#8221; consistently failed to challenge the dominant trio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, that is not to say that there&#8217;s no hope for the younger players, who now appear to be getting closer.</p>
