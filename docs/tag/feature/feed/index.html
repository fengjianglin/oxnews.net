<p>The Belgium football authority is eyeing to win the European Championship next year, as the team maintained their strong position as the world No.1 since October 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;Winning it [the European ­Championship] is not going to be an easy task, but with the players that we have right now, it&#8217;s our ambition to go as far as possible,&#8221; Manu Leroy, ­Director of Marketing of Royal Belgian Football Association (RBFA), told the Global Times in a recent interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is probably more difficult than to win a World Cup, it&#8217;s the tournament that is with all the best teams in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Belgium national football team has qualified for the 2020 UEFA European Championship with the maximum ranking points, by winning all games in the qualifying stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boasting several international stars including Eden Hazard, Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, Belgium is considered one of the most daunting sides in football. But they haven&#8217;t won any titles since 1920, when Belgians won the football title at the 1920 Antwerp Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe winning a gold medal [at the European Championship] would be fantastic … The generation has been quite successful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would be really great in 2020 like 100 years later to win again, the silverware will be fantastic.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent success of Belgium football was in 2018, when they reached the semifinals of the FIFA World Cup in Russia, losing to the ultimate winners France.</p>
<p>Instead of traditionally hosting the European Championship in a single country, the 2020 edition will be held across 12 cities of 11 countries in ­Europe, as the event marks the 60th anniversary of the championship. That allows every team to travel to more places and influence more people to enjoy football.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Deeper engagement with China</span></strong></p>
<p>Belgium is also looking for a better engagement with the development of Chinese football.</p>
<p>&#8220;As China needs to develop players and coaches, Belgium can bring a lot of knowledge to China,&#8221; Leroy told the Global Times. &#8220;We are very open to discussions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a direct link in terms of youth development [between China and Belgium] and we have some specialists in Belgium. We have a couple of good academies at the club level, but we also have people who have worked a lot training coaches.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RBFA has also penned a deal with Lagardere Sports to promote its presence in China this year, both online and offline.</p>
<p>Li Ying, Managing Director of the Greater China region for Lagardere Sports, said Belgium football has the potential to be more influential thanks to its stars&#8217; popularity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike the European giants France, Germany, Italy and England whose reputations are already well ­established as a team in China, ­Belgium players&#8217; individual reputations among the young Chinese fans are very strong,&#8221; Li told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a bright future in this and Belgian football will increase its influence in China.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three Belgian stars are playing in the Chinese Super League, with Yannick Carrasco at Dalian Yifang, Mousa Dembélé at Guangzhou R&amp;F and Marouane Fellaini of Shandong Luneng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belgium internationals Hazard of Real Madrid and De Bruyne of Manchester City have social media accounts on China&#8217;s Twitter-like ­platform Weibo, with their fans numbering in the millions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Embedded in culture</strong></span></p>
<p>For a long time, some Chinese parents considered football, or sports in general, as dangerous to their kids, as they may pose a &#8220;threat&#8221; to the children&#8217;s safety. Leroy warned that Chinese parents should change their mind-set, as it is not only beneficial to the children&#8217;s physique but also their mentality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;You have to work with your body, but you also need to work with your head,&#8221; Leroy told the Global Times. &#8220;Injuries are not inevitable. Children are able to play smartly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In every school that you go through in Belgium, children are playing football, though not necessarily on grass or a big pitch,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;Sports is also embedded in the curriculum at school.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belgium has between 500,000 to 600,000 registered players, which means every local village is likely to have a football club, as the club number has reached 6,000, Leroy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of incentives to do sports and football. Belgium has the mentality to do a lot of sports.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Bayern Munich&#8217;s Robert Lewandowski celebrates after scoring his fourth goal during the Champions League match against Red Star Belgrade in Belgrade, Serbia, on Tuesday. Photo: IC</p>
<p>Robert Lewandowski underlined his status as a world-class striker with a Champions League record four goals in 15 minutes, leaving even his rivals comparing him to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.</p>
<p>The Bayern Munich star needed 14 minutes and 31 seconds to score his quartet in Tuesday&#8217;s 6-0 rout of Red Star Belgrade, making him the Champions League&#8217;s top scorer with 10 goals in five games.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must admit, I&#8217;m addicted to goals,&#8221; Lewandowski, 31, wrote on Twitter, having now netted 27 goals in 20 games for Bayern this season.</p>
<p>Bayern have won all four games under interim coach Hansi Flick, ­conceding zero goals in the process and scoring 16 &#8211; seven of which were by Lewandowski.</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert is currently in top form,&#8221; said Flick. &#8220;He works incredibly professionally, always puts in extra work and has been rewarded for it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>His wife Anna, a former karate champion and fitness blogger, describes Lewandowski as a &#8220;machine&#8221; who puts in the hours at the gym to stay in top shape.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">&#8216;Machine&#8217;</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;He really is a machine. His body is impressive. He is an absolute professional and sticks strictly to his diet plan,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>His goal-scoring exploits are all the more remarkable given that Lewandowski needs a minor groin operation, most likely during January&#8217;s winter break.</p>
<p>Lewandowski, who was applauded off even by some Red Star fans, could have finished with five goals in Belgrade after a first-half effort was ruled out because of an offside from teammate Tolisso Corentin in the buildup.</p>
<p>However, the Frenchman made up for it by creating two of the four goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;He [Lewandowski] gets a lot of chances if we play like this,&#8221; said Thomas Mueller as Bayern enjoyed 71 percent possession and peppered the Belgrade goal with 29 shots.</p>
<p>Lewandowski has 63 goals in 85 Champions League games, ­making him fifth in the list of all-time ­scorers behind Ronaldo (127), Messi (113), Spain&#8217;s Raul Gonzalez (71) and France&#8217;s Karim Benzema (64).</p>
<p>The Poland striker is the top-­scoring foreigner in ­Bundesliga ­history with 281 goals in 302 games for Bayern and former club ­Dortmund.</p>
<p>His Belgrade haul was reminiscent of the five he scored in nine minutes in a 5-1 rout of Wolfsburg at the Allianz Arena in September 2015.</p>
<p>He is no stranger to scoring four goals in the Champions League, having achieved the same stunning feat in Dortmund&#8217;s 4-1 hammering of Real Madrid in the 2013 semifinals.</p>
<p>Lewandowski is deadly in the area for club and country.</p>
<p>The Poland captain has 61 goals in 108 internationals, sailing past the all-time record of 48 scored by Wlodzimierz Lubanski in the 1960s and 70s.</p>
<p>Adam Nawalka, Poland coach from 2013 until 2018, said he would not swap Lewandowski for either Ronaldo or Messi.</p>
<p>Bayern&#8217;s 4-0 trashing of Fortuna Duesseldorf away last Saturday was remarkable only because it was ­Munich&#8217;s first league game this season in which Lewandowski failed to score.</p>
<p>By netting in the first 11 league games, he smashed the record of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored for Dortmund in the first eight games of 2015-16.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Free transfer</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t score every game unless your name is Robert Lewandowski,&#8221; joked RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner in early November.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s currently in the same category as Ronaldo and Messi.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former Lech Poznan striker has not stopped scoring since breaking into the Dortmund team with eight goals in the 2010-11 season to help win the first of back-to-back league titles.</p>
<p>He forged an international reputation in four seasons at Dortmund, netting a hat trick against future employers Bayern in the 2012 German Cup final before his four against Real in 2013.</p>
<p>Despite Dortmund&#8217;s best efforts to keep him, he walked away to join ­rivals Bayern on a free transfer in 2014, helping them win the Bundesliga five times and the German Cup twice.</p>
<p>However, he is running out of time to win the only title yet to elude him &#8211; the Champions League.</p>
<p>Bayern are doing everything ­possible to keep their star happy.</p>
<p>After he demanded new big-name players were recruited last summer, Philippe Coutinho and Ivan Perisic arrived on loan.</p>
<p>In August, Lewandowski signed a new contract &#8211; reportedly worth 15 million euros ($16.5 million) &#8211; until June 2023, just shy of his 35th birthday.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Mauricio Pochettino Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 was the first time on English soil a battle saw English archers meet each other.</p>
<p>The King&#8217;s army met the rebel army led by Henry &#8220;Harry&#8221; Hotspur&#8217;s in a field and during the battle, Hotspur, for whom Tottenham Hotspurs are so named died.</p>
<p>His descendants owned land in the neighborhood of what would become Tottenham but given the recent events at the club, it seems his legacy is closer to the events of the battle than anything before.</p>
<p>Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino was ousted on Tuesday and swiftly replaced by Jose Mourinho on Wednesday. It was a move as swift as the archers who felled many of the club&#8217;s eponymous hero and his men all those centuries ago, and one that might have left the victim caught unawares.</p>
<p>Such cruelty is nothing new. Pochettino had taken the Hotspurs to within one game of being Champions of Europe. Instead, they lost to Liverpool and, to use another term from the 15th century, Pochettimo&#8217;s goose was cooked.</p>
<p>Yes, the Argentine had overseen a run of games that had seen Spurs not win an away game since January 20 of this year which was a 2-1 win over Fulham, who would go on to be relegated, at Craven Cottage. That winless run extended over two seasons and was at odds with the form that Pochettino&#8217;s side found in the UEFA Champions League as they went to the final in Madrid.</p>
<p>Arguably the away form only told half the story. Pochettino&#8217;s Spurs had only picked up 40 points in the 2019 calendar year prior to him being relieved of his duties. That&#8217;s relegation form and worrying for the board who have just shelled out on the expanded stadium.</p>
<p>However, he could have turned it around it given the chance. The other argument is that the former Espanyol and Southampton manager &#8220;lost the dressing room&#8221; but the messages of support from his former charges in interviews and social media counters that.</p>
<p>Regardless, Mourinho is the new Spurs manager, returning to the Premier League 11 months after being sacked by Manchester United. How long the Portuguese serial champion will last at the new White Hart Lane is anyone&#8217;s guess, but as Pochettino looks for a new job he can feel hard done by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not the only one. There are plenty of other managers who have been relieved of their duties despite taking the club to touching distance of trophies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Louis van Gaal &#8211; Manchester United</span></strong></p>
<p>The Dutchman had guided the Red Devils to the 2016 FA Cup, a first trophy since Alex Ferguson left the club in the hands of David Moyes. However, rumors that the former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager would be replaced started doing the rounds inside Wembley as the side lifted the cup and he was sacked two days later to be replaced by Mourinho.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Claudio Ranieri &#8211; Leicester City</span></strong></p>
<p>Dilly, ding. Dilly, dong. That was the bell sound that the Italian made famous in the season that his Leicester City side became the most unlikely champions of the Premier League era. However, Ranieri found that the bell tolled for him the very next season when he was sacked with the club in 17th place in the league and on their first-ever Champions League adventure. Ranieri was also sacked despite his relative success at Chelsea, where he had guided the club to second behind Arsenal&#8217;s &#8220;Invincibles&#8221; which at the time was their highest-ever Premier League finish. The Tinkerman, as Ranieri was unfairly known, was replaced by Mourinho.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Roberto Mancini &#8211; Inter Milan</span></strong></p>
<p>The former Sampdoria player was an undoubted success with the Nerazzurri, where he won three consecutive Serie A titles and became the club&#8217;s most successful manager in three decades. But with none of that coming in Europe, he was sacked in 2009 and replaced by Mourinho. The new man guided Inter to the Champions League the following season.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br /><strong>Carlo Ancelotti &#8211; Real Madrid</strong></span></p>
<p>The Italian is no stranger to an unjust sacking. He found himself out of the Chelsea job after taking the Stamford Bridge side to the quarterfinals of&nbsp; the Champions League and runners-up in the Premier League. That was nothing compared to Real Madrid where he had replaced Mourinho and made them Champions of Europe, beating city rivals Atletico in the final. The next season he challenged Barcelona for the La Liga title, finishing two points behind them, won both the FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup, and reached the semifinals of the Champions League. He was sacked and replaced by Rafa Benitez.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Roberto di Matteo &#8211; Chelsea</strong></span></p>
<p></strong>Chelsea is a dangerous place for managers and the Italian found that. Having won the Champions League as caretaker boss, Di Matteo was given the role full time but was sacked the following November after being knocked out of the group stage by Juventus. His team were just four points off the top of the table.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Nigel Adkins &#8211; Southampton</span></strong></p>
<p>The Englishman had taken the South Coast side from League One to the Premier League and they were three points outside of the relegation zone when he was sacked and replaced by Pochettino. Adkins&#8217; departure was put down to the &#8220;long-term ambitions&#8221; of the club but he sued them for wrongful dismissal. They settled on 500,000 pounds ($647,250) compensation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Avram Grant &#8211; Chelsea</strong></span></p>
<p></strong>The Israeli&#8217;s Stamford Bridge demise was similar to Pochettino&#8217;s in that he had taken the club to the Champions League final and lost to another Premier League side. Grant&#8217;s Chelsea were beaten by Manchester United in Moscow in the 2008 final, whom they finished two points behind at the top of the league table, and had also lost to Spurs in the League Cup final. He was sacked at the end of the season.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Tesla vehicles sit parked outside of a showroom in Brooklyn in New York. File photo: VCG</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Wednesday cited driver errors and Tesla Inc&#8217;s Autopilot design as the probable causes of a Model S crash in January 2018. The car, which was operating in Autopilot mode, crashed into a parked fire truck on a highway in California early last year.</p>
<p>The safety board, which previously criticized Tesla&#8217;s driver-assistance system Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, said that the system&#8217;s design &#8220;permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task&#8221; in the Culver City, California, crash. The NTSB said on Tuesday that Autopilot allowed the driver to keep his hands off the wheel for the vast majority of the nearly 14 minutes of the trip.</p>
<p>The fire truck was unoccupied and the driver was not injured in the incident. The NTSB cited the driver&#8217;s &#8220;inattention and overreliance&#8221; on the advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal US crashes, including one involving a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida, and a crash in Mountain View, California, of a Model X. Both incidents, which occurred in March 2018, remain under investigation by the NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The NTSB is responsible for making safety recommendations, while the NHTSA can order a recall if it deems a defect poses an unreasonable risk to safety.</p>
<p>The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer-watchdog group, said on Wednesday that the NTSB report should prompt NHTSA to &#8220;do its job and recall these vehicles &#8230; A vehicle that enables a driver to not pay attention, or fall asleep, while accelerating into a parked fire truck is defective and dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla said in an emailed statement that since the 2018 crash, &#8220;We have made updates to our system including adjusting the time intervals between hands-on warnings and the conditions under which they&#8217;re activated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company added that Tesla owners have driven billions of miles with Autopilot engaged, and that its data &#8220;indicates that drivers using Autopilot remain safer than those operating without assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system&#8217;s ability to detect hazards, and sparked safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.</p>
<p>After the fatal 2016 Florida crash, NTSB asked six automakers with advanced driver assistance systems &#8211; Tesla, Volkswagen AG, BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co, Daimler AG and Volvo Car &#8211; to &#8220;develop applications to more effectively sense the driver&#8217;s level of engagement and alert the driver when engagement is lacking while automated vehicle control systems are in use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All manufacturers except Tesla have responded to the NTSB, explaining their current systems and their efforts to reduce misuse and keep drivers engaged,&#8221; the NTSB said.</p>
<p>While Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.</p>
<p>The NTSB said that had the driver in the case been paying close attention, &#8220;he could have taken evasive action to avoid or mitigate the collision.&#8221;</p>
