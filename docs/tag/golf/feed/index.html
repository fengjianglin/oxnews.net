<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many golfers opted to play in trousers on Thursday despite being allowed to wear shorts because of intense heat when the 2020 European Tour season teed off in South Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With temperatures set to reach 40 C during the Alfred Dunhill Championship, the organizers said shorts could be worn for the first time at an EPGA event.</p>
<p>While golfers wear shorts during practice rounds and at pre-tournament pro-ams, they were not permitted during competitions until the searing heat brought a change of heart this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Females can wear shorts on the various professional circuits, including ­Europe, Asia and the US.</p>
<p>Among those who donned shorts for the first round of the Dunhill at Leopard Creek Country Club beside the Kruger National Park wildlife reserve was four-time major winner Ernie Els.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the right thing to do and a victory for common sense,&#8221; said the 50-year-old South African, ranked No.424 in the world and in the twilight of his illustrious career.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wearing shorts in extreme heat has been talked about for so long on all of the tours around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this could be a game-changer for golf that will end up enhancing the product,&#8221; added the two-time winner of both the British and US Open championships.</p>
<p>Dane Thomas Bjorn, captain of the 2018 Europe and Ireland Ryder Cup team, was another competitor to wear shorts at the stunningly picturesque course in northeastern South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Golf has been moving in this direction and because of the extreme heat we need to make it as comfortable for the players as we can.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are traditions in golf that will always be upheld, but we also need to try and make it easier for kids to get involved in the game and move with the times.&#8221;</p>
<p>European Tour tournament director David Williams said the decision was made to protect player health.</p>
<p>&#8220;The temperatures will increase as the week goes on and a lot of players were concerned about it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The relaxed rules on shorts will apply only to the Alfred Dunhill Championship tournament for now, a European Tour statement said.</p>
<p>Daniel Greene was first to tee off Thursday, at 06:20 local time (04:20 GMT), and opted for trousers, unlike most of his South African compatriots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golf is a sport steeped in tradition with European Tour competitors wearing shoes, trousers, a golf shirt and, usually, a cap for decades.</p>
<p>Additional clothing, like a jacket, is added when the weather turns cold or wet.</p>

<p>Golfer Tony Finau was the victim of a prank when Tiger Woods called to reveal his captain&#8217;s picks for next month&#8217;s Presidents Cup in Australia, but he has adopted a forgive if not forget attitude about the conversation.</p>
<p>Finau said he &#8220;never&#8221; suspected that captain Woods was joking when he said he had some &#8220;sad news,&#8221; which Finau presumed meant he had not received one of the four wild card selections. Woods, it turns out, is quite the jokester.</p>
<p>Finau told the Reuters that he was kind of saddened at that time, adding that Woods had left him hanging for about 15 seconds, a long 15 seconds at that, before finally telling him that he was on the team.</p>
<p>Woods could sense Finau&#8217;s disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could feel his heart sink when I said I had some tough news. So I let him sweat it out before welcoming him to the Presidents Cup,&#8221; Woods wrote on the match&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>Finau said he will not hold any hard feelings against Woods for his prank.</p>

<p>Every member of the Internationals team wants to take on Tiger Woods at the Presidents Cup, with assistant captain Geoff Ogilvy suggesting Australians Marc Leishman, Cameron Smith and former No.1 Jason Day are front runners.</p>
<p>Woods will be playing captain when he leads a star-­studded United States against the Internationals skippered by Ernie Els in the biennial team match-play showdown at Royal Melbourne from December 12 to 15.</p>
<p>Australian Ogilvy, who played in three Presidents Cups, said all of the 12-man team had put their hand up to face the 15-time major winner, but favored one of his fellow Australians to take on Woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jason [Day] can clearly hang with Tiger and go down the stretch with him,&#8221; Ogilvy, who with Els was a member of the losing International team at Royal Melbourne in 2011, told the Melbourne Herald Sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Cam and Leish, they have really stood up the last couple of years and they are so bought into this. Cam is bouncing out of his skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on the situation of the match. It depends how the picks go too, we alternate, so Tiger could choose who he wants to play against. There&#8217;s no real control there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woods will be the first playing captain since American Hale Irwin in the inaugural 1994 Presidents Cup after giving himself a wild card following his record-equaling 82nd US PGA Tour title in Japan last month.</p>
<p>He spearheads a formidable team that features the three of the world&#8217;s top four golfers in No.1 Brooks Koepka, third-ranked Dustin Johnson and No.4 Justin Thomas.</p>
<p>Els has a relatively inexperienced team looking to win the event for only the second time in its 25-year history. Their sole win came at the same Royal Melbourne venue in 1998.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The American team look like a bit of a juggernaut but we&#8217;ve got a good young team,&#8221; Ogilvy told reporters at the course on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a tough place for them to play and Ernie is historically great around Royal Melbourne so he&#8217;s got a lot of wisdom and the players want to win for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Americans are in a sweet spot of form but if you watch the Ryder Cup, they are very beatable if you play well. I see no reason why we can&#8217;t pump them,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The Presidents Cup will open with five four-ball matches on the Thursday, followed by five foursomes on Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be four foursomes and four four-balls on Saturday with 12 singles to round out the competition on Sunday.&nbsp;<br />
