<p>Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center (SDAC) released eight of its plays for 2020 on Tuesday. This year, the release was done in a &#8220;dramatic&#8221; way by turning the whole of the center into an interactive wonderland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guided by the voice of artists in the headphones, the audience walked through different spaces of the building like the dressing room, the rehearsal room and corridors where excerpts of plays were being put on, one after another. The sounds, lights, shows and actors created a world of immersive and interactive experiences for the audience.</p>
<p>Zhang Huiqing, general manager of the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center, told the Global Times that this tour gives the audience an opportunity to feel the essence of drama in a relaxed and immersive way.</p>
<p>The excerpts of the plays in the immersive tour are from the eight works that the center will put on in 2020, which cover both classic and modern works, such as Beneath the Red Banner by renowned Chinese novelist and playwright Lao She (1899-1966), The Dream of The Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin (1715-63), comedy I Love Peach Blossom, and music drama Letter Home from the War, as well as Under the Roofs of Shanghai, which portrays the lives of Shanghai residents in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Adaptations of foreign works like The Three Musketeers by French writer Alexandre Dumas (1802-70), Death of A Salesman by US playwright Arthur Miller (1915-2005), and Miss Julie by Swedish writer August Strindberg (1849-1912), are also included.</p>

<p>According to Zhang, the center will release 52 plays on diverse subjects in 2020, including both Eastern and Western literature, with classics and original works.</p>
<p>The drama tour, as Zhang said, will also be a new program open to the public for 2020. It encourages the audience to leave their seats in the theater to see the other parts of a play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, what the audience can see is only the last 10 percent of a stage play. We want the audience to know more about people working on stage plays, the history of our center and the history of drama in an interesting way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The center also hosts the Shanghai International Theatre Festival every September, inviting foreign drama groups to perform plays for local audiences.</p>
<p>2020 marks the 25th anniversary of the center. In November 2017, the center started renovating its building on Anfu Road. It reopened to the public in May this year. Compared with the previous version, the public area of the building was enlarged by 40 percent. In addition to plays, the center will also host exhibitions, lectures, art salons and workshops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China National Peking Opera Company (CNPOC) returns to London&#8217;s Sadler&#8217;s Wells Theatre from Wednesday to Thursday this year.</p>
<p>It will be the fifth consecutive year that the CNPOC has come to London, and the company will perform two exceptional shows for UK audiences: a Peking Opera Gala night and the masterpiece<br />
<em>Warrior Women of Yang</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Peking Opera Gala evening is an exceptional opportunity to experience an array of famous Peking Opera scenes, highlighting the various performance aspects of Peking Opera: music, song, mime, acrobatics, stage combat, exquisite costumes and painted faces. The evening will feature performances by the celebrated Peking Opera artists Yu Kuizhi and Li Shengsu, with famous scenes including &#8220;Drunken Imperial Concubine.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursday, the rarely seen spectacular<br />
<em>Warrior Women of Yang</em> will tell a story of grief, courage, patriotism and family loyalty. A cast of over 50 will mesmerize the audience with amazing stage combat and acrobatics. This show was last performed in London in 2015, gaining rave reviews and an invitation to appear on The One Show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liu Xiaoming, Chinese Ambassador to the UK, said that in telling China&#8217;s classical stories through song and dance, Peking Opera is the finest example of traditional Chinese culture and carries the rich cultural heritage of the Chinese nation. &#8220;This jewel of Chinese culture has won the hearts of more and more British people,&#8221; Liu said.</p>
<p>Kevin Zhang, director of Sinolink Productions, the company that helped bring the troupe to the UK, told the Global Times that it&#8217;s a very exciting time for Chinese arts and culture in the UK, as interest among British audiences continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, the stage will be filled with an array of exciting acrobatics, superlative vocals and music amidst the drama of love versus patriotism, a fight against oppressors and the comedy of mistaken identity,&#8221; Zhang noted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bev Lilywhite, production manager with Sinolink, told the Global Times that Peking Opera is a very different art form for Westerners. In order to help the audience better understand the Chinese performances, Sinolink Production brought them backstage by hosting a series of workshops to reveal the finer details of this intriguing art form at Oxford University this year and at the British Library last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peking Opera not only presents the spectacular costumes, face painting make-up and stunning stage crafts to the audience, but also explains the essence of traditional Chinese values. Keeping this ancient Chinese art form alive and sharing its beauty and stagecraft with the world is what we have been working on,&#8221; said Peking Opera artist Yu Kuizhi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peking Opera is a unique art form. To achieve the highest level of performing skill requires lifelong dedication to practicing the art. Most of the artists begin their training at a very young age at opera school before becoming an apprentice and learning from the masters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cultural adventure,&#8221; Lilywhite said, adding that instead of traveling all the way to Beijing, people can enjoy the best Peking Opera performance in London.</p>

<p>When the lights in the theater go dark, the audience falls completely silent in anticipation. For many, this will be the first time they have had the opportunity to appreciate a Western theater work, as such shows are not commonplace in this third-tier city in Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is<br />
<em>Anywhere</em>, a French avant-garde puppet show that debuted at the ongoing international theater festival in Xichang, Sichuan Province, on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Theater fest&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The award-winning<br />
<em>Anywhere </em>chronicles the trials of life through the lens of<br />
<em>Oedipus on the Road</em>, a novel authored by Henry Bauchau. This unique&#8221;visual poem&#8221; invites the audience to experience the different states of the element of water through a puppet made of ice as it slowly transforms into water and finally evaporates into vapor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the first drama where we attempted to use a puppet made of ice,&#8221; director Elise Vigneron told the Global Times on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I read the novel, I hoped to express the process of life from birth to death, every moment of it. Then, I thought about &#8216;what kind of material can I use?'&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, Vigneron turned to ice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can transform from solid to liquid and then to steam. Additionally, it perfectly matches the life and destiny of Oedipus,&#8221; Vigneron explained.</p>
<p>For puppet maker Helene Barr, this would be no easy task as it meant she would witness the puppet&#8217;s inception, and then its gradual melting, in a single day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the initial performances, I felt sorry for it just as many in the audience did. But gradually I noticed that it is the melting down and then disappearing that makes it meaningful for each audience member to remember the Oedipus story and his destiny.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides shows like the Romanian drama<br />
<em>Dream Before Breakfast</em> and French circus<br />
<em> Haute Heure</em>, the festival also has a number of street tours and interactive events featuring China&#8217;s rich cultural legacies such as Peking, Sichuan and Tibetan Opera.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Young hope</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A city known to the world as one of China&#8217;s important satellite bases, Xichang is also home to a number of ethnic minority groups, including the Yi and Tibetan people, whose cultures&nbsp; prominently feature singing and dancing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tobias Biancone, director general of the International Theatre Institute (ITI), told the Global Times on Sunday that he was touched by local performers, especially young kids who had a grand time singing and dancing on Saturday at a gala celebrating the festival.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are so dedicated and so happy to be able to show off their talents,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is exactly what festivals like the Xichang International Theater Festival need to do and to be, a spark. Light up their desire to be entertained and fall in love with theater. Their spiritual fire needs to be ignited,&#8221; Biancone added.</p>
<p>For the festival&#8217;s initiators, such as Chinese actor Pu Cunxin, attracting audiences, especially young people, has always been the theater festival&#8217;s first priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first step that we did is to inform them that we have such a festival with so many richly diverse dramas here in Xichang. After they discover this, they will choose what they like the most,&#8221; Pu said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was also happy to see more young faces at the festival than at Western festivals, which tend to be attended by older audiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Telling Chinese stories</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Localization has always been an important mission for international festivals like the Edinburgh Fringe and Avignon in France. In China, this is even more important as creatives are urgently trying to find ways to tell Chinese stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biancone recalled his past dialogues with Western audiences about what is Chinese theater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of them may answer Peking Opera,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The international public has no idea what is going on here in China. Peking Opera is just a small part of China&#8217;s rich culture, and Chinese Opera as well. China should create theater works based on their roots, in Chinese ways, not Western ones. Yesterday, I saw a dance that I&#8217;ve never seen before. That is something that China can present to the world. The richness of your nation, it can be drama, can be poetry, can be Chinese Opera performances.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a forum during the festival, Japanese theater scholar Taeko Nagai echoed Biancone&#8217;s thoughts that China is a storehouse of stories and that many Japanese theater works have even been inspired by these stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key is to communicate and work together to make things happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Japanese director Makoto Nakashima told the Global Times that international festivals such as the one in Xichang can allow people from different backgrounds and cultures to communicate with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such example is<br />
<em>Hero</em>. Set to debut on Thursday, the play is the result of such international communication.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible to put people from different backgrounds, cultures and who speak different languages in a room together. That is exactly what we are doing now,&#8221; Michael Leibenluft, the New York-based theater director behind the show, told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to come in one color, instead, many different colors together, that is great too. The possibility of combination is endless.&#8221;&nbsp;<br />

<p>A state theater in the capital Ashgabat was packed for the staging of 19th century Italian composer Ruggero Leoncavallo&#8217;s opera<br />
<em>Pagliacci</em> (<br />
<em>Clowns</em>) as part of an international drama festival.</p>
<p>Older spectators leaving the theater late on a cool Tuesday night voiced nostalgia for the long-taboo art form while younger spectators enthused over the performance.</p>
<p>Mekan Byashimov, a 54-year-old schoolteacher, said he hoped that operas would be staged regularly and that ballet would also make a reappearance on the national stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We used to have good premieres. I went regularly. If we want to call ourselves a cultured nation, we need to restore opera and ballet,&#8221; Byashimov told AFP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aina Shiryayeva, a 20-year-old student watching opera for the first time, said she had enjoyed the performance despite not understanding any of the words.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The music and the artists! Everything was so wonderful. I am delighted. I have seen the opera!&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gas-rich Turkmenistan&#8217;s eccentric first leader Sapurmurat Niyazov banned opera as well as foreign ballet in 2001 in what he posited was a move to protect Turkmen culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ban on art forms continued under second president Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who came to power after Niyazov&#8217;s death in 2006.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The director of Tuesday&#8217;s joint Turkmen-Italian performance Daniele de Plano told AFP in an interview that<br />
<em>Pagliacci</em> was staged as part of a &#8220;cultural exchange program&#8221; between Italy and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>He said he felt &#8220;honored to be the first director to bring back opera&#8221; to Muslim-majority Turkmenistan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really hope this is the beginning of a new path of ties becoming closer between Turkmenistan and opera, particularly Italian opera,&#8221; said de Plano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the main roles in the performance only one was played by an Italian, with the others filled by Turkmen singers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Baritone Amangeldi Amanov was singing for the second time the part of Silvio &#8211; a lover who gets murdered by a jealous husband, the opera&#8217;s lead character, Canio.</p>
<p>The first time he played the role in March 2001 was his debut and also the last time that opera was performed in Ashgabat, a city of 1 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is historic for us. Our younger generation is coming into contact with European culture. This performance is a first step in the comeback of the Turkmen operatic tradition,&#8221; Amanov enthused in an interview with AFP before the performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The musical<br />
<em>Titanic</em> kicked off the first show of its tour of China at the Beijing Tianqiao Performing Arts Center on Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to the musical&#8217;s producer Danielle Tarento, the cast and crew were very excited to come to China for a tour. She noted that she is confident that the Chinese audience will be able to fully enjoy the English-language production without having to worry about any cultural misunderstandings.</p>
<p>&#8220;The show is very different from other musicals because it is about humanity, and we all understand that. The subject is universal and in that sense, it will touch everyone. This show will attack you, and move you even if you do not understand the language, so we are not worried that the Chinese audience will have a problem when enjoying the show,&#8221; Tarento told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>James Cameron&#8217;s film<br />
<em>Titanic</em> was hugely successful at the box office in China in 1997. The film ensured that Chinese audiences were very familiar with the story of the doomed luxury liner, but director Thom Southerland said he believes that the musical and movie are very different from each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The story background of the two is the same, but the musical is more real than the movie. The musical comes from the real history, using realism to portray the true story between the passengers and crew from different social classes. Every character in the play corresponds to a real historical figure. The musical brings you an immersive experience. When you watch the first half, you may forget the result of the ship crashing into the iceberg and completely resonate with the characters in the story,&#8221; said Southerland at a press conference on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He explained that while the musical will not show the giant boat to the audience, their imaginations will allow them to see it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect that the show can really go into the audiences&#8217; hearts. It is all there in your own mind. This show can make you think you are on board, and I want the Chinese audience to feel they are part of the journey with all these characters,&#8221; he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another trait of the musical is that it is an ensemble play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;We do not have the so-called &#8216;protagonist&#8217;s aura&#8217; because we are all the leading characters in the show,&#8221; said Victoria Serra, one of the show&#8217;s actresses.</p>
<p>The musical<br />
<em>Titanic</em> will be performed at the Beijing Tianqiao Performing Arts Center until November 24, after which it will tour to East China&#8217;s Shanghai, Nanjing in East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province and Guangzhou in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>A musical famous world-wide,<br />
<em>Titanic</em> swept all five categories of the Tony Awards in 1997, including Best Musical and Best Orchestrations. On April 23, 1997,<br />
<em>Titanic</em> premiered at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in Broadway and went on a broader tour in 1999. It has been performed in many countries including the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland and Canada, and has been translated into eight languages such as Japanese, French, Dutch and German.</p>
