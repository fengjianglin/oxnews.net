<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">College graduates engage in a professional skill competition on harvesting machines in farms outside Suzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province. China aims to develop 1 billion mu (67 million hectares) of high-standard farmland by 2022 with a reliable grain production capacity of 500 billion kilograms annually. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Some economists forecast China&#8217;s economic growth may fall below 6 percent next year. These forecasts come as the global economy sees stagnation with weak growth in some nations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if China&#8217;s year-on-year growth dips below 6 percent in 2020, the country won&#8217;t be the world&#8217;s worst-performing major economy. GDP growth of less than 6 percent would still be within a reasonable and bearable range for the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s slowdown is a fact, but the economy is running smoothly as a whole. The Chinese government can pull the economy out of its downturn and keep the growth rate at 7 percent, assuming that a strong stimulus program is carried out. However, the Chinese government has not done so. Why? That&#8217;s because the current growth rate can help China meet its goals of improving living standards while also safeguarding economic stability. This situation allows the government to focus more on economic restructuring, which in turn lays a foundation for long-term economic growth.</p>
<p>The outside world has always scrutinized China&#8217;s GDP figures and often read too much into them. It&#8217;s understandable, because many outside observers have little knowledge about the Chinese economy. They have to resort to indicators such as GDP figures to know what&#8217;s happening in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. Some of those people evaluate the performance of China&#8217;s economy based on rises and falls in the GDP figure, but that&#8217;s a simplistic means of analysis.</p>
<p>As for China, GDP is being seen as a less important metric of economic performance. The nation&#8217;s rapid alleviation of poverty in recent decades means there is less pressure on the country to rely on fast GDP growth to raise the incomes of poor people. Currently, China&#8217;s economic concerns involve solving certain problems, such as hedging financial risks and encouraging independent innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The country faces many problems in search of solutions, but it seems the top priority of the Chinese government isn&#8217;t about keeping the economic growth from slipping below 6 percent. China has repeatedly emphasized that the economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development. But unfortunately, many in the outside world don&#8217;t understand the shift very well.</p>
<p>China has been moving in this direction and will continue on this path. However, it is undeniable that the trade war with the US adds uncertainty to the Chinese economy. China&#8217;s GDP figures have been in the media spotlight, and any change in the reading will influence the public opinion war and confidence in the Chinese economy. China&#8217;s GDP figures have drawn more Western attention amid the trade war, so the figures to some extent will bear more significance in 2020.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy has become a complex system. The wisdom of Chinese people will be tested in deciding how to strike a balance among goals such as 6 percent GDP growth and economic restructuring. China is under pressure to safeguard its economic growth, but it&#8217;s unlikely to return to the old path of relying on massive stimulus.</p>

Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Are China and the US on the way to reaching the first stage of a trade agreement? How far away is the realization of this goal? For some time, both sides have been sending out messages. The US actually contributes more information, but these messages often cancel each other out. It is still uncertain when a consensus can be reached for a phase one trade deal.</p>
<p>More importantly, why is it necessary to have such an agreement? Is it worth it for both sides to work toward that goal?&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one thing, achieving a phase one agreement would signal that the China-US trade war has reached a mutually recognizable turning point. According to the core concerns of both Beijing and Washington, China wants tariffs to be rolled back in the phase one trade agreement, which would be the first step to cancel the tariffs that have been imposed by the two sides since last year. For its part, the US wants China to buy a large amount of American agricultural products right now. If a deal is reached, both countries can benefit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, these economic interests alone are not enough to motivate the two sides to reach an significant result. China and the US can both bear the current losses, and potential future economic losses will be far from fatal for either country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US government believes that China&#8217;s economy is being battered, which is totally self-deceiving propaganda. The trade war has caused China some difficulties, but these difficulties will never lead to significant political compromises by Beijing. China&#8217;s economy is basically under smooth operation, and Chinese society has adapted to cope with the trade war.</p>
<p>The significance of a phase one trade deal will be more political than economic. It will be extensively regarded as a political gesture. China and the US are willing and able to control their huge differences through consultation and negotiation, so that a chain reaction won&#8217;t occur and shake the current world order.</p>
<p>The biggest confusion about this issue from the rest of the world lies in the blurry prospect of China-US relations. From US Vice President Mike Pence to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, many American senior officials express obvious hostility against China, while US President Donald Trump sometimes makes some kind statements to please China. Nevertheless, they are obviously just playing &#8220;good cop, bad cop.&#8221; Many think some American political elites want to help bring about a &#8220;Cold War&#8221; with China. But since that is apparently unpopular in the 21st century, do they really have support in the US?</p>
<p>Trump has never abandoned negotiation with China and the US government has made some practical efforts toward reaching an agreement. Based on this, it appears that radical policies don&#8217;t have uniform support in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington has the motivation to meet Beijing halfway as China seeks to expand its opening-up. American views of China will be tested when Trump runs for re-election next year. That&#8217;s when it will be determined what is most popular among Americans &#8211; the motivation to cooperate with China or the impulse to decouple the two countries&#8217; economies.</p>
<p>Hopefully, a phase one trade agreement can be reached. That would be a mutual success and a tribute to both sides&#8217; rationality. On the contrary, if the other way of thinking dominates China-US relations, both countries will waste time on a dead-end road.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>The Modi government deserves some credit for attempting to push ahead with its largest privatization program in more than a decade. The sale of majority stakes in India&#8217;s state companies is said to be part of its reform effort, with the aim of raising funds to reduce the budget deficit, as well as luring foreign investment and boosting its economy.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Modi government has rolled out reforms aimed at privatizing state-owned companies, which will have a positive impact on the Indian economy in the long run despite the current challenges and resistance.</p>
<p>Yet, the path of reform will not be easy for India, which aims to build the country into an attractive manufacturing destination for foreign businesses. Manufacturing competitiveness cannot be simply improved by selling stakes. Market opening-up is also essential but implementation in this regard is far from simple.</p>
<p>While some say that India&#8217;s economy has greater openness than China&#8217;s, there is a huge gap between China and India when it comes to attracting foreign investment. That&#8217;s not determined just by opening-up policies &#8211; it also requires other supporting factors like infrastructure, logistics and the quality of the labor force. In 2018, foreign direct investment (FDI) in India reached $42 billion, while China received FDI worth a record $139 billion, according to a UN report released in June.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s latest privatization efforts just mark an important step toward its opening-up goal. There is still far to go when it comes to improving its industrial manufacturing ability. It&#8217;s no secret that problems with its tax policies, land system and labor issues have always been considered the key factors restraining the country&#8217;s economic reform and development. Implementation of any unified reform is difficult due to the country&#8217;s demographic and political diversity.</p>
<p>What is happening in India also occurred in China decades ago. Take the textile industry as an example. When China took a full-scale opening-up approach to its textile sector, businesses from developed countries and regions began to enter China, bringing capital, advanced technology and management concepts, which greatly promoted the reform of state-owned textile enterprises at that time. By the end of the last century, China&#8217;s textile industry had an obvious comparative advantage in the world market. Just like what happened with China during reform and opening-up, the influx of foreign investment will help address some of India&#8217;s weaknesses and develop its manufacturing sector. But the process will be difficult, and India&#8217;s own efforts in continuous reform and opening-up are also indispensable.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo:Xinhua</p>
<p>Some Philippine senators may appear to be concerned about the security of their national energy grid after an internal report revealed that the Chinese government has the &#8220;full capability to disrupt national power systems.&#8221; In fact, they are only spoiling the atmosphere for developing the Philippines&#8217; much-needed infrastructure project, harming the overall interests of the country and its people as a whole.</p>
<p>The internal report, leaked by an unidentified source to CNN, is actually making much ado about nothing by raising concerns that are only theoretically possible. And then some lawmakers who have long been biased against China are making a fuss about the so-called flick of a switch, disregarding the fact that there is no reason and no need for China to take such a move.</p>
<p>In fact, the remote control system, which allegedly could be used to switch off the power grid, is only designed for remote troubleshooting so as to ensure the normal operation of the power supply. Power grids in Kenya, Indonesia and Thailand also use the same remote control system, according to media reports.</p>
<p>While there is no evidence to suggest or prove concerns over China&#8217;s interference in the Philippine power grid, some people in the Philippines never tire of hyping such worries over Chinese companies taking control of the Philippines&#8217; power system. Currently, State Grid Corp of China (SGCC) owns a 40 percent stake in the National Grid Corp of the Philippines, a private consortium that has run the country&#8217;s power lines since 2009.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on certain infrastructure construction and economic development, some Philippine politicians are creating obstacles for the country&#8217;s power supply development. It is their people who would end up paying the cost if the energy grid cooperation was disrupted by such a dirty political plot.</p>
<p>The investment made by SGCC in the Philippines is a demonstrative project for commercial cooperation between China and the Philippines. Over the years, Chinese companies have brought capital and advanced technology to the Philippines, improving the stability and reliability of the latter&#8217;s power grid operation and thus benefiting its ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>In particular, SGCC also launched the charitable &#8220;Brighten Up&#8221; project to bring electricity to remote villagers in the Southeast Asian country. In June this year, two Chinese-funded solar power stations were officially completed and handed over to Philippine authorities, according to the Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>It is such a pity that some Philippine politicians only care about their own political tricks and fail to see the good that Chinese companies brought to their people&#8217;s lives.</p>

<div align="left"></div>
<p></font>By seeking a legislative ban on investment in China, hardliners in Washington are actually blocking the Federal Thrift Retirement Investment Board (FTRIB) from pursuing investment decisions in its best interests, which will only see a backlash from financial markets.</p>
<p>After the federal pension fund indicated last week that it intends to press on with plans to shift billions of dollars to an index fund that includes some Chinese A shares, a group of politicians in Washington are still pushing a bipartisan bill that would force the federal retirement fund to change its mind.</p>
<p>The move clearly conflicts with the guidelines of the FTRIB, which is designed to offer federal employees a retirement plan similar to private employers&#8217; 401(k) plans with assets of nearly $600 billion under the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is neither appropriate nor reasonable to deprive the federal retirement fund of an investment choice that is available to its peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implications of the discriminatory legislation can&#8217;t be underestimated. The move seems like nothing but an attempt to sever Wall Street&#8217;s ties to the Chinese market. This approach of politicizing rational financial investment decisions is clearly against the laws of economic and financial development, and it will only harm the interests of TSP participants in the end.</p>
<p>For any farsighted investors, the value of China&#8217;s A shares has become so clear these days given, the relatively low valuations on the Chinese mainland stock markets, especially as US stocks keep rising to record highs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, a growing preference for the Chinese capital market could be totally justified based on recent studies and investment research papers from around the world.</p>
<p>Moreover, the continued opening-up of China&#8217;s financial sector is the opportunity global investors can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t miss when it comes to sharing the country&#8217;s development dividends. For instance, foreign ownership limits for futures, mutual funds and securities firms will all be removed next year to welcome global investors including the TSP and other American retirement funds to better tap the Chinese market.</p>
<p>It would be regrettable in the end if the TSP changes its decision under political pressure in Washington. After all, a growing number of foreign institutions are interested in and bullish on investment opportunities in China&#8217;s equities markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to media reports, a number of pension funds from Australia, Sweden and Canada have had portfolios in A shares through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors program. It is believed that with the expansion of investment channels, A shares will become more and more attractive to foreign institutional investors.</p>
