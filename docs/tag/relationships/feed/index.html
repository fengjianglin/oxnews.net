<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A picture of the horse head. Photo: Li Hao/GT </p>
<p>Nearly 160 years ago, British and French troops broke into Yuanmingyuan (the Old Summer Palace) and stole many valuable cultural relics, including 12 bronze zodiac head statues that were part of the palace&#8217;s water clock fountain.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, seven of the bronze statues &#8211; the horse, ox, monkey, tiger, pig, rat and rabbit &#8211; were gathered together at the National Museum of China and displayed in the long-lost looted treasure exhibition to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<p><strong>Exquisite workmanship</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bronze horse head statue is in the fourth part of the south side of the 12 bronze statues that stood outside the Haitang Hall of the West Building of the Yuanmingyuan Garden in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The 12 zodiac animal head fountain sprayed water according to the 12 hours the statues represented. At noon every day, when the bronze horse head statue representing &#8220;noon&#8221; sprayed water, the other 11 bronze statues sprayed at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed by the Italian artist Giuseppe Castiglione during the Emperor Qianlong period in the Qing Dynasty, the bronze statues blend Eastern and Western art styles and are an extraordinary testament to ancient Chinese art. They were based on the Western hydraulic clock and were driven by hydraulic power, which is a sophisticated design.</p>
<p>The horse&#8217;s head was made using various techniques such as a lost wax method and a riveting process. The horse&#8217;s look is vivid with its opened mouth and perfect depiction of hair, showing a very high level of craftsmanship. The material of the horse is refined red copper and it has not rusted despite being hundreds of years old.</p>
<p><strong>Finally acquired</strong></p>
<p>The bronze statues had a turbulent time before being returned to the motherland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September 2007, Macao casino tycoon Stanley Ho Hung-sun bought the horse head statue for HK$69.1 million ($8.84 million) at an auction held by Sotheby&#8217;s Hong Kong, ending the drift of the statue for more than 100 years. Since then, the statue has been publicly displayed in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, playing a positive role in enhancing the understanding of compatriots in the two regions regarding the culture of the motherland and promoting the spirit of patriotism. Ho later decided to donate the statue to the National Museum of China for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the PRC and the 20th anniversary of Macao&#8217;s return to the motherland. The horse head will be permanently attributed to the Yuanmingyuan management office in Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven of the 12 beasts from Yuanmingyuan are now back home, but the horse is the first to return to its original territory,&#8221; said Guan.</p>
<p>As well as the bronze horse head, the pig head was also donated by Ho after purchasing it in 2003, and he donated it to the Poly Art Museum in Beijing.</p>
<p>The bronze heads of the ox, monkey and tiger now also reside at the Poly Art Museum after the state-owned Chinese business group, China Poly Group Corporation, spent millions to buy them three at three different auctions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mouse head and rabbit head once appeared in a French museum for a short exhibition, and were later bought by the French Pinault family, owners of French conglomerate Kering, at an auction held by Christie&#8217;s in France in 2009. The two were finally returned to China and were collected by the National Museum of China thanks to a donation by the Pinault family in 2013.</p>
<p>However, the whereabouts of five of the animal heads &#8211; the dog, rooster, dragon, sheep and snake &#8211; remain unknown, Guan Qiang, deputy head of China&#8217;s relics authority, told the Global Times on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Big significance&nbsp;</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>The gradual return of the seven bronze heads represents the long journey home of China&#8217;s looted cultural relics, and spurs memories for many Chinese people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cultural relics lost overseas are an inseparable part of the Chinese cultural heritage, and patriotic compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao have played an important role in saving lost cultural relics over the past 70 years. Many of them have made tremendous contributions to retrieving lost looted cultural relics,&#8221; said Liu Yuzhu, head of the Chinese National Cultural Heritage Administration, at the ceremony.</p>
<p>The hashtag of the horse head&#8217;s return got 260 million views on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Thursday, and many Chinese netizens said that Hong Kong should learn from Macao.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ho&#8217;s high sense of patriotism to rescue the lost cultural relics and return them to the motherland is a signal that says: &#8216;Hong Kong, stop the violence and be prosperous with your motherland,'&#8221; one Chinese netizen commented on Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s donation from Macao is a slap to Hong Kong. Should Li Ka-shing do something similar?&#8221; another Chinese netizen wrote on Weibo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was overwhelmed with joy while listening to the speech at the donation ceremony and saw the bronze horse-head statue. I believe the rest of the five statues will soon return to the motherland, and I am looking forward to the exhibit of the reunion of the 12 zodiac statues,&#8221; said Zhang Zexin, a 68-year-old man from Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">The skyline at night of the Macao Special Administrative Region, China Photo: IC</p>
<p>The members of the choir who sang the &#8220;Song of the Seven Sons &#8211; Macao&#8221; to mark the Macao&#8217;s return to China reunited to sing the song again at the Ruins of St. Paul&#8217;s in Macao on Tuesday for the 20th anniversary of the event.</p>
<p>The hashtag for the choir&#8217;s reunion has earned almost 100 million views on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo as Chinese netizens shared their warm memories of the song on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was a child, it was very popular to copy lyrics, and one of them was the &#8216;Song of the Seven Sons.&#8217; At that time, I felt it was a beautiful song with a lovely melody, but I didn&#8217;t have a deeper understanding of the meaning behind it. Although 20 years have past, I was moved to tears while listening to the song again as the lyrics are so touching,&#8221; Liu Jianran, a 29-year-old civil servant in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Song of the Seven Sons&#8221; is a group of seven patriotic poems written by Wen Yiduo, a prominent Chinese poet and scholar, in 1925. Wen compared the seven ceded or leased areas in China, including the current Macao Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan Province, to seven children who were separated from the motherland.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never imagined that the poems could become songs because I thought song lyrics are supposed to have a certain rhyme. But when the song debuted at the Chinese New Year Gala of China Central Television (CCTV) in 1999, I was pleasantly surprised how they perfectly matched the melody and the words of the poem. I remembered the song was played everywhere in Beijing. &#8216;Do you know Macao has never been my real name? I have been away from you for too long, Mother. What they captured is my body, but my soul is always in your keep…'&#8221; said Wen Liming, grandson of Wen Yiduo, in an interview with CCTV 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really want to thank Mr. Wen for writing these words. They are easy to understand and sing, but also clearly explain the past and present of Macao. It works to enhance the sense of identity and belonging of Macao people to the motherland. In contrast, the general education in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has a big problem, and the rude behaviors of some young people there are really confusing and disappointing,&#8221; a netizen named Cardioid6 wrote on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Poster of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Photo: IC</p>
<p>According to a report from the Hollywood Reporter, US film director Quentin Tarantino will not be re-cutting his<br />
<em> Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em> for the Chinese mainland. Originally set for release on Friday, the film was suspended indefinitely a week before its release by Chinese regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tarantino, who has final-cut rights for the film in his contract, refused to cooperate with Chinese authorities when the film&#8217;s co-producer Bona Film Group asked him to help re-edit the film in order to re-approve the release, according to a report from film news site Cinema Blend on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Reporter reported that the suspension came after Bruce Lee&#8217;s daughter Shannon Lee made a direct appeal to China&#8217;s National Film Administration to have her father&#8217;s controversial portrayal in the film changed. No official statement about the suspension has been made by any parties involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally do not think that Shannon Lee, as one of the films&#8217; biggest critics, is the main reason stopping the film&#8217;s release in the Chinese mainland, because according to the reaction and feedback from those who have seen the film, Tarantino&#8217;s use of Bruce Lee&#8217;s image is rather biased and even an insult,&#8221; Shi Wenxue, a film critic and teacher at the Beijing Film Academy, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>The film portrays Bruce Lee as an arrogant person who claims he could have &#8220;crippled&#8221; Muhammad Ali in a fight, yet loses in a fight to Brad Pitt&#8217;s Cliff Booth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bruce Lee worked on screen to change the US stereotype of Chinese. However, after half a century, we see the expression of such a stereotype, which is unacceptable,&#8221; Shi said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shannon Lee once told The Wrap in July that she found the film &#8220;disheartening.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand they want to make the Brad Pitt character this super bad-ass who could beat up Bruce Lee. But they didn&#8217;t need to treat him in the way that white Hollywood did when he was alive.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She added that &#8220;It was really uncomfortable to sit in the theater and listen to people laugh at my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hashtag related to Shannon Lee&#8217;s dissatisfaction about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has earned 310 million views on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo as of Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bruce Lee&#8217;s overconfidence and arrogant image in the film is a typical stereotype applied to Chinese in Hollywood movies. Bruce Lee spent his whole life bringing real Chinese characters to the world, but Tarantino brought this old image into his film again, which is shameful to us Chinese,&#8221; one Chinese netizen commented on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Shi, Chinese often play the role of gang members in Chinatown, or arrogant rich second-generation Chinese in Western film and television. For example, the Asian characters in the film<br />
<em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> catered to the image many US viewers have when it comes to Asians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discrimination is also common off screen as well. For instance, Vietnamese-American actress Kelly Marie Tran, who played a role in<br />
<em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>, suffered racist attacks and personal abuse at the hands of Star Wars fans who were dissatisfied with her character in the film.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, some Chinese netizens have commented that the other reason for the suspension of the film may have been the violence on display in some scenes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quentin&#8217;s films often have a lot of swearing, bloody, violent, and erotic elements, which may cause concern among China&#8217;s reviewing authorities,&#8221; Shi said.</p>
<p>Although the film did original pass review, this is not the first time that one of the director&#8217;s films have been pulled at the last minute in the Chinese mainland. Tarantino&#8217;s<br />
<em>Django Unchained</em> debuted in mainland theaters back in 2013, but was subsequently pulled from cinemas on its first day of screening for &#8220;technical reason.&#8221;</p>
