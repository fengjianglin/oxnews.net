<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Ge Fengjin, son of Ge Daorong, a survivor of the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1080223.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanjing Massacre</a>, held a testimony meeting here on Wednesday night to convey the truth about the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 and remind people to never forget history. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Ge Fengjin, son of Ge Daorong, a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, held a testimony meeting here on Wednesday night to convey the truth about the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 and remind people to never forget history.</p>
<p>At the invitation of a few local civil groups, Ge Fengjin shared his father&#8217;s story at the meeting to mark the 82nd anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre. About 100 people attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Ge Daorong, a survivor of the massacre, was only 10 years old when Nanjing fell to Japanese invaders. He survived by escaping into the Safety Zone during the mass killing, but his three uncles did not.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, he has devoted himself to sharing his story. As he gets older, his son has taken over.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Dec. 13, 1937, the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing and carried out the deadly Nanjing massacre, killing 300,000 of our compatriots, including my family members,&#8221; said Ge Fengjin.</p>
<p>As descendant of a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, he said he should not only remember the painful history, but also has the responsibility to tell the truth and testify to the the mass-killing, adding that he wants more young people to know and remember this part of history.</p>
<p>Sun Zhaiwei, an expert on the Nanjing Massacre and researcher at Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, delivered a speech themed &#8220;The solemn truth of Nanjing Defense Battle&#8221; at the meeting.</p>
<p>He introduced the historical background of the Nanjing Massacre, the historical truth of the Nanjing Defense Battle, from three aspects: &#8220;the capture of Nanjing is the established goal of the Japanese army,&#8221; &#8220;the heroic fight of Chinese soldiers&#8221; and &#8220;the important historical position of the battle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reviewing the truth of the battle is not to continue the hatred, Sun said, but to learn from the historical experience, be vigilant to the resurgence of Japanese militarism which has brought disasters to mankind, and work together to strive for and maintain lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Shota Naito, a postdoctoral fellow majored in history from Japan&#8217;s Meiji University, told Xinhua that he has been attending the testimony meeting of the Nanjing Massacre in Tokyo every year since 2015.</p>
<p>Each year, the organizers invite various people to talk about the massacre in different places and perspectives, which offers a rare opportunity to learn about the truth of history in Japan, he said, adding that he is concerned that some people in Japan do not know the truth of history, and some even attempt to falsify history, forget history and deny the existence of the Nanjing Massacre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time I listen to the stories with tears in my eyes, I feel sorry (for the Chinese people),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Massacre took place after the Japanese troops captured the city on Dec. 13, 1937. Over six weeks, they killed about 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers in one of the most barbaric episodes of World War II.&nbsp;</p>

(Xinhua/NEWSIS)</p>
<p>A Chinese envoy on Wednesday called on the United States and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to move toward each other and resume dialogue and engagement as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Security Council open meeting on the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a>, China&#8217;s Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun said that since the beginning of 2018, there have been positive changes in the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the peninsula issue has been steered back to the right track toward a negotiated solution through dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lately the situation on the Korean Peninsula has taken a twist, leading to renewed tensions between the DPRK and the United States, bringing the peninsula&#8217;s situation to yet another critical juncture,&#8221; said Zhang.</p>
<p>The DPRK has taken a series of positive initiatives on denuclearization, but its legitimate concerns and aspirations in respect of security and development have not been given such attention as is commensurate with its effort, and remain unanswered, said the Chinese ambassador.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an important reason behind the current deadlock in dialogue and the tensing up of the situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zhang said that in the current context, the top priority is to maintain the international consensus and momentum for a political solution to the peninsula issue, support and urge the United States and the DPRK to move toward each other, and &#8220;do everything we can to head off a dramatic reversal of the peninsula&#8217;s situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DPRK and the United States, as the main parties over the peninsula issue, should cherish the hard-won easing of the peninsula&#8217;s situation achieved through dialogue and work together in a practical effort to achieve the denuclearization of, and lasting peace on, the Korean Peninsula, he added.</p>
<p>He said the two parties, especially the United States, should take on board and respect each other&#8217;s concerns in good faith; genuinely demonstrate flexibility and goodwill; act on the consensus contained in the Singapore Joint Statement, and, by taking the phased and synchronized approach, break the deadlock and resume dialogue and engagement as soon as possible, to prevent the dialogue process from &#8220;derailing&#8221; or &#8220;backpedalling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The international community, in particular the main parties to the peninsula issue, must take an objective and impartial position, act in the service of long-term interests and the greater good and make more efforts that contribute to the relaxation of the situation, to the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and consultation and to the peninsula&#8217;s political process, so that the peninsula will not be plunged once again into tensions and confrontations, the Chinese envoy said.</p>
<p>Denuclearization negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since February&#8217;s second summit in Hanoi between the DPRK&#8217;s top leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump ended without a deal. The two leaders first met in Singapore in June 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />North Korea fired two &#8220;unidentified projectiles&#8221; on Thursday &#8211; the Thanksgiving holiday in the US &#8211; Seoul said, as nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington remain deadlocked.</p>
<p>The projectiles were fired eastwards from South Hamgyong Province and came down in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, South Korea&#8217;s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.</p>
<p>They added that the launch was carried out at 16:59 pm ­local time (08:59 GMT) &#8211; or the early hours on the east coast of the US, during one of the country&#8217;s biggest annual holidays.</p>
<p>It was also one day short of the two-year anniversary of North Korea&#8217;s first test of its Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say is capable of reaching the entire US mainland.</p>
<p>Pyongyang is banned from firing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday&#8217;s launch was the latest in a series of violations.</p>
<p>&#8220;North Korea&#8217;s repeated launches of ballistic missiles are a serious defiance to not only our country but also the international community,&#8221; he told reporters in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s launch came after Pyongyang fired what it called a &#8220;super-large multiple rocket launcher&#8221; system last month, and the JCS said the latest devices were presumed to be of a similar type. They flew 380 kilometers and reached a maximum altitude of 97 kilometers, the JCS added.</p>
<p>Nuclear negotiations between the US and North Korea have been at a standstill since the Hanoi summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un broke up in February, and Pyongyang has since demanded Washington change its approach by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Last month Pyongyang also claimed to have tested a &#8220;new type&#8221; of submarine-launched ballistic missile &#8211; a potential strategic game changer.</p>
<p>Trump has played down the recent launches, repeatedly pointing to North Korea&#8217;s moratorium on nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches as foreign policy successes for him.</p>
<p>Trump and Kim adopted a vaguely worded statement on the &#8220;complete denuclearization of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a>&#8221; at their first summit in Singapore in June 2018, but little progress has since been made.</p>
<p>North Korea is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs and lifting some of them was a key demand in Hanoi.</p>
<p>In June Trump and Kim agreed to restart working-level talks during a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone dividing the peninsula and the two sides met in Sweden in October, only for Pyongyang to walk away.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Seoul and Washington said they would postpone planned joint military exercises to ease diplomacy with North Korea, an announcement Pyongyang dismissed.</p>

<p>Throngs of weeping relatives on Thursday buried the first of 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a truck in Britain last month, in emotional ceremonies for the young victims whose deaths have rattled their rural towns.</p>
<p>The first of the remains arrived in Vietnam from London on a commercial flight on Wednesday, closing a weeks-long, agonizing wait by families eager to have their children back home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All 31 men and eight women found dead in a refrigerated trailer in Essex last month were Vietnamese, many from small towns in central Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursday several families laid their loved ones to rest after long nights of emotional vigils.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under rainy skies in central Nghe An province, scores of relatives and villagers gathered for a final farewell for Hoang Van Tiep, 18, Nguyen Van Hung, 33, two cousins who died on the truck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parents of round-faced teenager Hung were carried away from the burial on a motorbike, overcome with emotion and unable to watch. Those who stayed wailed as the coffins were lowered into the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their families have waited weeks for their bodies to come back, and took loans from the government to cover the cost of repatriation &#8211; $1,800 for ashes, or $2,900 for bodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many families opted to pay more for the bodies so they could give their children traditional burials, since cremation is rare in rural Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tragedy has shone a grim light on the dangers of illegal migration into Britain, a top spot for many young Vietnamese hoping for better lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of the victims discovered in the truck on October 23 were from central Vietnam, driven by a perceived lack of opportunity at home and helped by a sophisticated network of brokers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some families told AFP they borrowed tens of thousands of dollars to send their children to Europe. They spent several thousand more to secure a spot on the truck, promised by brokers as the safer route into Britain, where many Vietnamese end up working illegally in nail salons or on cannabis farms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vietnam has arrested at least 10 people in connection with the tragedy for people smuggling, though none have been formally charged. Several people have also been arrested in Britain, including the 25-year-old driver of the truck Maurice Robinson, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to assist illegal immigration in court this week.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern offered an official apology Thursday on the 40th anniversary of New Zealand&#8217;s worst peacetime disaster, the Mount Erebus air crash in which 257 people died.</p>
<p>An Air New Zealand DC-10 on a sightseeing flight over Antarctica slammed into remote Mount Erebus during &#8220;whiteout&#8221; conditions on the frozen continent on November 28, 1979, killing all on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;That loss, in and of itself, was huge. It sent ripples across the country &#8230; But that loss and grief was compounded. It was undeniably worsened by the events that followed,&#8221; Ardern told a commemoration service in Auckland.</p>
<p>An initial inquiry blamed pilot error but a royal commission, the most powerful judicial inquiry under New Zealand law, subsequently cleared the crew.</p>
<p>It found the airline reset the plane&#8217;s navigation systems without telling the pilots, inadvertently setting the aircraft on a collision course with the side of the mountain.</p>
<p>The report&#8217;s author, judge Peter Mahon, also accused Air New Zealand officials of telling &#8220;an orchestrated litany of lies&#8221; to cover up the mistake and keep the blame on the pilots.</p>
<p>The then prime minister Robert Muldoon attacked Mahon&#8217;s report, viewing the findings against the state-owned carrier as a blow to national prestige, and it was not ­formally tabled until 1999, 18 years after its completion.</p>
<p>Ardern said the government&#8217;s handling of the disaster&#8217;s aftermath was wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;It caused trauma on top of grief. And persecution on top of pain,&#8221; said the prime minister, who at 38 was not born when the crash occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She also said put it on record that both the government and Air New Zealand now accepted there was an error with ­navigation systems and the pilots were totally blameless for the crash.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time has come to end the piecemeal acknowledgements,&#8221; Ardern said.</p>
<p>&#8220;After 40 years, on behalf of today&#8217;s government, the time has come to apologize for the actions of an airline then in full state ownership; which ultimately caused the loss of the aircraft and the loss of those you loved.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A South Korean court on Friday sentenced the impeached President Park Geun-hye to 24 years in jail with a fine of 18 billion won (17 million US dollars) for corruption. </p>
<p>South Korea&#8217;s top court on Thursday ordered a second retrial for disgraced former president Park Geun-hye, seeking heavier punishment for illegally taking money from the country&#8217;s spy agency.</p>
<p>Park, the country&#8217;s first female president, was impeached in 2017 after huge street protests over a sprawling scandal, and already faces a separate retrial for corruption and abuse of power that could add to her 25-year jail term.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s ruling came after an appeals court reduced Park&#8217;s sentence by one year to five years in prison in proceedings for pocketing money from the National Intelligence Service.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court said in a statement that the charges dropped on appeal had &#8220;misunderstood the legal principles&#8221; and ordered Park &#8220;should be found guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The penalties in the two cases apply consecutively, meaning the 67-year-old is currently due to be approaching 100 by the time she is set to be released.</p>

<p>Some Japanese lawmakers giggled this week during a drill to practice the use of disaster prevention helmets, at least one of which was put on backwards, prompting Twitter users to question if they were making light of a life-and-death matter.</p>
<p>Video broadcast on television and other media showed Finance Minister Taro Aso smiling after donning one of the collapsible helmets.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never know when disaster will strike,&#8221; Tadamori Oshima, the lower house speaker said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drill in parliament&#8217;s lower house was the second since the kits, stowed under members&#8217; seats, were introduced in 2017.</p>
<p>Despite getting instructions on how to unfold and wear the helmets, at least one parliamentarian put his on back-to-front. Others needed a helping hand. Some Twitter users called the lawmakers&#8217; levity off-key.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Speaker [of the lower house] was talking about being on alert, but others were laughing,&#8221; said a Twitter user.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Transgender beautician Bebo Haider (behind) attends to a customer in her beauty parlor in Karachi, Pakistan, on October 15. Photo: AFP</p>
<p>Bebo Haider&#8217;s beauty parlor is bright, small, and decorated sparsely with three large photographs: transgender models who became her clients because the Karachi salon is one of the few in Pakistan which caters to them without judgment.</p>
<p>Tarawah, in a middle-class neighborhood of the sprawling southern port city, is owned and run by Haider, herself a transgender person who came to Karachi in 2003 from a small rural town in southern Sindh province with dreams of becoming a beautician.</p>
<p>It was not easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when the owner of one salon in a posh Karachi neighborhood finally decided to take a chance on her, the clients refused her services &#8211; or to return her greetings, she told AFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took two years before one salon regular finally returned her hello, she said &#8211; but the thaw, for that customer at least, was complete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;After that day she would not get her hair and makeup done by anybody else at the parlor,&#8221; Haider told AFP jubilantly, sitting in her hairdressing chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good manners win the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transgenders &#8211; also known in Pakistan as &#8220;khawajasiras,&#8221; an umbrella term denoting a third sex that includes transvestites and eunuchs &#8211; have long fought for their rights in the deeply patriarchal and conservative country.</p>
<p>Organized and politically active, in many respects they have made impressive gains.</p>
<p>In 2009 Pakistan became one of the first countries in the world to legally recognize a third sex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, Pakistan&#8217;s parliament passed a historic bill providing transgender people with the right to determine their own gender identity in all official documents, including choosing a blend of both genders.</p>
<p>A Pakistani TV channel put the country&#8217;s first transgender news anchor on air in 2018, while several have also run in elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But &#8211; despite these gains &#8211; many still live daily as pariahs, often reduced to begging and prostitution, subjected to extortion and discrimination or targeted for violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Haider fought hard to avoid that fate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once she gained a foothold with her first job, she began to grow politically active, joining transgender rights organizations and eventually becoming the president of Sabrang, one community group.</p>
<p>When a Dutch organization said it wanted to finance a project to empower the transgender community, she and a partner jumped on the chance to open their own salon &#8211; which, they say, is the first transgender owned and run beauty salon in Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never looked back,&#8221; Haider told AFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Symbol of empowerment</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transgenders are often judged, harassed or even denied entry at other salons, she and her customers told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we would sit along the ladies at the parlor, they would feel nervous, confused and even feel repulsive of us. (But) we are also human beings,&#8221; said Mahi Doll, a 21-year client of Tarawah.</p>
<p>Haider&#8217;s salon, Doll says, is more than just a safe space for her customers to get their hair and make-up done.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a symbol of transgender empowerment,&#8221; she told AFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The salon is inside a crowded market, surrounded by grocery and milk shops. When Haider first opened it, she said, neighbors were so hostile that she felt afraid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would wear tough looks when I came to the shop so that people would not dare to mess with me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She warned her clients to dress conservatively, and deployed the strategy which had worked so well before: good manners.</p>
<p>It worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever she sees us, she greets us with a good heart and she meets with everybody pleasantly,&#8221; said Mohammad Akram, the 40-year-old owner of a milk shop next to the salon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not concerned with what their gender is,&#8221; he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Do I look good?&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Many modern-day transgender people in Pakistan claim to be cultural heirs of the eunuchs who thrived at the courts of the Mughal emperors that ruled the Indian subcontinent for two centuries, until the British arrived in the 19th century and banned them.</p>
<p>Today, people who identify as transgender number at least half a million in Pakistan, according to several studies &#8211; possibly up to two million, say TransAction, a rights organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Haider and other activists helping her hope the salon is just the first step on the road to economic empowerment for their community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Awareness has started to spread now among the people that we can do (respectable) works also,&#8221; Haider said, describing initiatives such as her salon as a &#8220;practical way&#8221; of normalizing transgenders in Pakistan.</p>
<p>During AFP&#8217;s visit to Tarawah, client Mahi Doll perched in a black reclining chair to have her hair shampooed and treated, then a manicure.</p>
<p>Haider then began doing Doll&#8217;s make-up, lining her eyes darkly to match Haider&#8217;s own. &#8220;The eye makeup is the essence,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>After finishing Doll&#8217;s eyes, Haider turned back to her own reflection, reviewing herself in the mirror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look good?&#8221; she said softly, apparently to herself. &#8220;I am beautiful. Am I not?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tram drivers in the Australian city of Melbourne stopped work on Thursday, demanding higher pay and more reliable work schedules.</p>
<p>The halt of the world&#8217;s largest tram network has forced thousands of passengers onto replacement buses, following an ongoing dispute between the workers&#8217; union and private operator Yarra Trams.</p>
<p>The action took place between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. local time, with those passengers riding on a tram at 10:00 a.m. requested to disembark at the next stop.</p>
<p>As well as demanding a wage increase, the union has opposed the hiring of more part-time workers which they said undermines job security.</p>
<p>Yarra Trams said its new part-time plans will lead to diversity and inclusivity but the &#8220;actual shifts and rosters proposed are completely unsuitable for workers with child care and caring responsibilities,&#8221; Rail Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) secretary Luba Grigorovitch told the AAP on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Melbourne is famous for its 130-year-old tram network, the largest in the world with roughly 250 km of track.</p>
<p>Despite being a favourite method of transport for millions of Melburnians and international visitors every year, union representatives said the company undervalues roughly 1,200 drivers.</p>
<p>In a statement to AAP, Yarra Trams CEO Nicolas Gindt described the action as unnecessary and said that the company &#8220;remain committed to continuing negotiations to reach a positive outcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further industrial action is planned for Dec. 5 if a deal is not reached.</p>

<p>A total of 1,335 fresh recruits joined the Afghan National Army after completing military training at the army&#8217;s Kabul Military Training Center (KMTC), a military source said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The latest graduation came as Afghan security forces have intensified security operations against Taliban militants and Islamic State (IS) fighters, who have been attempting to take territory and consolidate their positions in the countryside ahead of winter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The freshly graduated soldiers, who have undergone a 12-week training course at the KMTC received certificates at the ceremony Wednesday morning, and would be deployed at the countryside to serve their people,&#8221; Capt. Barat Ali Rizae from KMTC told Xinhua.</p>
<p>The Afghan security forces remain in control of most of Afghanistan&#8217;s population centers and all of 34 provincial capitals, but Taliban insurgents hold large portions of rural areas, staging coordinated large-scale attacks against Afghan cities and districts occasionally.</p>
<p>In the series of the Afghan military training process, a total of 1,550 soldiers and military officers also graduated and joined the army rank late last month.&nbsp;</p>
