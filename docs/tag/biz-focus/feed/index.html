<p>The Hong Kong Ocean Park said on Wednesday that its net deficit for the 2018-2019 fiscal year ending June 30 widens to around 557 million Hong Kong dollars (71 million U.S. dollars), more than double of about 237 million (30 million U.S. dollars) in a fiscal year before.</p>
<p>In an annual report of financial results from July last year to June this year, Ocean Park&#8217;s visitor attendances remained stable at 5.7 million, compared with the figure of 5.8 million in 2017-2018 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The Ocean Park saw around 1,734 million Hong Kong dollars (222 million dollars) in revenue, up around 3 percent year-on-year from 1,686 million Hong Kong dollars (216 million dollars) previously, while operating costs increased to over 1,500 million Hong Kong dollars (192 million dollars).</p>

<p>The resort said the net deficit was caused by investments on new entertainment projects, repairs and maintenance expenses on facilities damaged by Typhoon Mangkhut, as well as expenses associated with new infrastructure and facilities.</p>
<p>The park pointed out that it saw a strong local attendance fueled by Hong Kong resident-exclusive promotions and a growth of individual travelers from overseas markets. The growth momentum in local and overseas individual travelers attendances was countered however by the continued decline in tour group tourists attendances which echoed the worldwide trend of personalization in travel, it said.</p>
<p>Chairman of Ocean Park Leo Kung said in the report that the resort was facing fierce competition and increasingly difficult market environment. Despite cost pressures, it&#8217;s mandatory for the park to invest in new infrastructure and entertainment offering to lift guest experience and maintain itself as an entertainment destination and tourism hotspot, he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged after cutting rates at each of the last three meetings, as officials assessed the effect of rate cuts on the US economy.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed&#8217;s policy-making committee, decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent after concluding a two-day policy meeting, in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate,&#8221; the Fed said in a statement, adding that household spending has been rising at a strong pace while business fixed investment and exports remain weak.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate,&#8221; said the statement.</p>
<p> <br />

<br />The US economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the third quarter this year, slightly up from the 2-percent growth rate in the second quarter but a sharp deceleration from 3.1 percent in the first quarter, according to the US Commerce Department.</p>
<p>The Fed has lowered interest rates three times since July, amid growing risks and uncertainties stemming from trade tensions, weakness in global growth and muted inflation pressures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our economic outlook remains favorable despite global developments and ongoing risks,&#8221; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;With our decisions through the course of the past year, we believe that monetary policy is well-positioned to serve the American people,&#8221; Powell said, adding the current stance of monetary policy &#8220;likely will remain appropriate&#8221; as long as the US economy stays on track.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The median estimate for the federal funds rate is at 1.6 percent at the end of 2020, suggesting no rate cuts or hikes in 2020, according to Fed officials&#8217; interest rate forecasts released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fed is now quite dovish &amp; given likely alteration of inflation target in 2020 this bodes well for risk assets. Powell just noted how accommodative policy is,&#8221; Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist with RSM US LLP, an audit, tax and consulting firm, tweeted Wednesday afternoon, noting the Fed strongly implied no rate hikes in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The threshold for a rate hike remains much higher than the threshold for a rate cut. Powell underscored that he still saw slack in the economy,&#8221; echoed Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, a major accounting firm, adding she still expects at least one rate cut next year.</p>
<p>However, a majority of the 31 economists recently polled by Bloomberg expect that Fed officials won&#8217;t allow the 2020 presidential election to sway their monetary policy decisions and will keep rates on hold for the next two years.</p>

<p>Following China&#8217;s ban of both direct and indirect imports of cattle and relevant products from India due to the country&#8217;s outbreak of infectious lumpy skin disease, Chinese experts urged India to improve the quality of its export products to reduce its trade deficit with China.</p>
<p>If the Chinese border inspection or any other agency finds illegally imported Indian cattle or relevant products, they will destroy the products, read an announcement on the website of the General Administration of Customs on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The new rule will likely deal a blow to India&#8217;s beef exports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although China has banned direct purchases of buffalo meat from India since 2001 following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the South Asian country, India still sells buffalo meat to China via some Southeast Asian countries, said Yang Chun, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s shipments of buffalo meat and offal to the Chinese mainland via Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, slumped 23 percent year-on-year to 14,645 containers in the first 10 months of 2019, Indian news site The Economic Times reported, citing data from the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, if India can improve the quality of its beef exports, it&#8217;s possible for India to directly sell beef to China in the future along with growing market demand,&#8221; Yang told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s beef demand is between 7 million to 8 million tons a year, with the amount of imported beef expected to reach 1.5 million tons this year, up 50 percent year-on-year, she said.</p>
<p>However, India has repeatedly complained about its trade imbalance with China.</p>
<p>To narrow the imbalance, India should think about how to improve the competitiveness of its industries, companies and products, Dai Yonghong, a professor of the Institute of South Asia Studies at Sichuan University, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;If India can produce high-quality products at good prices, why wouldn&#8217;t Chinese like them? Why wouldn&#8217;t Indian exports increase?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Bilateral trade between China and India was on the rise in 2018. China exported $76.71 billion worth of goods to India, up 12.7 percent year-on-year, while imports from India stood at $18.83 billion, up 15.2 percent year-on-year, data from the Chinese<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> showed.</p>
<p>With a total population of about 2.7 billion, the two rapidly growing Asian countries have great potential in trade and economic cooperation, Dai said, noting that &#8220;India shouldn&#8217;t rely solely on China to solve the trade imbalance problem; rather it should step up efforts to reform its own industries.&#8221;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s Ambassador to the WTO Zhang Xiangchen on Tuesday criticized the US&#8217; obstruction of the Appellate Body of the WTO, saying that it deals a severe blow to the global multilateral trade system. He made his remarks while expressing confidence that the body will restore its functionality sooner or later as the international community cannot afford to ignore justice.</p>
<p>Due to opposition from the US, the General Council on Tuesday failed to adopt a draft decision regarding the improvement of the functionality of the Appellate Body, a pillar of the WTO which settles trade disputes among members.</p>
<p>This failure means the Appellate Body will temporarily shut down, in &#8220;the most severe blow&#8221; to the multilateral trading system since its establishment, Zhang said.</p>
<p>The body was created when the WTO was founded in 1995. Its prominent feature is its independence, as it is free from political interference.</p>
<p>The current backlash the organization is experiencing will inevitably spread to the multilateral trading system, and it is not surprising that certain individuals are attempting to use their might rather than WTO adjudications to change the trade polices of other members, Zhang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does surprise me is that one member&#8217;s persistence to go their own way could finally lead to the paralysis of the whole Appellate Body. This reveals the fragility of the multilateral trading system.&#8221;</p>
<p>The paralysis of the Appellate Body may bring irreparable damage and unintended consequences to the world trade order, he said, noting that &#8220;the security and predictability we have enjoyed cannot be taken for granted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The international community cannot afford to lose justice. We have confidence that the Appellate Body will restore its functionality sooner or later,&#8221; said Zhang.</p>
<p>&#8220;We note that 117 members have called for the immediate launch of a selection process, which is strong testimony to the political will of the majority of members to restore the Appellate Body,&#8221; Zhang said. &#8220;More importantly, when reflecting on the improvement of the Appellate Body, we have to consider how to protect it from future systemic sabotage.&#8221;</p>
<p>In future dispute settlements, apart from panel proceedings, members are still entitled to the use of arbitration under Article 25 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, regardless of whether a member is happy or not, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Zhang said that China is actively working to support the EU&#8217;s vision of an appeal-arbitration model, which essentially replicates the work of the Appellate Body, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the best option,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is an interim solution that can help countries deal with their disputes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding the US&#8217; accusation of China&#8217;s massive subsidies, Zhang citied data from the Global Trade Alert database of the University of Saint Gallen which showed that in May 2019, 45 percent of all non-agricultural imports into the US had to compete with products produced by companies receiving subsidies from the US government.</p>
<p>These subsidies included financial aid, state loans, and the reduction or waiving of taxation or social insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even that 45 percent does not represent the full picture of US subsidies, because it only takes into account domestic subsidies for manufacturing companies and does not include agricultural subsidies and export incentives,&#8221; Zhang said. &#8220;And the percentage for China was 23.9 percent, roughly half that of the US.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The massive agricultural subsidies provided by developed countries including the US have been distorting the trade of agricultural products for decades, and should have been eliminated long ago, according to Zhang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China will firmly oppose the proposal of any new subsidy rules that are discriminatory in nature, he said.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s direct investment in Egypt in the first three quarters of 2019 rose by 66 percent to 74.9 million U.S. dollars, a senior Chinese diplomat told a press conference on Tuesday at Egypt&#8217;s under-construction new administrative capital city, east of Cairo.</p>
<p>Han Bing, minister counselor for commercial affairs of the Chinese Embassy in Egypt, said these Chinese investments cover several fields including domestic electric appliances, motorbike manufacturing, agriculture and others.</p>
<p>He added that among those Chinese investors in Egypt are Dayun Motorcycle, Konka, New Hope Group and Angel Yeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile some Chinese enterprises specialized in steel, medicine, textile, new energy, garbage collection, and sewage treatment are interested in the Egyptian market and related projects under discussion,&#8221; Han told reporters.</p>
<p>The Chinese diplomat praised the &#8220;great effort&#8221; made by the Egyptian government to improve Egypt&#8217;s business environment for foreign investors through issuing a series of new investment-magnet policies.</p>
<p>Trade between China and Egypt slightly declined in the first 10 months of 2019 to 10.58 billion dollars, mostly represented in Chinese exports to Egypt.</p>
<p>&#8220;China remains Egypt&#8217;s first trade partner,&#8221; Han noted.</p>
<p>Egypt&#8217;s exports to China include agricultural crops such as oranges, grapes and sugar beets, he said, adding Egypt is the top orange exporter to China with a market share of more than 40 percent.</p>
<p>Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA), a Chinese industrial developer, is currently developing an area of 7.23 square km in Egypt&#8217;s vital Suez Canal economic zone. It has completed the first phase of about 1.25 square km and is working on the second phase of some six square km in Ain Sokhna district of Suez Province, east of the capital Cairo.</p>
<p>&#8220;TEDA zone has altogether 84 enterprises including 42 manufacturing companies, and has attracted more than 1-billion-dollar investment,&#8221; Han pointed out.</p>
<p>The Chinese diplomat also referred to growing cooperation between China and Egypt under the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative that seeks common development for participating states through win-win partnerships.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Visitors view a car from German carmaker BMW at Haikou New Energy Vehicle Exhibition in Haikou, south China&#8217;s Hainan Province, Jan. 10, 2019.

<p>Sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) in China declined 43.7 percent year-on-year in November, contracting for a fifth month in a row, data from the country&#8217;s auto industry association showed on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From January to November, the production of NEVs was 1.09 million, a year-on-year increase of 3.6 percent, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Tuesday. During the same period, sales totaled 1.04 million, up 1.2 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CAAM forecast a contraction for the whole year.</p>
<p>The sharp decline in November and the lower forecast mainly reflect a government decision to cut subsidies for green cars, which hampered consumers&#8217; purchases, said an analyst, noting that 2020 will be a difficult year &#8211; and a turning point for China&#8217;s vast NEV market, the world&#8217;s largest.</p>
<p>China is expected to remove subsidies for the NEV sector in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previously, the domestic NEV market was booming but chaotic as many low-end NEVs were tailored to qualify for subsidies instead of market demand, and that era was bound to end,&#8221; Zeng Zhiling, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy LMC Automotive, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The sector will be more market-driven as government subsidies end, Zeng said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the subsidies encouraged the front-loading of consumption, especially in less-developed areas &#8211; another cause of the sharp drop, Zeng said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s NEV sector expanded robustly over the past years, with sales surging to more than 1.26 million units in 2018 from less than 10,000 in 2009. NEV sales jumped almost 62 percent last year even as the broader auto market contracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government will shift its policy in the sector from &#8216;stimulating&#8217; to &#8216;regulating&#8217; next year,&#8221; Zeng said.</p>
<p>Analysts said that despite the looming pain of a transition next year, NEV makers should be confident that government support for the sector is firm as always.</p>
<p>The<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/6.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a> released a draft plan for the domestic NEV industry on December 3, vowing to make pure electric cars a mainstream in the vehicle market. The ministry also set a target of having NEVs make up 20 percent of the country&#8217;s total sales by 2025.</p>
<p>The market has also attracted foreign players like Tesla and Volkswagen, which increased their bets in the world&#8217;s largest NEV over the past year</p>
<p>&#8220;They will further enrich customers&#8217; choices and increase competition for domestic players, that&#8217;s how the market should be,&#8221; Zeng said.</p>
<p>In November, total auto sales in China fell 3.6 percent year-on-year, a slight rebound from drops of 4 percent in October and 5.2 percent in September.</p>

<p>Authorities in Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, on Monday launched a blockchain-based electronic ID applciation which allows users to upload their electronic certificates and store them on a local government-backed blockchain platform.</p>
<p>Starting 2020, it is expected that Shenzhen residents will be able to authorize relevant government departments to obtain their information from the app, without the need to carry paper certificates when handling personal matters, according to a report from the Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As data on the platform is encrypted, traceable and cannot be revised, the app will also better protect residents&#8217; privacy, the report said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app now supports the uploading of 24 kinds of electronic information of residents, including personal ID cards and household registration documents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />U.S. leading chip manufacturer Qualcomm has unveiled two new 5G mobile platforms and the world&#8217;s first 5G-supported extended reality (XR) platform at its annual tech summit.</p>
<p>During its Snapdragon Technology Summit held here last week, Qualcomm introduced two new 5G Snapdragon mobile platforms to hundreds of participants &#8212; the flagship Snapdragon 865 and the mid-tier Snapdragon 765/765G.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform, which includes the Snapdragon X55 Modem-RF System, is a global 5G platform designed to deliver unmatched connectivity and performance for the next generation of devices, according to Qualcomm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snapdragon 865 supports the world&#8217;s most advanced 5G connectivity and features, raising the bar for what a mobile device should be,&#8221; said Alex Katouzian, senior vice president and general manager of the Mobile Business Unit at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.</p>
<p>Devices based on the Snapdragon 865 are expected to be commercially available in the first quarter of 2020, according to Qualcomm.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon 765/765G brings integrated 5G connectivity, artificial intelligence (AI) processing and select Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite Gaming experiences, Katouzian said.</p>
<p>Apart from advanced 5G mobile platforms, the company also announced the world&#8217;s first 5G-supported XR platform, named Snapdragon XR2, which unites Qualcomm&#8217;s 5G and AI innovations with the leading XR technology, and enables a new era of augmented, virtual and mixed reality experiences that are more immersive, intelligent and connected.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon XR2 platform is packed with significant performance improvements compared to Qualcomm&#8217;s current widely adopted XR platform in terms of CPU and GPU performance, video bandwidth, higher resolution and AI improvement, said the company.</p>
<p>It is the world&#8217;s first XR platform to support seven concurrent cameras and a dedicated computer vision processor, and enable low latency camera pass-through to unlock true mixed reality, which allows users to see, interact and create a hybrid of the virtual and real world while wearing a virtual reality device, said Qualcomm.</p>
<p>At the summit, Qualcomm also announced its new 3D sonic fingerprint technology which allows for increased security via simultaneous two-finger authentication, increased speed and ease of use, and a broad Qualcomm Snapdragon Compute platform portfolio which brings long battery life, accelerated AI performance and lightning-fast connectivity to fan-less, thin and light designs for modern computing.</p>
<p>&#8220;5G will open new and exciting opportunities to connect, compute, and communicate in ways we&#8217;ve yet to imagine, and we are happy to be a key player driving the adoption of 5G around the world,&#8221; said Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon.</p>
<p>Defining the role of Qualcomm as an enabler of mobile ecosystem and partnerships, Amon said that 5G has unlocked an era of the &#8220;Invention Age.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinese central government will support the efforts of South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province in learning and applying the trade rules of the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions (SARs) to its free trade zones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also supports the two SARs to take part in the consumption upgrade and market system building of other cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA).</p>
<p>The comment was made by officials of<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> (MOFCOM) at a press conference on Monday in Beijing. It shows the firm support of the central government in deepening cooperation between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong to help the latter cushion against the downward economic pressure caused by months of unrest, observers said.</p>
<p>Ren Hongbin, AN assistant minister of commerce, said that MOFCOM has set up a special economic and trade group for GBA construction to study how to facilitate the free flow of investment and trade among Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preferential measures that expand the opening-up of the mainland market under the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) will also be put into trial practice in the GBA, according to Ren.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEPA is the first trade agreement between the mainland and the Hong Kong SAR, covering four areas, trade in goods, trade in services, investment, and economic and technical cooperation.</p>
<p>Liang Haiming, a Hong Kong-based economist, said that the central government&#8217;s efforts could be a boost for both Guangdong Province and the two SARs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Promoting trade and personnel exchanges in the GBA can encourage more Hong Kong and Macao residents to work and live in Guangdong,&#8221; Liang told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>The ongoing social unrest has taken a toll on Hong Kong&#8217;s economy, hurting its retail and tourism industries.</p>

<p>China officially separated the energy transport business from the big three state oil companies on Monday by establishing a corporation known as the China Oil &amp; Gas Piping Network Corp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Premier Li Keqiang stressed that the establishment of the new enterprise should promote reform and innovation, and improve the efficiency of the allocation of oil and gas, in a bid to better serve national strategies and improve people&#8217;s welfare.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a significant step in the restructuring of China&#8217;s energy sector, analysts said, making it more open and attractive to competitive private-sector players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new company will specialize in financing, building and operating long-distance oil and natural gas pipelines and dispatch facilities, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Monday.</p>
<p>As an essential part of the reform of natural gas industry, it could help form open upstream and downstream markets while controlling the middle segment, which deals with transportation, said Chen Zhanming, an associate professor of the School of Applied Economics at Renmin University of China.</p>
<p>It offers non-discriminatory access to participants from different sectors to enter the upstream and downstream ends of the industry, Chen said, by removing their concerns about transporting energy to consumers.</p>
<p>Industry insiders said more private companies will be able to participate in China&#8217;s booming gas market, which for years has been monopolized by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Some observers, however, expressed concerns that SOEs&#8217; financial conditions may be affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their income from natural gas businesses account for a steady share of their total revenues. About 40 percent of the new group&#8217;s shares are controlled by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. The big three oil companies hold the rest &#8211; PetroChina with 30 percent, Sinopec with 20 percent and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) with 10 percent, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relevant assets of the three SOEs, including natural gas pipeline networks, gas storage facilities and LNG terminals, will be transferred to the new group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an overhaul for the natural gas industry,&#8221; a source close to the reform agenda said, noting that the creation of an independent entity will improve efficiency and make the market more transparent. By introducing private companies, it will also accelerate the construction of basic infrastructure for energy sectors.</p>
<p>As of the end of 2018, China had 96,000 kilometers of oil and gas pipelines &#8211; 63 percent built by PetroChina, 31 percent by Sinopec and 6 percent by CNOOC. </p>
<p>However, the establishment of a new group that specializes in energy pipelines could mean the interests of the three oil giants may suffer. An employee of PetroChina, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Global Times that he is worried about whether the reform agenda and asset transfer can go forward smoothly, without encountering opposition from the SOEs.&nbsp;</p>
