<p>Scientists in the United States have detected new genetic clues about hibernation, which may lead to better understanding and treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>The study published on Tuesday in the journal Cell Reports showed that hibernators may have evolved ways to &#8220;turn off&#8221; specific genetic elements controlling the activity of obesity genes compared to mammals that do not hibernate.</p>
<p>Hibernators like bear usually pack on massive weight during hibernation so they can survive months of slumber, but to scientists&#8217; surprise, they are as fit as ever after they reemerge.</p>
<p><center><br />

<p>The researchers from the University of Utah focused on four hibernating mammals found in diverse habitats worldwide: the ground squirrel, little brown bat, gray mouse lemur, and lesser Madagascar hedgehog tenrec.</p>
<p>After comparing their genomes, they concluded that those mammals had independently evolved short, non-coding DNA snippets called parallel accelerated regions, which are disproportionately located near genes linked to obesity in humans.</p>
<p>Then they examined genes involved in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a human genetic disorder that triggers insatiable appetite and leads to morbid obesity.</p>
<p> <br />

<p>It turns out that genes linked to PWS also have more hibernator accelerated regions than genes not associated with the syndrome. So they suggested those DNA snippets may invalidate genetic elements causing the metabolic disorder.</p>
<p>The newly discovered elements could improve our ability to learn how to evaluate and control obesity risks in humans by uncovering candidate master regulatory switches in the genome for controlling mammalian obesity, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our results show that hibernator accelerated regions are enriched near genes linked to obesity in studies of hundreds of thousands of people, as well as near genes linked to a syndromic form of obesity,&#8221; said the paper&#8217;s co-author Elliot Ferris, a bioinformatician at the University of Utah.</p>
<p>The Utah researchers identified a total of 364 potential genetic elements that could have a role in regulating hibernation and obesity. They are currently testing those components in laboratory mice using gene-editing tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />An international team of researchers have discovered the structure of an enzyme that is essential for photosynthesis, revealing how light activates the enzyme to make chlorophyll, the green pigment for life.</p>
<p>To date, scientists have only found three light-activated enzymes in nature. The study focused on protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) that is responsible for making chlorophyll in plants.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Manchester, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University of Technology and other research institutions reported in the journal Nature that the revealed structure shows how the POR enzyme captures light and channels it to drive a crucial biological reaction involved in chlorophyll synthesis.</p>
<p>They found that light activates protochlorophyllide, a precursor of chlorophyll, within the enzyme to drive the breaking of chemical bonds and creating reactions.</p>
<p>The team said the research provides an understanding of the structural basis for harnessing light energy to drive catalysis in the enzyme, which is crucial for light-to-chemical energy conversion and energy flow in the biosphere.</p>
<p>It may also open the door to the bioengineering of artificial light-activated enzymes in the future, said the researchers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />Exposure to e-cigarette smoke causes mice to develop lung cancer, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </p>
<p>Researchers from New York University (NYU) School of Medicine found that nine of 40 (22.5 percent) mice exposed to e-cigarette smoke with nicotine for 54 weeks developed lung cancer, and 23 of them developed bladder hyperplasia, genetic changes that may lead to abnormal tissue growth seen in cancer. </p>
<p>By contrast, only one of the 17 mice exposed to no-nicotine e-cigarette smoke developed hyperplasia. </p>
<p>Previously, researchers argued that chemicals added during the curing of tobacco convert nicotine into nitrosamine &#8212; a carcinogen for mice and humans. </p>
<p>Although the chemicals are 95 percent lower in e-cigarettes, the new study showed that mammalian cells could directly react with nicotine to form nitrosamine, then resulting in DNA damage. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our next step in this line of work will be to expand the number of mice studied, to shorten and prolong e-cigarette exposure time, and to further investigate the genetic changes caused by e-cigarette smoke,&#8221; said the paper&#8217;s co-author Herbert Lepor at NYU. </span></p>

<p>Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU) scientists have developed an optical micro-vacuum cleaner that keeps homes clean from harmful particles. The results of the study were published in Scientific Reports magazine.</p>
<p>The new vacuum cleaner eliminates harmful nanoparticles by manipulating their movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of an optical vacuum cleaner is quite simple. A mesoscale dielectric micro-particle is used &#8211; in this case, it&#8217;s an equilateral cuboid &#8211; with a relative index of refraction of about two. In this case, the optical radiation incident on the particle will be localised, and focused near its shadow surface,&#8221; TPU Electronic Engineering Professor Oleg Minin, the project manager, said.</p>
<p>According to the scientist, if a small hole is made in a micro-particle, then, under the influence of optical forces, nanoparticles will be &#8220;drawn into&#8221; it.</p>
<p>Since the micro-particle has a size ranging from one to 10 incident radiation wavelengths, this approach will allow the creation of chips featuring micro-systems for environmental cleaning.</p>
<p>The Russian scientists participated with colleagues from China&#8217;s Jilin University and Israel&#8217;s Ben-Gurion University in the study.</p>
<p>The results of the study were published in Scientific Reports magazine.</p>

<p>Chinese researchers have disclosed that gray wolves from the country&#8217;s different regions derived from different lineages, according to a recent study paper published in the journal iScience. </p>
<p>Gray wolves, or Canis lupus, are one of many widely distributed terrestrial mammals in Eurasia, North America and North Africa. </p>
<p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) sequenced six specimens from wolf skins around the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang and Jilin. </p>
<p>They found that the gray wolves from the first three provinces derived from a single lineage, distinct from those from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and northern regions. </p>
<p>The results also indicated that the interspecific gene flow in the genus of Canis likely played an important role in its speciation. </p>
<p>The research approach on ancient DNA can be a remarkable reference for animal museums, said the paper.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Franz Josef Land archipelago. Photo: sputniknews.com</p>
<p>The thawing of submarine permafrost leads to massive emissions of greenhouse methane, which may change the climate in the future. Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU)&#8217;s research in the Seas of the Eastern Arctic is aimed at assessing the scale of these processes. This is what the press service of TPU told Sputnik.</p>
<p>Permafrost Thawing and Methane Anomalies</p>
<p>On 16 September, TPU scientists aboard the research vessel Akademik M. Keldysh left from Arkhangelsk for another expedition to the Seas of the Eastern Arctic together with the staff of the Pacific Oceanological Institute (POI) and the Institute of Oceanology. The expedition is aimed at identifying the biogeochemical and environmental consequences of permafrost thawing in the Eastern Arctic Seas and along the Northern Sea Route.</p>
<p>In recent decades, studies of permafrost thaw under the influence of climate change have been carried out mainly on land.</p>
<p>A joint study by TPU and TOI RAS showed that in the last 30 years, the rate of permafrost thawing in the Seas of the Eastern Arctic has doubled compared to previous centuries, and reached 18 centimetres per year. This means that during the modern period of warming, the roof of the submarine permafrost has deepened into the stability zone of hydrates (&#8220;hard&#8221; methane), which has led to their destabilisation and massive emissions of greenhouse methane.</p>
<p>TPU scientists led by Professor Natalya Shakhova have proven that submarine permafrost is unstable. Gigantic methane reserves, including hydrates, are being de-mothballed, and the world&#8217;s largest anomalies of dissolved and atmospheric methane are being formed. The research results were published in the Science magazine in 2010, and in Nature Geoscience, and Nature Communications in 2014 and 2017.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 2018, researchers discovered an anomaly of dissolved methane with concentrations 10,000 times higher than the background ones.</p>
<p>Why it&#8217;s Necessary to Study Processes on the Arctic Shelf</p>
<p>According to scientists, first of all, studying permafrost thawing processes helps assess geological risks.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t consider the results of the study of the submarine permafrost state, geological and environmental disasters (such as accidents in the Gulf of Mexico) causing irreparable damage may occur during exploration and industrial activity&#8221;, Igor Semiletov, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Head of Arctic Research at TOI and Professor of the TPU Department of Geology, told Sputnik.</p>
<p>He noted that new risk zones appear during the installation of platforms with nuclear reactors on the Arctic shelf in places with a complex structure of submarine permafrost and manifestations of cold vultures (sections of the ocean or sea floor, where gases are released from the underlying rock formations) and hydrothermal activity.</p>
<p>Secondly, such studies help assess possible climatic effects. For example, if 1-5% of the hydrates of the Eastern Arctic Seas shelf, where more than 80% of all submarine permafrost is located, enter the atmosphere, the densification of atmospheric methane can affect the planet&#8217;s climate.</p>
<p>Thirdly, scientists will be able to predict the environmental effects of permafrost thawing. According to the results published in Nature Geoscience in 2016, extreme acidification of water due to the oxidation of permafrost&#8217;s erosive carbon and dissolved methane&#8217;s fractioning to carbon dioxide is a great danger. This process leads to significant environmental consequences, including the dissolution of carbonate-containing shells and shells of marine mollusks, which leads to their extinction.</p>
<p>&#8220;To clarify the environmental and possible climatic consequences of the massive release of methane from sediments into the water column and atmosphere, it&#8217;s necessary to continue comprehensive research in the Seas of the Eastern Arctic; this requires the creation of a separate federal or international programme, including the development of integrated observations in the Siberian sector of the Arctic with research vessels, drifting platforms (including the drift on the Kapitan Dranitsyn icebreaker planned for 2019-2020), aircraft and drones&#8221;, Igor Semiletov pointed out.</p>
<p>Leading scientists from institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow State University, NArFU, universities in Sweden, the Netherlands, Great Britain, the USA, and Italy will take part in the research.</p>

<p>China on Monday released a management regulation on human genetic resources, banning their commercial trade. The measure also requires foreign organizations to cooperate with the Chinese side when conducting research on the country&#8217;s human genetic resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts hailed the move claiming it will promote rational utilization of human genetic resources and contribute to global biomedical development.</p>
<p>Last month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signed a state council order promulgating the regulation which is expected to go into effect on July 1, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
<p>The regulation stipulates that China prohibits the sale or purchase of human genetic resources. However, resources provided for scientific research with reasonable expenses shall not be deemed as illegal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulation also mandates the implementation of a declaration and registration system for genetic families and human genetic resources in specific regions. International organizations and institutions will be expected to cooperate with the Chinese when using domestic human genetic resources for scientific research.</p>
<p>The information on human genetic resources needs to be filed or backed up when used publicly or provided to overseas organizations, persons, or institutions established or controlled by foreign staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulation stipulates that all information should pass security checks if it is suspected to affect China&#8217;s public health, national security, and interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conducting biotech research and development activities or clinical tests must observe proper research and clinical application management laws, administrative, and relevant state regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulation is focused on protecting China&#8217;s human genetic resources and preventing illegal access to use them for biotechnology research and development, such as the gene-edited twins case, the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/12.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Justice</a> and<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/5.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Science and Technology</a> said in a press release sent to the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese scientist He Jiankui in November 2018 claimed to have created the world&#8217;s first gene-edited twins immune to HIV, causing a global ethics whirlwind of condemnation and scorn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This followed the news of Shenzhen-listed genomics company BGI Genomic in October that was conducting an illegal genetics study with a foreign institute and exporting human genetic resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is home to the largest and most complete human genetic resources representing the East Asian population. Protecting and utilizing such resources will not only serve the health and well-being of the Chinese but also around the world, said Zhao Guoping, an academician from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulation also provides a legal guarantee for Chinese scientific researchers to enhance abilities and improve research levels by using human genetic resources to engage in joint efforts with the world&#8217;s greatest research institutions, said Zhan Qimin, vice president of Peking University.</p>
<p>Human genetic resources are materials and information that can be used alone or in combination to identify human body characteristics. They are essential guarantees for the development of disease prevention, intervention, and control, and have become the strategic, public welfare and vital resources for health and life safety, said Jin Li, vice president of Fudan University.</p>

<p>China is promoting domestically-developed hybrid wheat for commercial purposes, a field which China is way ahead in the world, experts said.</p>
<p>China developed the two-line hybrid wheat system recently. One of the system&#8217;s products, Jingmai series hybrid wheat, began large-scale promotion around the country last year, reported the Beijing-based Science and Technology Daily on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The two-line hybrid technique is often used in hybrid rice and wheat. It can increase wheat production by 20 percent.</p>
<p>It was developed by the Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences&#8217; Engineering and Technique Research Center for Hybrid Wheat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to have half of Chinese wheat farmers use hybrid wheat,&#8221; Zhao Changping, the institute&#8217;s director, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>By 2020, 67,000 hectares of agricultural land is expected to raise hybrid wheat, according to Chen Zhaobo, general manager of the China National Seed Group&#8217;s Hybrid Wheat Seed Industry (Beijing) Co Ltd, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>In terms of the technology, &#8220;China is leading the world by a large margin,&#8221; Zhao said.</p>
<p>The hybrid wheat technology has been a challenge for the past 60 years. Scientists faced problems such as production and breeding inconsistencies. But China&#8217;s two-line hybrid wheat system has solved that problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is adaptive and stable, meaning it is resistant to diseases, stress, drought, pests, saline and alkali,&#8221; Zhao said, adding that farmers can also save 30 to 50 percent of water, use 30 percent less seeds, and use the seeds longer before they begin to deteriorate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The demand for hybrid wheat exceeds the supply. I have sold 25,000 kilograms of Jingmai 9 seeds in the past year. It will not be a problem to sell 200,000 to 250,000 kilograms this year based on its performance. I am worried that we may not have enough seeds,&#8221; Wang Xinchao, a Langfang-based agricultural sales manager, was quoted by the Science and Technology Daily as saying.</p>
<p>To meet the demand, the Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences is cooperating with the government of Dengzhou, Central China&#8217;s Henan Province to establish an industrialization base for the hybrid wheat project. It&#8217;s aiming to produce 15 million kilograms of hybrid wheat seeds for 134,000 hectares, the Science and Technology Daily reported.</p>
<p>The base is operating and successfully harvested a batch of hybrid wheat on May 29, according to a statement released by Henan Province&#8217;s Development and Investment Administration Center of Land and Resources.</p>
<p>The hybrid wheat has been exported to several countries and performing well, Zhao said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s hybrid wheat has been harvested on a large scale in Pakistan since 2009, with an average yield of 30 percent more than the yield of local wheat, marking the first step in hybrid wheat internationalization, the Science and Technology Daily reported in 2013.</p>
