<p>Scientists in the United States have detected new genetic clues about hibernation, which may lead to better understanding and treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>The study published on Tuesday in the journal Cell Reports showed that hibernators may have evolved ways to &#8220;turn off&#8221; specific genetic elements controlling the activity of obesity genes compared to mammals that do not hibernate.</p>
<p>Hibernators like bear usually pack on massive weight during hibernation so they can survive months of slumber, but to scientists&#8217; surprise, they are as fit as ever after they reemerge.</p>
<p><center><br />

<p>The researchers from the University of Utah focused on four hibernating mammals found in diverse habitats worldwide: the ground squirrel, little brown bat, gray mouse lemur, and lesser Madagascar hedgehog tenrec.</p>
<p>After comparing their genomes, they concluded that those mammals had independently evolved short, non-coding DNA snippets called parallel accelerated regions, which are disproportionately located near genes linked to obesity in humans.</p>
<p>Then they examined genes involved in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a human genetic disorder that triggers insatiable appetite and leads to morbid obesity.</p>
<p> <br />

<p>It turns out that genes linked to PWS also have more hibernator accelerated regions than genes not associated with the syndrome. So they suggested those DNA snippets may invalidate genetic elements causing the metabolic disorder.</p>
<p>The newly discovered elements could improve our ability to learn how to evaluate and control obesity risks in humans by uncovering candidate master regulatory switches in the genome for controlling mammalian obesity, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our results show that hibernator accelerated regions are enriched near genes linked to obesity in studies of hundreds of thousands of people, as well as near genes linked to a syndromic form of obesity,&#8221; said the paper&#8217;s co-author Elliot Ferris, a bioinformatician at the University of Utah.</p>
<p>The Utah researchers identified a total of 364 potential genetic elements that could have a role in regulating hibernation and obesity. They are currently testing those components in laboratory mice using gene-editing tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />An international team of researchers have discovered the structure of an enzyme that is essential for photosynthesis, revealing how light activates the enzyme to make chlorophyll, the green pigment for life.</p>
<p>To date, scientists have only found three light-activated enzymes in nature. The study focused on protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) that is responsible for making chlorophyll in plants.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Manchester, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University of Technology and other research institutions reported in the journal Nature that the revealed structure shows how the POR enzyme captures light and channels it to drive a crucial biological reaction involved in chlorophyll synthesis.</p>
<p>They found that light activates protochlorophyllide, a precursor of chlorophyll, within the enzyme to drive the breaking of chemical bonds and creating reactions.</p>
<p>The team said the research provides an understanding of the structural basis for harnessing light energy to drive catalysis in the enzyme, which is crucial for light-to-chemical energy conversion and energy flow in the biosphere.</p>
<p>It may also open the door to the bioengineering of artificial light-activated enzymes in the future, said the researchers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />Exposure to e-cigarette smoke causes mice to develop lung cancer, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </p>
<p>Researchers from New York University (NYU) School of Medicine found that nine of 40 (22.5 percent) mice exposed to e-cigarette smoke with nicotine for 54 weeks developed lung cancer, and 23 of them developed bladder hyperplasia, genetic changes that may lead to abnormal tissue growth seen in cancer. </p>
<p>By contrast, only one of the 17 mice exposed to no-nicotine e-cigarette smoke developed hyperplasia. </p>
<p>Previously, researchers argued that chemicals added during the curing of tobacco convert nicotine into nitrosamine &#8212; a carcinogen for mice and humans. </p>
<p>Although the chemicals are 95 percent lower in e-cigarettes, the new study showed that mammalian cells could directly react with nicotine to form nitrosamine, then resulting in DNA damage. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our next step in this line of work will be to expand the number of mice studied, to shorten and prolong e-cigarette exposure time, and to further investigate the genetic changes caused by e-cigarette smoke,&#8221; said the paper&#8217;s co-author Herbert Lepor at NYU. </span></p>

<p>Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU) scientists have developed an optical micro-vacuum cleaner that keeps homes clean from harmful particles. The results of the study were published in Scientific Reports magazine.</p>
<p>The new vacuum cleaner eliminates harmful nanoparticles by manipulating their movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of an optical vacuum cleaner is quite simple. A mesoscale dielectric micro-particle is used &#8211; in this case, it&#8217;s an equilateral cuboid &#8211; with a relative index of refraction of about two. In this case, the optical radiation incident on the particle will be localised, and focused near its shadow surface,&#8221; TPU Electronic Engineering Professor Oleg Minin, the project manager, said.</p>
<p>According to the scientist, if a small hole is made in a micro-particle, then, under the influence of optical forces, nanoparticles will be &#8220;drawn into&#8221; it.</p>
<p>Since the micro-particle has a size ranging from one to 10 incident radiation wavelengths, this approach will allow the creation of chips featuring micro-systems for environmental cleaning.</p>
<p>The Russian scientists participated with colleagues from China&#8217;s Jilin University and Israel&#8217;s Ben-Gurion University in the study.</p>
<p>The results of the study were published in Scientific Reports magazine.</p>

<p>Chinese researchers have disclosed that gray wolves from the country&#8217;s different regions derived from different lineages, according to a recent study paper published in the journal iScience. </p>
<p>Gray wolves, or Canis lupus, are one of many widely distributed terrestrial mammals in Eurasia, North America and North Africa. </p>
<p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) sequenced six specimens from wolf skins around the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang and Jilin. </p>
<p>They found that the gray wolves from the first three provinces derived from a single lineage, distinct from those from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and northern regions. </p>
<p>The results also indicated that the interspecific gene flow in the genus of Canis likely played an important role in its speciation. </p>
<p>The research approach on ancient DNA can be a remarkable reference for animal museums, said the paper.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Franz Josef Land archipelago. Photo: sputniknews.com</p>
<p>The thawing of submarine permafrost leads to massive emissions of greenhouse methane, which may change the climate in the future. Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU)&#8217;s research in the Seas of the Eastern Arctic is aimed at assessing the scale of these processes. This is what the press service of TPU told Sputnik.</p>
<p>Permafrost Thawing and Methane Anomalies</p>
<p>On 16 September, TPU scientists aboard the research vessel Akademik M. Keldysh left from Arkhangelsk for another expedition to the Seas of the Eastern Arctic together with the staff of the Pacific Oceanological Institute (POI) and the Institute of Oceanology. The expedition is aimed at identifying the biogeochemical and environmental consequences of permafrost thawing in the Eastern Arctic Seas and along the Northern Sea Route.</p>
<p>In recent decades, studies of permafrost thaw under the influence of climate change have been carried out mainly on land.</p>
<p>A joint study by TPU and TOI RAS showed that in the last 30 years, the rate of permafrost thawing in the Seas of the Eastern Arctic has doubled compared to previous centuries, and reached 18 centimetres per year. This means that during the modern period of warming, the roof of the submarine permafrost has deepened into the stability zone of hydrates (&#8220;hard&#8221; methane), which has led to their destabilisation and massive emissions of greenhouse methane.</p>
<p>TPU scientists led by Professor Natalya Shakhova have proven that submarine permafrost is unstable. Gigantic methane reserves, including hydrates, are being de-mothballed, and the world&#8217;s largest anomalies of dissolved and atmospheric methane are being formed. The research results were published in the Science magazine in 2010, and in Nature Geoscience, and Nature Communications in 2014 and 2017.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 2018, researchers discovered an anomaly of dissolved methane with concentrations 10,000 times higher than the background ones.</p>
<p>Why it&#8217;s Necessary to Study Processes on the Arctic Shelf</p>
<p>According to scientists, first of all, studying permafrost thawing processes helps assess geological risks.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t consider the results of the study of the submarine permafrost state, geological and environmental disasters (such as accidents in the Gulf of Mexico) causing irreparable damage may occur during exploration and industrial activity&#8221;, Igor Semiletov, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Head of Arctic Research at TOI and Professor of the TPU Department of Geology, told Sputnik.</p>
<p>He noted that new risk zones appear during the installation of platforms with nuclear reactors on the Arctic shelf in places with a complex structure of submarine permafrost and manifestations of cold vultures (sections of the ocean or sea floor, where gases are released from the underlying rock formations) and hydrothermal activity.</p>
<p>Secondly, such studies help assess possible climatic effects. For example, if 1-5% of the hydrates of the Eastern Arctic Seas shelf, where more than 80% of all submarine permafrost is located, enter the atmosphere, the densification of atmospheric methane can affect the planet&#8217;s climate.</p>
<p>Thirdly, scientists will be able to predict the environmental effects of permafrost thawing. According to the results published in Nature Geoscience in 2016, extreme acidification of water due to the oxidation of permafrost&#8217;s erosive carbon and dissolved methane&#8217;s fractioning to carbon dioxide is a great danger. This process leads to significant environmental consequences, including the dissolution of carbonate-containing shells and shells of marine mollusks, which leads to their extinction.</p>
<p>&#8220;To clarify the environmental and possible climatic consequences of the massive release of methane from sediments into the water column and atmosphere, it&#8217;s necessary to continue comprehensive research in the Seas of the Eastern Arctic; this requires the creation of a separate federal or international programme, including the development of integrated observations in the Siberian sector of the Arctic with research vessels, drifting platforms (including the drift on the Kapitan Dranitsyn icebreaker planned for 2019-2020), aircraft and drones&#8221;, Igor Semiletov pointed out.</p>
<p>Leading scientists from institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow State University, NArFU, universities in Sweden, the Netherlands, Great Britain, the USA, and Italy will take part in the research.</p>
