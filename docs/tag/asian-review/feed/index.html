<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</p>
<p>In October 1943, Max Harris, the editor of Angry Penguins, then Australia&#8217;s leading avant garde modernist literary magazine, received a package of poems supposedly written by a deceased poet, Ern Malley. But as it turned out, Malley was a fictitious figure and the poems were in fact forged by a couple of critics by piecing together fragments from dictionaries, quotations, plays and a report about the breeding grounds of mosquitoes. The trusting Harris showered high praise on the nonexistent poet, calling him &#8220;one of the most outstanding poets that we have produced&#8221; in Australia. The hoaxers later revealed the shocking truth that the bunch of randomly concocted fake poems, which had won the loudest applause from the celebrated modernist magazine, were aimed at shaming and ridiculing the modernist literature in Australia at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Penguins could be gullible. Those poor creatures could be easily misled and fooled by some flippant teasers. But it is really astounding that the most prominent Australian media of today, such as The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and 60 Minutes, could jump in excitement at an apparently fabricated fairy tale of a convicted fraudster, Wang Liqiang, claiming to be a defecting Chinese spy who told Australia&#8217;s top-level intelligence agency, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), about &#8220;how China had funded and conducted political interference in Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong.&#8221; More surprising is that ASIO claims to be paying serious attention to an equally bizarre drama alleging some Chinese scheme to plant a Chinese-Australian car dealer, surnamed Zhao, in Canberra&#8217;s federal parliament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the most amateurish readers would gawk in disbelief at the imposter&#8217;s outlandish account that Wang, at the age of 26, had assumed important powers to make decisions and give orders related to some 007-style theatrical operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His preposterous tale is a bizarre coincidence with the conspiracy theory about the car dealer, portraying a sinister image of China threatening Australia&#8217;s security and sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cold War was over about 30 years ago, but the ghost of ideological battle has been obstinately hovering Down Under awaiting resurrection. The fact that the media and some political figures in Australia could be so excited about such implausible cloak and dagger stories is indeed embarrassingly preposterous, indicating some Australians&#8217; nostalgia and a deep-rooted antipathy toward China and the Chinese way of governance. The voracious journalistic vultures don&#8217;t need any prompting and goading to swoop upon such tittle-tattles leaked to them by some intelligence agencies with their manipulative hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul Keating, former Australian prime minister, recently said &#8220;a group of national security agencies which are now effectively running the foreign policy of the country&#8221; spoiled the &#8220;subtleties of foreign policy and the elasticity of diplomacy.&#8221; He also condemned Australian media&#8217;s sensationalism, ignoring its public duty while &#8220;preferring instead to traffic in side plays dressed up with cosmetics of sedition and risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The anti-China camp in Australia consists of only a small cluster of extremists, but they have been stirring up one wave after another of anti-China frenzy as part of a scheme connived in the US to contain and counter China&#8217;s development domestically and globally. Espousing and campaigning for Washington&#8217;s global strategy, Canberra has literally been acting as Washington&#8217;s deputy sheriff in a number of cases to secure the latter&#8217;s supremacy and hegemony in the region.</p>
<p>It serves the interest of some security agencies to invent a foreign enemy, but such reckless fabrication would only jeopardize Australia&#8217;s national interest. It is not in Australia&#8217;s interest to decouple with China, which would only lead to unforeseen economic disaster for Australia, and cost China dearly as well. In the backdrop of the current US-lunched trade war against China, it is to the benefit of both China and Australia to strengthen the collaborative partnership.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has on a number of occasions asserted that Australia-China relations could withstand any challenges. This is very positive and constructive. A more independent China policy is important for Australia in today&#8217;s world of uncertainties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This understanding resonates in Paul Keating&#8217;s speech, in which he urges Canberra to pursue a more balanced policy to manage bilateral relations with Beijing. We hope this course will not be derailed by some fraudsters and storytellers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Zhong Hua Chinese Buddhist Monastery in Lumbini. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>All planes flying from Kathmandu to Lumbini in southwestern Nepal are air minibuses. Shortly after the aircrafts take off, what heaves in sight is usually undulating mountains on the edge of the mighty Himalayas. Only half an hour later, passengers could see an immense plain. It is a gateway to the core of Indian civilization. Google Maps shows the driving distance from Lumbini to New Delhi is about 800 kilometers.</p>
<p>Around 1500BC, Aryans from Central Asia invaded South Asia and occupied fertile lands in what is known today as the Ganges River Valley in India. Lumbini is located on the edge of this rich area, and Buddhism was born at this site in about 500BC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tour guide told me that Lumbini is less than 20 kilometers from the Indian border. Many China-made goods are sold in shops along the streets of nearby towns. People dressed in monk robes pass by from time to time. And in the birthplace of the Buddha, plenty of Chinese tourists can be seen.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese tourists visiting Nepal has increased phenomenally &#8211; from 5,160 in 2000 to 153,602 in 2018. And Lumbini is one of their major destinations. Zhong Hua Chinese Buddhist Monastery, with a history of more than 20 years, is the first national-level temple established overseas by the Beijing-based Buddhist Association of China.</p>
<p>As an increasing number of Buddhists from China, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asian countries visit Nepal&#8217;s Lumbini to show their respect and devotion for the Buddha, this small town, which was hardly heard of by the world for a long time in the 20th century, is now of geopolitical significance.</p>
<p>In 2011, Doha-based media Al Jazeera unveiled an unconfirmed plan of China, saying the East Asian country would invest $3 billion in Lumbini for infrastructure development. On September 19, 2013, Le Monde of France published an article, stating that the soft power competition between China and India in Lumbini was soundless but fierce as it might decide which country would become the leader of more than 400 million Buddhists of various denominations worldwide, including Mahayana and Hinayana.</p>
<p>The guide told me, based on the discovery of Indian and European archaeologists, the Indian side has confirmed that the ancient city of Kapilavastu located in present-day Piprahwa, India, was the homeland of Sakyamuni. Kapilavastu is only about 1 kilometer from the India-Nepal border line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Nepal identified present-day Tilaurakot in Nepal as the location of the historical site of Kapilavastu. In addition, legendary Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang who lived during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) recorded the Nepal-indentified location in his narrative. And there have been new findings in recent years.</p>
<p>Back to the times when Sakyamuni was alive, there wasn&#8217;t a border line. The invasion of British colonialists has left marks of &#8220;nation&#8221; in people&#8217;s mind, which can still be seen in many Asian countries. Hence, Lumbini, in addition to being a spiritual site, is also a political one. It could provide important clues for us to know present-day Asia.</p>
<p>The world heritage site is at the foot of the Himalaya mountains, which could hardly become an obstacle for people-to-people exchanges in Asia amid the advent of globalization. People from Lumbini can feel the tremendous changes that are taking place in the world. In the foreseeable future, railways and highways will cross the mountains and extend into Nepal to link the Buddhist pilgrimage site, the starting point of Buddhism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A railway that crosses China-Nepal border and links Xigaze in Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal&#8217;s capital Kathmandu is under construction. In the meantime, a railway that starts from the India-Nepal border and ends at Kathmandu is on the agenda of the Indian government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I was heading toward the airport and villages, fields, and trees passed by, I kept thinking: Does it mean China and India will shake hands at the birthplace of Buddhism if the two ancient civilizations are linked via Nepal?</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>Fresh tensions appeared Sunday between Japan and South Korea, after Seoul announced it would renew the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with Tokyo, which was originally set to end on midnight Saturday.</p>
<p>Seoul accused Tokyo of deliberately distorting the details of South Korea&#8217;s decision to keep in place the GSOMIA, and Tokyo denied on Monday it had offered an apology. The new dispute raised doubts whether Seoul&#8217;s last-minute decision would help improve bilateral ties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But from my perspective, although maintaining this military intelligence-sharing pact is far from bringing Japan-South Korea ties back to normal and settling fundamental contradictions between the two sides, it is at least a positive sign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been reported that foreign ministers of the two Northeast Asian nations agreed Saturday to arrange a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1046164.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Jae-in</a> in late December. This can be seen as a major development coming about as a result of the renewal of GSOMIA.</p>
<p>Seoul&#8217;s decision can&#8217;t be seen as a compromise with Tokyo. It is a result of tremendous pressure created by Washington to bring about a thaw among its major allies in the region. As the Japanese government has shown no sign to ease export restrictions against South Korea or to add South Korea back to its white list of preferred trading partners, many people in Japan believe the outcome proves that Japan has scored a diplomatic victory.</p>
<p>But in South Korea&#8217;s final decision, US influence has played a key role. Several high-level US officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper, visited South Korea recently, ratcheting up pressure on the Blue House and hinting that terminating GSOMIA would harm the US-South Korea alliance. Moreover, the US Senate unanimously passing a resolution reaffirming the significance of GSOMIA on Thursday shows how important the issue is for Washington.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the agreement between Japan and South Korea were terminated, the incident would have cast a shadow on trilateral relations among Washington, Tokyo and Seoul, and could have impacted US presence in Northeast Asia, which is the last scenario the US would like to see. So the US has drawn a clear bottom line: Maintaining the stability of military ties between Japan and South Korea and avoiding chaos in terms of US own strategic deployment in Northeast Asia.</p>
<p>South Korean strategy toward GSOMIA is to &#8220;retreat in order to advance.&#8221; When the country&#8217;s presidential office announced the renewal of the pact, it also emphasized Seoul&#8217;s right to terminate it at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move showed some South Korean respect for the US while reminding Tokyo that it is Seoul which holds the initiative.</p>
<p>The Moon administration&#8217;s decision on the GSOMIA went against mainstream public opinion in South Korea, and may affect the government&#8217;s popularity. According to a Gallup Korea poll released Friday, 51 percent respondents were opposed to the renewal of GSOMIA while merely 29 percent supported it.</p>
<p>However, Seoul took the lead in making the utmost concession and avoiding further damage to its relationship with Tokyo. This will force Japan to respond, otherwise, Japan&#8217;s image would have taken a beating among international public opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan&#8217;s indifferent response may also hurt trilateral relations between Washington, Tokyo and Seoul. From this perspective, South Korea&#8217;s concession does not mean that Japan has gained the upper hand in the standoff between the two countries.</p>
<p>While Washington was piling pressure on Seoul, it must have also exerted some pressure on Tokyo and urged the Abe administration to improve ties with Seoul. Therefore, some related response from Japan is likely to be seen in the near future. For example, at the two leaders&#8217; meeting in late December, it is possible that Japan might agree to relax semiconductor raw materials export restrictions on South Korea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renewal of GSOMIA has reduced tensions between the two countries but since the wartime forced labor issue lies at the root of their differences, bilateral ties cannot improve significantly now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nationalist sentiments in both Japan and South Korea are rising. Abe and Moon need to break the public&#8217;s mind-set &#8211; according to which concession means weakness &#8211; and consider their overall interests. They also have to constantly publicize future-oriented diplomatic values to their people, which is a responsibility of politicians.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the two countries can cherish this opportunity and handle issues through dialogue and consultation, thus ending the dilemma and contributing to regional peace and development.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</p>
<p>US Defense Secretary Mark Esper visited South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam during his recent trip to Asia from November 13 to 21. As Esper sought to strengthen US relations with these countries, he also tried to drive a wedge between China and its regional neighbors.</p>
<p>Vietnam was Esper&#8217;s last stop during the tour. Recently, Vietnam has taken a tough stance toward China on the South China Sea row. The country canceled Chinese action superstar Jackie Chan&#8217;s planned visit to Vietnam on November 10 following the actor&#8217;s public support for China&#8217;s historic justification of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vietnam has been conducting unilateral oil and gas drilling in China&#8217;s Wan&#8217;an Tan waters since May, which infringes on Chinese rights and interests. In this context, Esper&#8217;s visit may draw the US and Vietnam somewhat closer and increase the Southeast Asian country&#8217;s distance with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the US and Vietnam are only using each other. Vietnam should be aware of these facts: First, China and Vietnam have common interests in maintaining socialism, while promoting &#8220;peaceful evolution&#8221; of socialist countries to capitalist ones has been a constant US policy; Second, although China and Vietnam have intense disputes over sovereignty issues, the two countries understand the importance of peaceful resolution. Since it is unlikely that an armed conflict will break out between China and Vietnam, the US only plays a limited role in stirring up trouble between the two neighbors. Hence, Esper&#8217;s visit to Vietnam would not create a huge impact on the latter&#8217;s relations with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Esper has also been trying to drive a wedge between China and other Asian countries. During the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a>-US ministerial meeting of the annual ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus on November 17, Esper warned bloc members not to allow the guidelines of the Code of Conduct (COC) for the South China Sea &#8220;to be manipulated&#8221; by China. In the Philippines, Esper said that the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty applies to the South China Sea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington aims to obstruct the signing of the COC. Yet countries in the South China Sea, especially Vietnam and the Philippines, are clear about their interests. Neither Vietnamese President Nguyen Phu Trong nor Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte would blindly follow US orders. They are vigilant toward the US. However, the two leaders may still try to use the US to contain China.</p>
<p>Randall Schriver, US assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said before Esper&#8217;s trip that the number of countries that join the US in presence operation, joint patrols in the South China Sea and &#8220;transits through the Taiwan Strait&#8221; is &#8220;on the rise.&#8221; Although some countries are willing to cooperate with the US, such as in military exchanges, most of them with stakes in the South China Sea issue do not want to take sides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A minority of these countries might join hands with the US to oppose China. If they politically cooperate with Washington, Beijing will retaliate politically; if they unite in military terms, China will counteract in military terms. Although the US may give these countries some political, diplomatic and military incentives, it is impossible that the US will act as a protective shield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facing US provocation, China should keep maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea together with countries in the region, especially seeking to speed up COC negotiations. If the US and some other countries directly provoke China, China must take necessary or reciprocal measures to increase the cost of opposing China. Beijing should also make it rewarding for regional countries which cooperate with China, which could help them act more rationally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Korea&#8217;s diplomatic headache seemingly never goes away. As its clash with Japan shows no sign of a quick end, its dispute with the US over cost-sharing for US Forces Korea (USFK) has once again flared up, putting their alliance to a stress test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The military cost-sharing dispute between Washington and Seoul has been around for a while. When US President Donald Trump campaigned for the presidential election in 2016, he repeatedly bashed Seoul for not spending enough on the upkeep of USFK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the five-year cost-sharing agreement signed in 2014 was to expire in December 2019, the US government upped the pressure on South Korea to steeply increase the latter&#8217;s financial contribution. Trump even threatened to withdraw the USFK. Last year&#8217;s intensive negotiations between Washington and Seoul resulted in a compromise, in which South Korea agreed to a modest 8.2 percent increase in its financial contribution whereas the US gained a one-year rather than five-year agreement so that it could make a fresh demand every year.&nbsp;</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-11-20/36ae260b-6511-4934-b729-747d5f85e934.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A South Korean veteran shouts at a rally to denounce the US demand to raise the defense costs for stationing American troops in South Korea, near the US embassy in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday. US and South Korean officials on Tuesday publicly acknowledged the allies remain far apart in negotiations for increasing South Korea&#8217;s contributions to the costs for maintaining the American military presence on its soil. Photo: AP </p>
<p>This year, the Trump administration threw a jaw-dropping demand to the negotiating table by seeking to hike South Korea&#8217;s contribution to a staggering $5 billion, an about fivefold increase from the number in previous year. According to the new proposal, South Korea not only needs to pay for what it used to pay such as South Korean employees who work for the USFK, the construction cost for military facilities and military support costs, it will also need to partially foot the bill with regard to the USFK&#8217;s rotational deployment expenses, joint military exercises and even pay for US civilian employees and their family members. Such an unconventional and unilateral demand not only put a substantial financial onus on South Korea, which is struggling with a sagging economy, but also dealt a psychological blow to South Koreans, who see the demand as blackmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requested sum is exorbitant. The tactic adopted by the Trump administration is also quite impressive. In order to pressure South Korea to make a huge concession, Trump sharpened his rhetoric, accusing Seoul of ingratitude and defining South Korea as a rich country, which should pay more for any joint defense activity. In order to show Washington&#8217;s disappointment, US negotiators broke off talks with South Korea on Tuesday November 19 and abruptly left. Reuters reported Thursday that &#8220;US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said earlier he was not aware of any plans to withdraw troops from South Korea if cost-sharing talks failed.&#8221; Some analysts still believe that Trump may do so if the ongoing negotiations do not go as he wishes.</p>
<p>The timing to up the pressure on South Korea was carefully calculated. First, South Korean President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1046164.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Jae-in</a>&#8216;s approval rate slid to a dangerous low and his country&#8217;s relations with some major players in Northeast Asia are already in a bad shape. Seoul became embroiled in arguments with Tokyo over a variety of issues;<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>n leader<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//daily-specials/Where-is-Kim-Jong-un/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-un</a> repeatedly snubbed Moon&#8217;s olive branch; China and South Korea still live in the shadow of their dispute over Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1012594.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THAAD</a>) deployment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, Trump administration knows that other US allies are closely watching when it fights an uphill battle on its demand from Seoul. The Trump administration makes no secret of its intention to squeeze other allies for more military financial contribution. Many member states of NATO were constantly reminded for failing to honor their commitment to the 2 percent goal &#8211; dedicate 2 percent of their national economic output on defense every year. Japan was also reportedly asked for a 300 percent increase &#8211; from $2 billion to $8 billion &#8211; in yearly payment for US troops in Japan. Therefore, if the Trump administration succeeds in the first major battle with South Korea, other allies may have to follow suit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, to score the first victory is not easy. More Koreans believe that the USFK not only provides protection to South Korea, but also serves US national security interests in the Asia-Pacific region. It is unfair for South Korea to shoulder the heavy financial burden for stationing US troops on the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the South Korean government also puts a procedural obstacle in the way of negotiations by insisting that the US government seeks a revision of the current Special Measures Agreement if it wants South Korea to cover additional costs. More importantly, the Moon administration cannot ignore the strong anti-US sentiment in South Korea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yonhap News Agency reported on November 16 that &#8220;96 percent of [South Korean] respondents in a recent survey opposed any sharp rise in Seoul&#8217;s share of the burden.&#8221; Protests against the US have erupted one after the other. It will be political suicide if the Moon administration accepts the US demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seemingly, the ongoing cost-sharing dispute between Washington and Seoul is all about money. It reveals Trump&#8217;s deep-seated resentment against South Korea as the latter always failed to respond to his call, such as sending its naval ships to the Persian Gulf to join the US-led maritime patrol there or taking a stand in the US-China trade war or agreeing to future deployment of US intermediate-range missiles in South Korean territory. Trump moaned in September that in many cases, South Korea does not do much for the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, no matter how difficult the cost-sharing negotiations are, both the US and South Korea will seek a quick solution as time runs out. Moreover, both countries cannot afford to break the alliance. If Seoul cannot satisfy the monetary demand, it may be forced to do something else, like expanding its alliance with Washington beyond the Korean Peninsula.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</p>
<p>The Wan&#8217;an Tan in the Nansha Islands, claimed by Vietnam as &#8220;Vanguard Bank,&#8221; has witnessed a protracted standoff between China and Vietnam this year. Against the backdrop, Vietnam has been hoping powers outside the region, including the US and Japan, could endorse it.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade Tran Tuan Anh paid visits to Japan and the US in September and October in an attempt to encourage more energy enterprises to cooperate with Vietnam in offshore energy exploration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On September 30, US Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Francis R. Fannon and Dang Hoang An, then Vietnamese vice minister of industry and trade, signed in Washington a memorandum of understanding (MOU) memorializing a US-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership on Energy. Over a month later, an MOU to implement the Son My 2 combined cycle gas turbine power plant in Vietnam was signed by US-based ASE Corporation and representatives of the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade on November 8. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and US Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel Kritenbrink attended the signing ceremony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington has ulterior motives in improving energy cooperation with Hanoi at such a rapid pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the US intends to further deepen and implement its Indo-Pacific Strategy, and Vietnam is an anchor to achieve it. On November 4, Vietnam officially took over<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a>&#8216;s annually rotating chairmanship from Thailand and has thus increased its utility for the US.</p>
<p>Second, US President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration has been paying increasing attention to the South China Sea issue. After ties between China and the Philippines improved, Vietnam has provided an important leverage the US can rest on to contain China. The scramble over offshore oil and gas between Beijing and Hanoi has been a unique anchor for Washington. Some hawks in the Trump administration have repeatedly tried to sow discord between China and Vietnam, especially instigating Vietnam to provoke China at sea. This can turn the two countries into enemies, which the US can benefit from.</p>
<p>Third, Washington is aware that Hanoi&#8217;s oil and gas exploration and production are on the decline. If the US can help Vietnam combat its power shortage, the Asian country will be obliged to Washington, obey its command and become its important pawn in the Indo-Pacific Strategy.</p>
<p>The core strategic intention of the US is to use joint energy development with Vietnam as a cover to instigate Hanoi to take bigger steps in maritime confrontation with China.</p>
<p>Hanoi also has its own calculations in cooperating with Washington.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, Vietnam hopes to multiply its strategic value. It is clearly aware of its values for the Trump administration under the current geopolitical environment. As an anchor in Indo-Pacific Strategy, Hanoi can attract Washington&#8217;s attention for bigger gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, Hanoi wants to cooperate with Washington and Tokyo to upset Beijing, because Vietnam tends to believe Washington and Tokyo could make China feel the fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, amid the tensions with China at Wan&#8217;an Tan, inking deals with Japan and the US for resource exploration can help Vietnam tie up with major powers outside the region, so as to effectively make China aware of the difficulties of tensions with Vietnam.</p>
<p>However, this amounts to lack of proper judgment. Addressing a grand gathering to celebrate the People&#8217;s Liberation Army&#8217;s 90th anniversary in 2017, President Xi Jinping said, &#8220;No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is harmful to our sovereignty, security or development interests.&#8221; China is willing to negotiate for joint projects with other countries but will not tolerate any harm to its sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington and Hanoi&#8217;s intentions are widely clear: The US needs a helper in the region and its purpose is to bolster Vietnam to stand up to China at sea; Vietnam looks to the US in an attempt to make Washington endorse it while making huge economic gains.</p>

<p>With US Defense Secretary Mark Esper&#8217;s Sunday declaration of indefinitely postponing a military exercise with South Korea, the chances of tensions reemerging on the troubled<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a> seem to have been nipped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suspension of the war games announced during the Pentagon chief&#8217;s South Korea visit, however, does not mitigate the complexity of the fraught situation on the Korean Peninsula.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For quite some time in the future, the peninsula&#8217;s security will remain in an intense flux. Hostility is deeply rooted between the two Koreas due to foreign military presence on the peninsula and Pyongyang&#8217;s alleged possession of nuclear weapons. In addition, US deployment of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea and the US-led alliance&#8217;s efforts to dominate the security framework on the Korean Peninsula have led Northeast Asia into a lasting game between big powers inside and outside the region. Although the international community and stakeholders have expressed willingness to settle divergences, the major causes of tensions have not been removed and keep popping up.</p>
<p>The US has been strengthening its military presence on the Korean Peninsula and frequently conducting small-scale drills with South Korea, leading to continuous strains in the region. Moreover, Washington treats the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue as geopolitical competition among major powers and regards the issue part of its strategy to contain Beijing and Moscow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such being the case, negotiations on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue have made no progress in the past two years as no party directly involved would change their approaches. Though the future is not that optimistic, negotiations need to continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington hasn&#8217;t jettisoned hostility against Pyongyang. The key reason peace has still not been achieved on the Korean Peninsula is that after the end of the Cold War, the US, a country outside the region, has been inciting disputes on the peninsula to enhance the role of its alliances with South Korea and Japan in regional security affairs. Washington won&#8217;t stop playing up Pyongyang&#8217;s threat to stability on the peninsula so as to ensure its continuous presence in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past two years, every move by the US has been aimed at weakening<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>&#8216;s defense capability and hurting the country economically, with a regime change as the ultimate goal. The US has never regarded North Korea as a legitimate regime. This has prevented constructive efforts for the resolution of the standoff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suspension of a major drill by Washington and Seoul is a high-sounding move to take Pyongyang back to the negotiating table, but the frequent small drills have shown real hostile US policy toward North Korea.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump&#8217;s unprecedented handling of the situation has to some extent mitigated the tensions, but his innovative approach has been boycotted by mainstream political elites in his country.</p>
<p>The 2020 US presidential election is coming. Trump is definitely unwilling to see his efforts on resolving the Korean Peninsula crisis adversely affect his election. He is likely to seek another meeting with the North Korean leader in an attempt to make some diplomatic achievements that he can boast of to the electorate.</p>
<p>But US-North Korea relations, as well as US ties with other powers concerned with the Korean Peninsula issue, are deeply rooted in every country&#8217;s own national interest. Trump cannot change US elites&#8217; existing notion of North Korea policy, nor the US political culture with inherent hostility against the North Korean system. Even if Trump has already adjusted his North Korea policy, even if the US-South Korea large-scale military exercise has been postponed indefinitely, the so-called goodwill can hardly change the cruel reality &#8211; Washington&#8217;s hostile policy against Pyongyang is likely to remain, and the future of the Korean Peninsula will stay strained for a long time. It is hoped that such tension will not spin out of control.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Sunday that the US and South Korea have indefinitely postponed a joint military exercise in an &#8220;act of goodwill&#8221; toward<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>, according to media reports. Yet if Washington wants Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table, it needs to take further pragmatic steps.</p>
<p>In an April speech, North Korean leader<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//daily-specials/Where-is-Kim-Jong-un/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-un</a> said he would &#8220;wait with patience until the end of the year for the US to come up with a courageous decision.&#8221; As the deadline approaches, if the US does not suspend its military drills with South Korea, or take cordial measures in other domains, the situation on the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a> could worsen again. In that case, countries in the region may doubt US sincerity to resolve the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, lose faith in Washington and tend to explore a new path to deal with the crisis in this regard.</p>
<p>China proposed &#8220;double suspension&#8221; to help the US and North Korea break out of the security dilemma and return to the negotiating table. &#8220;Double suspension&#8221; refers to cessation in North Korean nuclear and missile activity in exchange for suspension of large-scale US-South Korea war games. Pyongyang regards the military exercises Washington and Seoul conducted jointly as hostile. Esper&#8217;s decision can thus be seen as a response to North Korea&#8217;s concern.</p>
<p>For South Korea, launching military drills is expensive. The US is seeking up to $5 billion annually from South Korea as defense expenditure, &#8220;more than five times the 1.04 trillion won ($890.54 million) South Korea agreed to pay this year,&#8221; said Reuters. It also reported that South Korean progressive groups protested on Monday against &#8220;highway robbery&#8221; by &#8220;greedy&#8221; Americans. Esper&#8217;s decision may help calm the protesters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim Kye-gwan, advisor to the foreign ministry of North Korea, said on Monday that North Korea is not interested in &#8220;talks that have no benefit for us&#8221; and giving US President Donald Trump anything to brag about as Pyongyang has received nothing in return, in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.</p>
<p>Kim sounds reasonable in making this statement. In spite of interactions with the US at Singapore and Hanoi summits, and at Panmunjom, Pyongyang&#8217;s distrust for Washington has not abated. North Korea believes that with one year left for the 2020 US presidential election, Washington is just paying lip service to Pyongyang to stop the latter from engaging in nuclear and missiles activities, so that Trump has another achievement to showcase in front of the US voters. But Washington fails to realize that Pyongyang sees no practical meaning in any such talk.</p>
<p>North Korea has appealed to ensure the security of its political system and abolition of hostile US policies. In terms of guaranteeing its system security, it hopes Washington will suspend the massive military exercises with Seoul, formally turn the Korean Armistice Agreement into a peace treaty. Moreover, North Korea wants to establish normal diplomatic relations with the US.</p>
<p>China believes that the UN Security Council needs to consider invoking, in due course, reversible provisions to encourage North Korea and other relevant parties to make bigger strides toward denuclearization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past two years, North Korea has not conducted massive nuclear or missile tests. The country also dismantled its Yongbyon nuclear facility. Therefore, North Korea hopes the US and UN could discuss about reversible provisions of their sanctions and lift some of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these appeals cannot be accepted, the prospects of future Washington-Pyongyang talks are bleak. If the US wants to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table, lip service is meaningless. More concrete steps are needed. Otherwise, North Korea will regard any US move as perfunctory. Pyongyang may have hoped to send messages to Washington by recent super-large multiple rocket launcher tests: If the US returns to the &#8220;strategic patience&#8221; policy of former US president Barack Obama on North Korea, Pyongyang will not rule out the possibility of carrying out more missile and nuclear tests. North Korea intends to pressure Washington so as to jointly solve the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Without properly resolving the nuclear issue, it will be difficult for North Korea to achieve progress in other realms, including economic development.</p>
<p>The US has not yet dropped its hostile policies because of its distrust for North Korea. Washington thinks Pyongyang&#8217;s denuclearization is &#8220;reversible.&#8221; Therefore, the US is reluctant to lift sanctions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, to tackle the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, both sides have to make more compromises to achieve mutual trust.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Sri Lanka&#8217;s new President Gotabaya Rajapaksa speaks during his first address to the nation in Anuradhapura of North Central Province, Sri Lanka, on Monday. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s former defense chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sworn in as the country&#8217;s new president on Monday, after he won the weekend election. Since Rajapaksa is widely perceived to be &#8220;pro-China,&#8221; his inauguration is considered the beginning of Sri Lanka&#8217;s tilt toward the world&#8217;s second largest economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and Sri Lanka share a traditional friendship. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386-589), Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist monk who brought a large number of Buddhist books back to China after his foreign trip, had lived in Sri Lanka for a long time on his way back and became an important figure in the history of Sri Lankan Buddhism. In renowned Chinese navigator Zheng He&#8217;s voyage during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Zheng landed in Sri Lanka several times. At that time, Sri Lanka had also sent officials to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1952, before China and Sri Lanka established diplomatic ties, when China was under sanctions from the West and Sri Lanka was facing a foreign exchange crisis, the two countries inked the Rubber-Rice Pact agreement, in which China agreed to provide rice in exchange for Sri Lankan rubber. The deal resolved the urgency in both countries, and showed the two as reliable partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After former Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena assumed office on January 9, 2015, China-Sri Lanka ties had gone through twists and turns with some major cooperation projects being put on hold. There are three major reasons. First, opposition stems from the nature of electoral politics. Second, the pressure and temptation from the international community made Sirisena think he could use relations with China to trade for more assistance from other countries. Third, given the contradictions between different interest groups within the country, only change can lead to opportunities for a new government to make gains. Yet eventually, Sri Lanka failed to obtain more assistance from other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, China-Sri Lanka relations are deeply rooted in the public opinion in the island country. Quite a few important infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka have been built by China, including Hambantota Port, Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Norochcholai Power Station and Colombo International Financial City. These achievements cannot be undone by government changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Rajapaksa has started his term in office, there will be more opportunities for China and Sri Lanka to develop relations. In September, Rajapaksa&#8217;s adviser Palitha Kohona said, &#8220;When Gotabaya Rajapaksa becomes the president&#8230; he will set the record right&#8221; and restore the relationship with China to where it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, not everyone is pleased to see China and Sri Lanka develop closer ties. Some are worried that the island country would greatly depend on China economically, politically and militarily, which would boost China&#8217;s influence on Sri Lanka, thus affecting the power structure around the Indian Ocean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a country&#8217;s goal is to obtain strategic monopoly in South Asia and North Indian Ocean, any other nation&#8217;s rapid development or cooperation with major powers outside the region can be considered a threat. But if a country&#8217;s major goal is regional peace and development, it would welcome China&#8217;s investment and collaboration with countries in the region. It is believed Rajapaksa will draft his foreign policy based on his understanding of Sri Lanka&#8217;s interests. Fundamentally speaking, Rajapaksa is not &#8220;pro-China,&#8221; but pro-Sri Lanka.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s foreign policy is determined by its domestic conditions. It is an island country in the Indian Ocean and separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Palk Strait. Its location has given Sri Lanka more strategic freedom than other South Asian countries to determine its own diplomacy independently. Although Sri Lanka is not a developed country, its economic statistics are better than most other South Asian economies. Its populations have every reason to pursue higher economic goals. The country sits in the Indian Ocean along one of the world&#8217;s busiest shipping lanes, which is supposed to bring Sri Lanka enormous wealth. However, given its poor infrastructure, it has been hard for the country to benefit from the transportation route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooperation with China mirrors Sri Lanka&#8217;s wish to use its geographical advantage and to turn itself into a transport hub in the North Indian Ocean. However, Colombo&#8217;s ambition has made other major regional powers uneasy. They have the right to be concerned. But Sri Lanka also has the right to make policies that are in line with its own interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, it is not doctrines that are dominating Latin American politics, but globalization. If we still use neoliberalism or any other concept invented by Western scholars to explain what Latin America is passing through, our understanding of the continent may not be right. We can only understand the problems of Latin American countries by observing them in an already globalized world, especially comparing them with Asian countries.</p>
<p>The fact is simple to understand: Globalization has increased the flow of goods and formed a complete industrial chain. A country will gradually retreat to the bottom of the global industrial chain if the length of its railways begins to decrease, factories start to close, consumer goods start to depend on import, manufacturing jobs are reduced and no one in the country is willing or able to become blue-collar workers. The country will become more vulnerable as it has to export raw materials to sustain its economy. Thus, it will be the first to become a victim of global recession.</p>
<p>According to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, China, Japan, South Korea, India, plus some Southeast Asian economies account for over 50 percent of total global manufacturing output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, of all Latin American countries, only Mexico and Brazil have relatively stronger manufacturing industries. But they respectively account for only 2 percent and 1 percent of global manufacturing output.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, Argentina&#8217;s manufacturing (value added) as a percentage of GDP fell from more than 40 percent in 1965 to less than 13 percent in 2018. Another turbulent country, Chile, fell from nearly 30 percent in the mid-1970s to 11 percent in 2018. The entire Latin American manufacturing industry is still shrinking.</p>
<p>When we lived in a period in which countries and regions were relatively independent, Brazil, Argentina and Chile were leading producers in the region, and could hence win more export orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as globalization accelerates, the competitiveness of Europe and the US continues to increase on the high-end, and the rise of East Asian countries on the middle and low ends also has a strong impact. With expanding globalization, as global industries are forged into a complete industrial chain, Brazil, Argentina and Chile will be replaced.</p>
<p>Globalization to date is more about alternatives. With capital, cheaper alternatives can always be found. The fierce inter-state competition results in winners replacing losers, who find it hard to get back to their position from where they have been derailed. So far, there have been no successful cases of deindustrialization followed by reindustrialization. US President Donald Trump is trying to achieve it, with grim prospects.</p>
<p>Reliance on exporting industrial and consumer goods and equipment has led to a profound change in the economic structure of Latin American countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mass labor forces have entered low-end businesses, and the possibility to transform into high-end manufacturing has declined. Latin American left-wing forces were prosperous when Asian manufacturing industry represented by China boomed.</p>
<p>The Left is known to offer more benefits to low-income people. Of course, this is not a question of what kind of doctrines, or whether left-wing or right-wing, should govern. Increasing social investment has been a common policy in Latin American countries since 2010. However, due to globalization, Latin American countries can access better and cheaper industrial and consumer products compared to those produced at home, which leads these nations to depend more on exporting energy and primary products in exchange of economic growth, and maintaining their European-style welfare system.</p>
<p>Amid the backdrop of a global economic downturn, especially Asian economic slowdown, they would be hit hard. A generous welfare system cannot sustain without the support of manufacturing. Rising unemployment could lead to social unrest &#8211; which is ravaging many Latin American countries that are now in the throes of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is difficult for an economy without factories to be sustainable. For developing countries, deindustrialization is also a source of instability. This has been a problem of unbalanced development brought about by globalization.</p>
