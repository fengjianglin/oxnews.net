<p>One of the world&#8217;s best-selling detective novelists, Jack Reacher creator Lee Child, has said he is becoming Irish so he can continue to travel within the European Union after<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a>.</p>
<p>The British author, whose real name is James Grant, said he was in the process of applying for a passport as his father was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got the passport yet but I will do very soon, it feels like I&#8217;m cheating to be honest as I will get in the back door,&#8221; he was quoted as saying in the Irish Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a huge fan of Britain even though I was born there,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It&#8217;s a silly and frustrating country, which is why I moved to America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Child, who was born in England, was speaking in Berlin on a four-city European tour with other British writers.</p>
<p>They are speaking out against Britain&#8217;s departure from the EU, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants before January 31.</p>
<p>The author said Johnson, who went to the prestigious Eton College and Oxford University, was the product of privilege and an elitist system.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he had gone to my school, he would not now be prime minister,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The British literature heavyweight, who sells one of his crime books every 13 seconds, was honored by Queen Elizabeth II in June.</p>
