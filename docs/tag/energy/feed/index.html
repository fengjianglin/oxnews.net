<p>Scientists in the US have claimed a technological breakthrough that could resolve one of the key concerns surrounding all-electric vehicles: 10 minutes charging time to add 200 miles of driving range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing in the journal Joule, researchers at The Pennsylvania State University said that such a speedy charge rate required a battery to rapidly take in 400 kilowatts of energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current generation vehicles are not capable of this feat as it risks the lithium plating, the formation of metallic lithium around the anode, which would severely deteriorate battery life.</p>
<p>To get around this constraint, the researchers raised the temperature of their experimental battery to 60 C during the charge cycle, then lowered it back down as it was used.</p>
<p>What this does is &#8220;limit the battery&#8217;s exposure to the elevated charge temperature, thus generating a very long cycle life,&#8221; said senior author Chao-Yang Wang, a mechanical engineer at The Pennsylvania State University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scaling up the design and bringing it to market may take a decade, Rick Sachleben, a member of the American Chemical Society said.</p>
<p>Makers will need to make sure that rapidly raising the temperature is safe and stable, and doesn&#8217;t lead to explosions given the phenomenal amount of energy that is being transferred.</p>

<p>Scientists from Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU) have improved the alloying process (improving the properties of metal due to impurities), allowing not only the wear-resistance of materials to be increased, but also giving them some qualitatively new characteristics, which is in demand in high-tech industries, science and energy.</p>
<p>The results of the study have been published in &#8220;Surface and Coatings Technology&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to the TPU scientists, traditional alloying methods have exhausted their technological potential. In order to manufacture materials with improved properties, they increasingly resort to affecting metal with beams of charged particles, plasma flows, and laser radiation.</p>
<p>One such method is ion implantation (ion-implant doping); it allows you to change the elemental composition, microstructure and morphology of the surface layers of the material that determine such properties as wear-resistance, corrosion resistance, and others.</p>
<p>The Tomsk scientists have developed a new method of ion implantation, dramatically expanding the possibilities of using this method in the industry. According to head of research, head of the TPU high-intensity ion implantation laboratory Alexander Ryabchikov, experimentally they&#8217;ve managed to increase the wear-resistance of stainless steel more than a hundred times.</p>
<p>In addition, using this technology, one can create parts and products with specified specific surface properties. For example, during ion-implanting zirconium with titanium, a barrier layer is formed that prevents hydrogen penetration, which can be used to increase the lifespan and safety of operation of nuclear fuel cells.</p>
<p>Today, the use of ion implantation on an industrial scale is constrained by the low thickness of formed ion-doped layers. Solving this problem by increasing the kinetic energy of the ion flux requires the use of large accelerators, which is not economically feasible.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposed method of increasing the depth of ion penetration into a material is to enhance radiation-stimulated diffusion by very high-density ion beams, which are 2-3 times better than those used in traditional ion implantation&#8221;, Alexander Ryabchikov said.</p>
<p>The results obtained by the laboratory confirm the possibility of creating a doped surface layer with a depth of several hundred micrometres, while the results of other ion doping methods reach a depth only in the dozens and hundreds of nanometres.</p>
<p>The authors of the study believe that the development of the method for the high-intensity implantation of ions with low energy can revolutionise the technology of improving the properties of materials.</p>
<p>Further research in this direction will make it possible to reduce the cost of using this technology and improve the quality of products. The TPU scientists received a grant from the Russian Science Foundation for their work.</p>
<p>From 26 to 30 August 2019, the International Conference on Surface Modification of Materials by Ion Beams (SMMIB-2019) was held at Tomsk Polytechnic University with more than 150 delegates from 22 countries taking part. For the first time, the largest scientific event in its field was in Russia; the event brought together leading scientists from Germany, China, the USA, Japan, and France.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<p>Two third-generation nuclear reactors began generating power last week in China, with experts saying it signals that China&#8217;s nuclear power industry has overcome a number of technical difficulties.</p>
<p>The Taishan nuclear plant in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province using AP1000 technology and the Sanmen nuclear plant in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province installed with evolutionary power reactors (EPR), are now conducting test runs and other experiments to confirm the reactors&#8217; safety before going fully online and adding power to the country&#8217;s grid, the news website thepaper.cn reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Although the two reactors had been hit by delays, China has learned lessons from the construction process and now has a reference to build additional nuclear power plants, which will accelerate the industry&#8217;s development in the country, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the most advanced reactors in the world, Taishan No.1 and Sanmen No.1 reactors are highly secure with optimized installation. Even hit by natural hazards such as an earthquake, they face a very small chance of being damaged,&#8221; Lin said.</p>
<p>As of the first quarter in 2018, there were 38 nuclear power units in operation in the Chinese mainland with a combined installed capacity of 36.93 million kilowatts, according to data from the Chinese Nuclear Energy Association, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
<p>Nuclear plants can provide air pollution-free energy at a lower cost to consumers, Lin said, noting they meet China&#8217;s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Although facing strong competition from other clean energy sources such as wind and solar power, nuclear energy could see cost advantages if future plants can be constructed at a lower cost, Lin added.</p>
<p>The security and safety of nuclear power has long been a concern for countries operating such plants especially after the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, which forced 300,000 people to evacuate the region.</p>
<p>China ended its moratorium on the approval of nuclear power plants in June 2015, and approved the construction of eight nuclear power plants that year.</p>
<p>In 2016, no new plants were approved. In 2017 only one nuclear plant began construction at East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, thepaper.cn reported.</p>
<p>Five reactors are expected to be completed this year, including those at Taishan and Sanmen, with a combined installed capacity of six million kilowatts. Six to eight new reactors are expected to be approved this year, according to thepaper.cn.</p>

<p>China has developed a system that could ensure nuclear-reactor safety during crisis without using electricity.</p>
<p>With China&#8217;s updated version of the third-generation nuclear technology, the CAP1400 nuclear reactors in East China&#8217;s Shandong Province have recently passed all six major technological tests including the ones involving the passive safety system, the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/5.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Science and Technology</a> reported on June 6. </p>
<p>&#8220;Passive safety systems, unlike active safety systems, can work without electrical support and prevent the reactor from releasing radioactive material into the surrounding environment when an accident happens,&#8221; Gui Liming, an expert on nuclear safety systems at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The CAP1400 adopted three defense lines for safety in its passive safety system, which&nbsp; takes effect in case of an accident, reducing the temperature and pressure in an overheating reactor and containing radioactive waste to the hilt inside the reactor containment, Science and Technology Daily reported. </p>
<p>For example, a chilled-water reservoir is equipped right on top of the reactor, which &#8220;can be used for constant cooling of the reactor for 72 hours,&#8221; Gui said. The water will drop under the force of gravity instead of being pumped inside by electricity as in second generation nuclear reactors, Gui added. </p>
<p>The second-generation nuclear technology, though highly efficient, &#8220;has the fatal weakness that electricity is a must to activate the protection system, while the CAP1400 theoretically enables the reactor to be safe under any circumstances,&#8221; said Zhang Luqing, a retired expert from China National Nuclear Corporation.</p>
<p>On March 11, 2011, following a major earthquake in the Pacific Ocean, a 15-meter tsunami disabled the power supply and cooling system of three Fukushima Daiichi reactors in Japan, causing a nuclear disaster where all three cores largely melted within the first three days, the World Nuclear Association reported. </p>
<p>The conception of China&#8217;s CAP1400 is &#8220;very important for the future of nuclear energy,&#8221; said Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), during IAEA&#8217;s annual General Conference in 2017, the Xinhua News Agency reported. </p>
<p>&#8220;The CAP1400 reactor has a power of 1,400 to 1,500 megawatts, a rate thought impossible by US companies for passive safety systems,&#8221; Wang Yinan, a researcher with the Development Research Center of the State Council, told the Global Times on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The CAP1400 is an enlarged version of the AP1000, which was developed based on modified technology of the US nuclear firm Westinghouse Electric Co, increasing the net power from 1,250 megawatts to 1,400 megawatts, Zhang said.</p>
<p>China had 35 nuclear reactors in commercial operation as of the end of 2016, Xinhua&nbsp; reported.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s first remote-island intelligent microgrid officially went into operation on Yongxing Island in the South China Sea on Sunday in a move that Chinese experts hailed as beneficial to regional civil and military development.</p>
<p>The small power grid increases the island&#8217;s power supply eightfold and can operate independently or in conjunction with Hainan Province&#8217;s main electrical grid to satisfy civilian and military demand for electricity. </p>
<p>The first microgrid can later be developed into a microgrid control center that manages other microgrid networks on other remote islands in the South China Sea. </p>
<p>&#8220;The establishment of the microgrid demonstrates China&#8217;s capability in civilian public services and will help prompt the development of the South China Sea,&#8221; Chen Xiangmiao, a research fellow at the Hainan-based National Institute for the South China Sea, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>Electricity on the island is generated from sources including diesel and photovoltaic energy, China Central Television (CCTV) reported.</p>
<p>The hybrid power generation can better meet increasing civil electricity demand for medical services, emergency rescue, logistics, airport operation and tourism development, Chen said.</p>
<p>The microgrid also aids military personnel and weaponry, analysts said. </p>
<p>Stable electricity underwrites military stations and daily military operations in the South China Sea. Surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles, for example, need not depend solely on electric vehicles, said Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator. </p>
<p>The service life of weaponry can be extended by reducing their reliance on self-contained chargers, Song told the Global Times on Monday. </p>
<p>Stable electricity was also critical at armories and arms depots for handling the high temperatures, humidity and salinity of the islands, Song noted.</p>
<p>Yongxing Island &#8211; the largest of the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea &#8211; depended on smaller generators and the system was sometimes overloaded and fried fishermen&#8217;s refrigerator circuits, Sansha power supply bureau chief Wu Yu told CCTV. </p>
<p>But now the electrical reliability of the island can be controlled by Hainan&#8217;s network control center in Haikou through fiber-optic submarine cables, Wu said. </p>
<p>Data grasped by the microgrid can be shared with other scientific research departments or projects launched in the South China Sea, Chen noted.</p>
<p>The grid host machine on Yongxing Island can collect and monitor load data from diesel generators, the photovoltaic system and seawater desalination as well as charging piles, China News Service reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;The microgrid on Yongxing Island is only the start,&#8221; Fu Yongfeng, deputy head of Hainan power grid branch under China Southern Power Grid, told CCTV. &#8220;We&#8217;ll copy the model on the other islands.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime, we will explore wave-powered electricity and refrigeration techniques by usage of residual heat.&#8221;</p>
