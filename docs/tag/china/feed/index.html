<p>Eschewing the traditional romantic seaside or flowery background, a couple in Central China took their wedding photos in the middle of zebra crossing of a busy intersection before being chased away by the traffic police.</p>
<p>A traffic surveillance video posted by Knews on Sina Weibo shows several staff of the photography company in Hubei Province laying out a red blanket in the left turn lane of the busy intersection, completely ignoring passing and oncoming traffic and pedestrians.</p>
<p>The bride in her white wedding dress and the groom in his black suit walk into the flow of traffic as the photographer snaps their photo. They even pose sitting and lying on a blanket in the middle of the road. A number of pedestrians were confused by the scene and passing cars had to slow down to avoid hitting them and each other.</p>
<p>After being alerted to the near mayhem by passers-by, traffic police finally shooed the couple away. The report did not mention if the couple and photographer were fined for their actions.</p>

<p>Wang Zhenxi is an extremely busy support therapist who says she counsels more than 800 mistresses a year and even helps them find true, monogamous love.</p>
<p>Wang says she uses four mobile phones to take calls from women seeking her help. &#8220;I meet clients 330 days a year,&#8221; said Wang in a seven-minute video posted by the Zhengzhou Evening News that features a lot of tears.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken Wang says she first befriends her clients who include brokenhearted mistresses and angry spouses whose partners have cheated on them. She will even introduce her clients to new lovers and help them start a new life.</p>
<p>In the video, Wang is seen paying a visit to a 27-year-old woman who had been in a relationship with a man 15 years her senior. She had just had an abortion and her paramour had disappeared from her life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know he was married and has a child until his wife came looking for me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when I decided to break up with him but he got down on his knees and begged me not to leave him, saying that he didn&#8217;t love his wife. I&#8217;m softhearted and ended up staying with him,&#8221; said the woman through teas</p>
<p>Wang has introduced the woman to a man who has promised to marry her and the couple are seen sitting together holding hands.</p>
<p>Many Chinese netizens consider this profession as necessary and beneficial.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good job, which can help not only a family but also mistresses who don&#8217;t find a correct way,&#8221; one of Sina Weibo users commented.</p>

<p>A series of unfortunate and uncomfortable events involving a woman&#8217;s entry and exit points for food resulted in her getting 12,000 yuan ($1,703) in compensation from her dentist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The woman in Northeast China said she had botched dental surgery which caused her extreme case of hemorrhoids, for which she had surgery four years ago, to once again rear their ugly head &#8211; so to speak.</p>
<p>The woman surnamed Chen said her first treatment at a dentist in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, only exacerbated problems with her teeth.</p>
<p>Chen told Knews her dentist damaged her gums during her first visit and had to have additional surgery to replace a tooth. During that visit the replacement tooth popped loose and she swallowed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a panic, Chen took a powerful laxative that was utterly effective over the next four days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I needed to go to toilet seven or eight times a day, which led to my hemorrhoid returning,&#8221; Chen said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The series of blunders by the dentist enraged Chen and she demanded compensation but is still not satisfied with the 12,000 yuan payout she received.</p>
<p>Chen&#8217;s tooth was finally repaired at another dental clinic, according to the report of Knews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually swallowing a broken tooth is no big deal, it will reappear at the other end in a few days,&#8221;a netizen wrote.</p>

<p>A resident in East China paid overdue property management fees with 45,000 coins, which took six people four hours to count.</p>
<p>The resident, surnamed Liu, in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province was unhappy with his property management company and had refused to pay the required fees for three years and owed 49,661 yuan ($7,067), according to a video posted by Knews. The video said Liu collected all the pocket change his daughter had saved for over 20 years, and dumped 45,000 one-yuan coins on the company, making a huge pile that appears to be more than a meter in diameter. The pile weighed more than 300 kilograms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The property company earlier this year had sued Liu who was ordered by a court to pay all the arrears. A staff member of the company told Knews that six of her colleagues spent more than four hours counting all the coins and wrapping them in proper rolls. &#8220;It&#8217;s so difficult to correctly count so many coins,&#8221; the staff member said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The insects are fried into a dish. Photo: screenshot of video posted by the Pear Video</p>
<p>Several women from the village of Leshan, Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province are adding to the repertoire of exotic eatable insects, which appear to have been previously shunned because they stink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A video posted by the Pear Video shows the women overturning river rocks and collecting what appears to be a variety of beetle that are literally called stink bugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The women appear to have developed their own technique for handling the stink bugs that includes soaking them in water before frying them in oil. The women say that while the bugs are high in protein they still don&#8217;t have anywhere near a pleasant aroma, but are delectable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bugs just smell bad but taste very delicious, they can also treat rheumatic diseases,&#8221; said one of the women without citing any medical studies.</p>
<p>Stink bugs are an invasive species that are most plentiful in the fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can fetch a high price, about 300 yuan ($42) a kilogram,&#8221; another village told Pear Video as she turned over rocks and picked up one of the bugs. The video shows the woman allowing a dozen of the collected bugs crawl over her hand.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Sunday night. Photo: screenshot of video posted by the Global Times</p>
<p>Hong Kong police attempted to appeal to the sentimentality of the final rioters, who held up in Hong Kong Polytechnic University, by playing love songs over the PA system, which has inspired Chinese netizens to come up with their own playlist to serenade the rioters.</p>
<p>The police have been broadcasting popular songs including &#8220;Green Island Serenade,&#8221; the theme song of the Hong Kong movie Prison on Fire, and &#8220;Ambush from All Sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lyrics include such sentimental lines as &#8220;We could almost meet each other. What a pity we brushed past again. Hiding everywhere to wait for you, I felt lonelier than ever.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese netizens loved the creative thinking of Hong Kong police and developed a playlist of 15 songs including &#8220;Do you know I am waiting for you&#8221; and even the tearjerker &#8220;Last<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The playlist is titled &#8220;Hong Kong Polytechnic University Music Festival&#8221; by Hong Kong police.&nbsp; The songs on the list have been played more than 90,000 times and downloaded by more than 7,000 netizens, according to the Beijing Daily.</p>
