<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong></p>
<p>This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC). The<br />
<em>Global Times</em> interviewed 14 foreign consuls general in Shanghai about their understanding of China&#8217;s development, and in their opinion what are the most impressive changes that China has gone through during the past 70 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deny Wachyudi Kurnia</p>
<p>Consul General of Indonesia in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>China&#8217;s development during the past 70 years has been amazing. We see how China has developed into this modern China today, making itself the biggest exporter as well as one of the largest countries in the world in terms of GDP and purchasing capacity.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s internationalization is also taking place. There are more welcoming attitudes shown in America, Africa, Europe, South Asia as well as Asia-Pacific region. China hosted APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting) in 2014 and the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/971038.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G20</a> in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is the largest country in the world in terms of population, and Indonesia is the fourth largest. Therefore, the two countries will be important players in this region as well as in the world.</p>

<p>H.E. Rashed AlQemzi</p>
<p>&nbsp;Consul General of the UAE in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>China is a peaceful country in all aspects. I can feel the peace in my daily life and in my daily work as a diplomat. The country has witnessed a fast increase during the past 70 years, such as in the science and technology sectors. For some countries, they can grow fast but they may stop at a certain level. However, China maintains stable development on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Decades ago, China was more like an agricultural field, with more farming, more agriculture. But now China is the second-largest economy in the world. A few years later, I believe myself it will be the first economy, not the second. That shows the development and changes between the past and nowadays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in Shanghai. I witnessed a lot &#8211; like Shanghai is an international city. The city has achieved a lot of things during the past 70 years. People all want to come here.</p>

<p><strong>Sabri Tunc Angili</p>
<p>Consul General of Turkey in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>China has become one of the leading powers guiding the way that the global community goes as the second-largest economy and the most populous country in the world. Now China is much more significant in global politics and economics than 70 years ago.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the reform and opening-up policy, progress is one of the defining features of China&#8217;s development. I recognized [that] with my own eyes when I first came to Shanghai in 2008. Now Shanghai is much more developed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s development is good for Chinese people of course, but also good for the world at large. Because during this rapid development of China, especially in the last 40 years, millions of Chinese people got rid of poverty, which is good for global prosperity. It had a positive impact on United Nations developments. I think China&#8217;s development or progress models inspire many developing countries around the world.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Robinson</p>
<p>Consul General of New Zealand in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>China&#8217;s development since 1949 has been remarkably wide ranging. It covers just about every sector, from education to healthcare standards, in a range of other social well-being measures as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s development in the past 70 years has been really the result of an incredible amount of dedication and hard work from the top right down to the average person on the street. China&#8217;s development therefore is real accredit to Chinese people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consul General of Argentina in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>It is the most impressive progress for China taking people out of poverty in just a few decades. Right now hundreds and millions of people have a better life.</p>
<p>I want to use the word &#8220;openness&#8221; to describe China&#8217;s development during the past 70 years. Because it relates to how China sees [its] relationship with other countries in the world. I personally worked for Argentina in the WTO several years ago. I started to work in 2001 when China entered the WTO. I can see myself how China was becoming such an important participant of the multilateral system in a very constructive way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is creating a new type of development which is inclusive, as the country cares [about] people to improve their quality of life.</p>

<p>The most important thing that China has achieved is the alleviation of poverty.&nbsp; That is easy to say, but very difficult to achieve. This is a major success of the Chinese government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an important change that I see in China &#8211; the combat against climate change and the way Chinese people are tackling pollution. I mean not only air pollution but also water management, which means Chinese people are cleaning out the rivers, the lakes, the ocean, and also the waste in the garbage regulation. All of this is part of a larger effort that China is now conducting to comply with the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda, that has set 17 sustainable development goals. </p>

<p>China throughout 70 years went through incredible development. Some parts of the stories are not very good, but the huge part of the story is extremely important and successful. He [Deng Xiaoping] recognized the potential of Chinese people and he basically just opened the door for Chinese businessmen and incredibly hardworking Chinese people to realize their dreams, their China dreams. What happened in the next 40 years, us, the rest of the world were watching with open mouths.</p>

<p>The growth China has achieved is certainly unprecedented in the history of mankind, and this is why it is called the &#8220;Chinese miracle.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A huge segment of Chinese people was lifted out of poverty. A very robust middle class has emerged. Almost every aspect of the daily lives of Chinese has been improved, including education, healthcare and social security.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s development is not focused on itself exclusively. It has a very particular understanding vision of international relations, which is a very cooperative one. China wants to engage in a win-win cooperation, and it does that with very tangible projects such as the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, which Greece has also benefited from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most obvious changes that China has gone [through] are the impressive rise in life expectancy, the mandatory nine-year education system being applied across the country and the emergence of China as a major global power.</p>
<p>Chinese development has been extremely innovative and interlinked with innovation in every field such as renewable energy, information communication technology and others.</p>

<p>China has been able to achieve tremendous growth. Even if the growth is now slowing down a little bit, it&#8217;s still really a very high number.</p>
<p>China has lifted such huge amounts of people out of poverty during the past 70 years, which is the most impressive development. There are some other aspects like the opening-up of China, which is not only for business from abroad but also now Chinese are traveling more &#8211; they are going abroad as students.</p>
<p>China is now entering into an age of high technology and innovation, bringing Chinese business to the next level, not only being a place where a lot of companies come to produce things, but now China has become an inventor itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lot of countries are really impressed by what China has achieved in the recent years. It&#8217;s just evident now [that] China is a global power worldwide which means it goes with a global responsibility. Whatever decision China takes, it will have a global impact.</p>
<p>I think this means China is now in the league of the most powerful nations on earth which is the biggest development I can see from myself.</p>
<p>I find it very interesting that a lot people are coming from Switzerland to China. They are here to learn from China. Last April, we had 16 groups from Swiss universities coming to Shanghai, saying &#8220;we want to learn from this great country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Consul General of Italy in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>During the past 70 years, China&#8217;s development has been stunning, harmonious and increasingly sustainable.</p>
<p>Chinese development has been without precedent in history from [being] a rural poor country. It has experienced strong growth through manufacturing and has become today the second-largest economy in the world, at the epicenter for new technologies and innovation. It is important that this development has been managed by the same time as safeguarding social harmony and promoting the eradication of poverty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that Italy, being universally recognized as the country of beauty of quality and innovation, is the perfect partner for China to proceed along this path.</p>

<p>Consul General of the Republic of Fiji in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>In the span of 70 years, China has transformed itself from a relatively poor country to now a modern and progressive society. China is the only country in the world, in such a short span, to lift 700 million people out of poverty. I think it&#8217;s something about the Chinese leadership in terms of planning and the policies in place.</p>
<p>China is taking a global leadership [role], especially now, its role in defending the global trading system. Countries need to trade with each other and not be protective. Like for Fiji, we need countries to open doors and have market access. That&#8217;s why the CIIE (China International Import Expo) becomes important.</p>
<p>Chinese leadership in the global stage is also a peaceful one. For Fiji, we welcome China&#8217;s Belt and Road Initiative, which focuses on the building of infrastructure, having more people to people exchange and better understanding of each other&#8217;s culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Isomata Akio&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consul General of Japan in Shanghai</strong></p>
<p>The development of China, especially since 1978 (when the policy of reform and opening-up started), has brought about big changes to the economic welfare of the people. It has also brought about a big change in the status of China in the world, having China assume greater roles in world affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reform and opening-up policy has provided chances to people inside and outside China, especially in the economic field. That is why we see China as it is now. As China continues to develop, it has to consider not only the speed of growth, but also the way it develops, such as an inclusive way of growth or an environmentally friendly way of development.</p>
<p>As China faces these challenges, Japan, as a good partner for tackling global issues and pursuing quality of life for people, is willing to cooperate further with China, in fields such as world economy and free trade, innovation, energy saving and environment, medical and health care, food [and] tourism.</p>

<p>The most obvious change that China has gone through for the last 70 years is that from its foundation up to now, it has upheld its beliefs in governance. [It has] ensured that the development is all across the country. And that it has continued to be innovative in all areas of modern technology, while preserving its traditional culture. The impressive changes in China for us are that it has built its infrastructure with great standards. It has built its education system as well as social assistance systems in order to ensure that the development is people-centric and that uplifts living standards of all Chinese citizens.</p>

<p>A bus stopped in the farmland of Qianwei ecological village in Chongming district in Shanghai. Then dozens of middle-aged and elderly individuals got off the bus and headed toward vendors that sell organic fruits and vegetables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much is the watermelon?&#8221; &#8220;Can I taste your tomatoes?&#8221; were some of the conversation starters between the vendors and tourists that lasted over 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhang Ailian (pseudonym), a 50-something tourist in the group, was eating a piece of watermelon at a stall. She told the Global Times that shopping is actually part of the agenda during their Chongming district tour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Watermelons planted in Chongming district taste much fresher than those sold in supermarkets in [downtown] Shanghai. The vegetables and fruits here are free from pesticides, so I decided to buy some and bring them back home,&#8221; Zhang said, adding that she and most members in her tourist group are from urban Shanghai.</p>

<p><strong>A popular tourist destination</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>Over the past few years, the development of the tourism industry in Chongming district has made the district a popular tourist destination for people in nearby regions.</p>
<p>Li Zhuang (pseudonym), an electronic sightseeing vehicle driver at Qianwei ecological village, told the Global Times that the place where the tourists shop for vegetables and fruits is called the Rose Garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Rose Garden, one can not only see roses, but also seasonal fruits and vegetables. Tourists can come to the garden to pick seasonal fruits such as strawberries and tomatoes as a leisurely activity,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li added the Rose Garden is still under construction, and in the near future, there will be more entertainment infrastructures, including a man-made beach.</p>
<p>According to the Chongming Tourism Bureau, the tourism industry in the district has been continuously growing in recent years. The district received over 5.76 million tourists in 2017, which generated around 1.2 billion yuan ($174.29 million), the Shanghai Observer reported in April 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highlights of tourist attractions in Chongming district include nature reserves and parks, such as Dongping National Forest Park, Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve, and Xisha Wetland Park. Peasant-household tourism which allows travelers to experience local delicacies and countryside activities is also booming in the district.</p>
<p>Mao Qin, 40-something, is operating a happy farmhouse business with her husband and father in Qianwei ecological village. Her four-story farmhouse has 16 rooms for accommodation, two spacious rooms for dining, several rooms for playing mahjong and cards, and one big room for singing karaoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;My parents started to run the happy farmhouse business around 2000. I took the business from them in 2007,&#8221; Mao told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said her family business was already on the right track when she took over, and the scale was much larger compared with the start-up stage. But being from a younger generation of operators, Mao and her husband realized the importance of the internet to promote the family business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Around 2007, we started to post pictures and information of our rooms online. After being exposed online for around six months, the number of our clients soon increased. We received more and more calls about our services,&#8221; she told the Global Times.</p>

<p><strong>One-stop service</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>Yan Ming, 20-something, stayed in Mao&#8217;s accommodation. She said she came here with her colleagues for team building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The room condition is not as ideal as those at economical hotels downtown, but the price is really cheap,&#8221; Yan told the Global Times. &#8220;Living at the inn for one night, and eating four meals at the inn only costs around 200 yuan.&#8221;</p>
<p>One-stop service is a selling point of the village&#8217;s happy farmhouse business. &#8220;A 280 yuan package per person covers the fees of many services, including a one-night accommodation, four meals, and tickets to three tourist spots,&#8221; Mao said.</p>
<p>The peasant-household business at her village was initiated by the village administrators, according to Mao. &#8220;At first only a dozen families were willing to join the program. My parents were among them,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>She pointed out that the tourism business in her village witnessed a big improvement after 2009, which was the same year that the bridge that connects downtown Shanghai to Chongming Island was officially opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Previously, travelers in [downtown] Shanghai had to take boats to Chongming Island,&#8221; Mao said. &#8220;Since 2009 we have seen a growing number of tourist groups, company staff and individual travelers coming here for team building, traveling or family gatherings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mao said there are over 100 independent happy farmhouses in her village, but only a dozen of them are the same size as her farmhouse business. &#8220;I am also collaborating with 10 smaller farmhouses. When there was no room in my inn for travelers, I would arrange my clients to live in other farmhouses. But they don&#8217;t provide meals or entertainment services like us,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Mao said the busiest time for her business is during statutory holidays, such as the Spring Festival holiday, the National Day holiday and the May Day holiday, as well as weekends. &#8220;April and May are the busiest months, but July and August are the slowest months, as the weather is too hot in the district,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Moscow resident Bruma Tatiana, 65, carefully drew a watercolor plant on an easel. Seated at the city&#8217;s VDNH Park and Exhibition Center along with a dozen local elderly ladies, she leisurely colored every petal of the flower under the curious gaze of visitors.</p>
<p>It was at the Third Forum of Social Innovations of the Regions being held in Moscow between June 19 and 21, where a series of issues related to social development and residents&#8217; livelihoods were exhibited and discussed, including education, health care and longevity.</p>
<p>During the three-day event, Tatiana as well as more than 100 other elderly people took part in several activities such as painting, dancing, gymnastics and handicrafts at the forum&#8217;s Longevity Park pavilion to show the visitors what their retired life is like after the local government launched a project named Moscow Longevity in March 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Classes for free</p>
<p></strong>The aim of the Moscow Longevity project for senior citizens is to provide more opportunities for leisure activities for the elderly generation, which was introduced by Vladimir Filippov, deputy head of the Department of Labor and Social Protection of the Population of the City of Moscow.</p>
<p>The project offers local elderly people various classes that include general physical training, dancing, gymnastics, crafts, drawing and chess. More academic lessons such as information technology (IT) and English are available as well. Muscovite females and males respectively aged 55 to 60 or above are able to take as many classes as they like for free, Filippov said.</p>
<p>Tatiana attended three of the project&#8217;s classes: drawing, dancing and gymnastics. Each class is held twice a week and lasts one hour. &#8220;These classes are not difficult for me,&#8221; she told the Global Times. &#8220;They are designed according to us old people&#8217;s learning ability, so I can easily grasp the knowledge and skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>After she retired five years ago, Tatiana&#8217;s time was once filled with housework and looking after her nine grandkids. Being busy with household affairs all day made her exhausted. &#8220;But now I have become much more energetic by taking the classes, and I&#8217;ve made friends here,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The changes in Tatiana&#8217;s life echo the main purposes of this project. &#8220;In Moscow we have more than 3 million people aged 55 and older, and the number is growing,&#8221; Filippov said to the Global Times. &#8220;For this expanding group, how to strive against loneliness, as well as how to make good use of their free time, are two challenges that the Moscow Longevity project is trying to help deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date some 160,000 elderly Muscovites have been constantly engaged in this project, according to the project staff. Ladies seem particularly interested in it as 87 percent of its participants are females.</p>
<p>Ellada Baranova, 65, has been part of the project for a year. She registered for as many as 12 classes including breathing exercising and model dressing, which makes her retired life rich and colorful.</p>
<p>&#8220;(My daily life is) full of lessons. Fitness at 9 am, running at 11 am&#8230;&#8221; she explained, adding that she is even busier than when she was at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;But taking the classes has brought me a lot of pleasure. I make friends there, and we chat and share something new with each other, so I&#8217;m not isolated anymore,&#8221; Baranova told the Global Times. &#8220;I really enjoy it.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Elderly people benefit</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>The project&#8217;s classes are held at community centers across the city, Filippov said. Senior citizens can take the classes near where they live.</p>
<p>Irina Chikova, a local community center staffer, teaches gymnastics and Chinese painting under the project. &#8220;I teach four times a week, attracting 10 to 20 grannies each time,&#8221; she said at the forum&#8217;s Longevity Park pavilion, where she drew a purple plant as an example for her students.</p>
<p>Unlike younger people who are still busy making money, retired elderly people usually enjoy more time and energy to do what they like, Chikova said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have the motivation to learn, and what they learn here can benefit them,&#8221; she told the Global Times. &#8220;The two lessons I teach, for example, are gymnastics which is good for aging people&#8217;s body, especially their back, and Chinese painting can improve their concentration and mood.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>$50 million per year</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>The average life expectancy of Moscow residents has reached 78 years old, eight years longer than in 2010, Filippov introduced.</p>
<p>Similar to many other metropolises around the world, Moscow&#8217;s aging population is increasing fast. &#8220;The life expectancy of Muscovites is expected to reach 86 years old by 2030,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At that time, Moscow may have over 4 million retired people, 1 million more than the current number.&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore, the local government launched the Moscow Longevity project to better serve this growing group, costing $50 million per year.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to a recent survey, one third of the participants said they feel better physically and mentally after taking the project&#8217;s classes,&#8221; Filippov told the Global Times.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<p>Several years ago, when China was increasingly feeling the phenomenon of Hallyu (the &#8220;Korean Wave&#8221;), South Korean TV series as well as fashion gained overwhelming popularity among Chinese audiences and consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many young Chinese girls imitated the fashion of Jun Ji-hyun, who starred in the popular drama<br />
<em>You Who Came From The Stars</em> (2013-14), which boosted the popularity of many South Korean niche brands among Chinese consumers. However, the trend may have been reversed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, South Korean media exposed a case in which a senior South Korean fashion designer, who hasn&#8217;t been identified, sold Chinese clothes disguised as Korean products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese designs and fashions were considered as corny and out of date, but now, it seems they have caught up with their South Korean neighbors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a Yonhap News Agency report, the designer sold 6,946 Chinese pieces of clothing worth about 700 million won ($605,661) in major department stores across South Korea between June 2017 and March 2019 by falsely marking the place of origin of the items as being from South Korea and labeling them as designer clothes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fashion designer bought Chinese T-shirts for around 10,000 won from Dongdaemun Market in Seoul and sold them for between 60,000 won and 70,000 won in department stores. He has been fined 44 million won by South Korea&#8217;s customs agency.&nbsp;</p>

</center> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 3px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold">Consumers at the Qipu Road clothing market in Shanghai Photo: Du Qiongfang/GT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open labeling</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>Although the case happened in South Korea and seems to have nothing to do with Chinese consumers, the global distribution of the apparel industry chain makes it impossible for Chinese consumers to remain aloof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to China&#8217;s relatively cheap labor costs, China has many original equipment manufacturers that produce garments for foreign companies, including both international luxury brands as well as niche designer brands, with &#8220;Made in China&#8221; labels. However, there are also some small- and medium-sized plants where garments are produced with or without labels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manager of a clothes factory located in Shaoxing, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, surnamed Luo, told the Global Times that her foreign customers would provide &#8220;Made in China&#8221; labels for their orders of goods. &#8220;The garments have to be labeled with the place of origin as China where they are actually produced,&#8221; Luo said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the manager of another clothes plant admitted that some foreign customers do not require the manufacturer to label the garments. &#8220;Since we have sold the garments, we don&#8217;t care how they will label them,&#8221; said the manager who did not disclose his name.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Selling power</p>
<p></strong>Apart from the fact that the labels can be changed, or a false place of origin can be attached in the production process, it also happens in the sales process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a crowded building at the popular Qipu Road clothing market in Shanghai, where garment booths conduct wholesale and retail business, several booth owners or staffers told the Global Times that there are foreign clothing companies that buy clothes at the market.</p>
<p>A booth owner, who was unwilling to disclose his identity, told the Global Times that big foreign clothes companies usually attend large-scale clothing expos and procurement fairs to choose their cooperative Chinese clothes manufacturers, but some small-sized and individual foreign clothes retailers purchase small batches of garments at the Qipu Road market and sell them in foreign countries. They also buy Chinese designed and produced garments as samples for them to copy and produce in their own countries. &#8220;As salespeople, we don&#8217;t care what the foreign customers do with the garments,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a booth selling designer brand clothing in the market, a Global Times journalist discovered that there is only a size label attached to the clothes. The brand and the place of origin are printed on the hand tag, which is easy to remove.</p>
<p>A sales person surnamed Liu selling South Korean children&#8217;s garments told the Global Times that some overseas buyers purchase small batches of clothes at his booths and ship them overseas by sea or by air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Salespersons at a booth told the Global Times that foreign customers usually purchase the garments at the booth in person. If there are enough goods in stock at the booth, they can directly send them overseas by a courier. &#8220;And if they attach their own labels, the garments become South Korean products,&#8221; a saleswoman told the Global Times. &#8220;But we have no knowledge about the price difference between &#8216;Made in China&#8217; and &#8216;Made in South Korea,&#8217; in the South Korean market,&#8221; she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />

<p style="margin-top: 3px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold">Handwritten price tags Photo: VCG</p>
<p><strong>Pricing quality</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>In the aforementioned case, the garments the designer sold at major department stores were six-fold or seven-fold pricier than what the unidentified fashion designer paid at the Dongdaemun Market. So, the Global Times tried to figure out the price differences of the clothes sold at Dongdaemun and Qipu Road markets.</p>
<p>A consumer surnamed Zhang thinks &#8220;you get what you pay for&#8221; at the Qipu Road market. &#8220;The texture of cheaper clothes is relatively rougher and coarser,&#8221; Zhang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhang, who bought clothes at Dongdaemun Market, thinks that compared with the clothing prices there, the prices of the clothes at the Qipu Road market are artificially inflated. &#8220;At Dongdaemun market, I know the quality of clothes I can buy with 50 yuan ($7.26), but here, I am not sure if the clothes I buy are worth the prices I pay,&#8221; said Zhang who added that wholesale prices at Dongdaemun Market are cheaper than those at Qipu Road market, so some booth owners here purchase clothes at Dongdaemun Market and sell them at the Qipu Road market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A customer surnamed Wei who travels to South Korea once every two years thinks that it is not easy to figure out if the clothes that are labeled as South Korean products are indeed made in South Korea. &#8220;I used to check the labels, but now the labels seem to be identical to each other and I cannot figure out if they are authentic or not. But I can figure out that they are not made in South Korea through their quality,&#8221; Wei said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A customer surnamed Liu thinks that since many foreign brands have their clothes produced in China, there is not much difference in the quality. &#8220;The major difference lies in the brands,&#8221; Liu said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the price differences of clothes with the same or similar qualities in different countries, Liu thinks that the clothing prices are related to local residents&#8217; income. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<div align="left">
 As the<br />
 <em>gaokao</em>, China&#8217;s national college entrance examination and the biggest and most competitive test in the country, approaches, immigration companies are wasting no time advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want your kids to win at the starting line?&#8221; one such ad with a heavy-handed parent-bait tagline asks. &#8220;Get a foreign residence today and go to top universities tomorrow!&#8221;</p>
<p>Some parents felt aggrieved about the perceived unfairness in the ultra-competitive admissions process. However, other parents acted immediately to see if their kids, too, could somehow obtain a foreign residence and thusly replicate the success of their peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Golden Visas,&#8221; mainly introduced to the investors by countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Portugal that suffered heavy financial crises in recent decades in order to boost inward investment, have become the latest trend among well-off Chinese families.</p>
<p>Such visas allow the investors to obtain residence permits and even citizenship in these nations by investing a certain amount in local properties.</p>
<p>Compared with higher-profile immigration destinations like the US, the UK, Canada and Australia, the low threshold of requirements for &#8220;Golden Visas&#8221; has helped make them quite popular among many parents in China.</p>
<p>This surging popularity could also have consequences, as rumors are being spread that some countries are considering scrapping their Golden Visas, causing many Chinese parents to scramble and pay steep fees to the immigration companies before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p> <strong>It&#8217;s all Greek to me</strong></p>
<p>Zhou Haiyan, a 41-year-old mother from Beijing, moved to Greece one year ago just so that she could provide her 8-year-old daughter with more and better education opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The price of private schools there, such as ACS [American Community Schools of Athens] costs only half of what private international schools in China charge,&#8221; Zhou told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;So why not pay less for a better education and better environment? And in Greece you can also opt in to the public school system, totally free of charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zhou added that her first choice was of course the US, but the steep cost of living and exorbitant tuition, as well as the country&#8217;s notoriously lax gun ownership laws and other uncertainties about their safety, made them think twice.</p>
<p>When asked if they had successfully blended in with their Greek community, Zhou said her daughter had no problems acclimating but for her husband and herself, the change was not as easy, primarily because of the language.</p>
<p>Another serious issue for the Zhous is that, because their residence there was obtained solely through a property investment, their so-called Golden Visa does not allow them to work in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know we Chinese like to work. So we get bored without jobs and it has also caused us some financial pressure,&#8221; Zhou, an artist who dabbles in freelance painting to earn pocket money, told the Global Times.</p>
<p> <strong>Alternative paths</strong></p>
<p>According to public data on enterprisegreece.gov.gr, an official institution which keeps records of various investment activities in Greece, as of November 30, 2018, a total of 22,730 foreigners have successfully applied for their Golden Visas via the property investment program.</p>
<p>The scheme has brought more than 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) to the Hellenic government. Qiao Yugui, a 45-year-old mother from Anyang, Central China&#8217;s Henan Province, is another such successful Chinese applicant.</p>
<p>She and her family expatriated to Greece two years ago. Instead of investing all their money in a single property, however, Qiao smartly purchased two smaller apartments &#8211; one to live in and one to rent out in order to recoup their investment. She said that thus far, her 11-year-old seems very happy about living and going to school in Greece.</p>
<p>In 2018, a total of 9,756 permanent residences were granted, with the majority &#8211; 55 percent &#8211; going to Chinese investors such as Qiao and Zhou. That figure is five times the number of follow-up buyers from Turkey and Russia.</p>
<p>Zhao Yi, who has been following property investments in V2 Development, a Greece-based company, for years, said that almost half of all Chinese investors still live in China due to their careers. Their foreign residence, then, is simply to keep open an alternative path for their children should they ever find themselves in a predicament.</p>
<p> <strong>While we&#8217;re here&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The same goes for Greece&#8217;s neighboring country, the Republic of Cyprus, a large island nation in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Zhang Xin, the China office manager of Leptos Estates, landed the job the moment Cyprus initiated its own property investment scheme in 2012. She explained that most Chinese are not concerned about a return on their investments so much as they are concerned about enrolling their children into an international school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qiao confirmed this sentiment. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s much easier to get into a top university in China if you can claim permanent residence in another country. But now that we are here, I actually prefer our daughter attend an actual foreign university.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lisa Li, who immigrated to Canada two years ago, has only positive words to say about that nation&#8217;s education, environment and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>But she has nonetheless found it rather difficult to blend in. &#8220;Canada is very open and inclusive compared to many other countries. But it&#8217;s still not easy to make friends with [Canadians], and the language barrier is a deep chasm,&#8221; Li told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are other problems we have to face, such as racism, guns, the use of cannabis [legal for recreational purposes in Canada], and excessive sex education in their schools,&#8221; Li lamented, adding that as her children are only in kindergarten, she has not given much thought yet as to where they should attend university.</p>
<p> <strong><em><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1050346.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaokao</a></em> immigrants</strong></p>
<p>Officially, whether or not a foreign residence makes it easier for Chinese students to be accepted into a top-tier Chinese university remains unclear.</p>
<p>Wang, head of a Beijing-based educational company that consults with foreign students who wish to take part in China&#8217;s<br />
 <em>gaokao</em>, told the Global Times that there is a &#8220;big misunderstanding&#8221; about Golden Visas and the gimmicky taglines being used to bait Chinese investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to the<br />
 <em>gaokao</em>, there is a huge difference between having a Chinese nationality with a foreign residence and being a Chinese from a foreign country,&#8221; Wang said.</p>
<p>According to Wang, the official policy about Chinese nationals obtaining foreign residences was tightened after news about &#8221;<br />
 <em>gaokao</em> immigrants&#8221; went viral. &#8220;For Chinese with foreign nationalities, they are treated the same as real foreigners, so it is much easier for them to get admitted by a top university in China.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the amount of time you have to spend overseas should not be ignored,&#8221; Wang warned. &#8220;It is required that you hold a valid foreign passport for more than four years and can prove that you lived abroad for more than two years in the past four years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the prescribed qualifications are met, all you need to do is take a test and fill out an application,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p> <strong>No such thing as a shortcut</strong></p>
<p>But the requirements are vastly different for those Chinese claiming a foreign residence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang told the Global Times that it is almost impossible for Chinese with foreign residence to get into any top Chinese universities with negligible effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The difficulty is almost the same as the<br />
 <em>gaokao</em> is for mainland students. The only difference may be in the subject matter. Politics and biology are not included in the joint admission exam, and there is a different emphasis in the other subjects,&#8221; Wang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is required,&#8221; Wang explained, &#8220;that those students and at least one of their parents must live in the country of their foreign residence for a continuous two-year period and a cumulative period of no less than 18 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those Chinese who are pursuing shortcuts, Wang suggested they ask themselves two profound questions: whether they are willing to trade their Chinese nationalities just for the chance of their kid getting into a top university in China, and if they are prepared for potential changes in the policy.</p>
