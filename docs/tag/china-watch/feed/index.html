<p>China&#8217;s state broadcasters consecutively aired three documentaries from Thursday illustrating the anti-terrorism efforts in Northwest China&#8217;s<br />
 <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region, a terrorist organization East Turkistan Islamic Movement&#8217;s (ETIM) role in plotting terrorist attacks in China and US hypocrisy on human rights issues. The documentaries sparked wide discussions on domestic and overseas media.</p>
<p>Many netizens commented that the documentaries disclosed rare video footage on terrorist attacks that Xinjiang had suffered, fully reflecting the severe threat of terrorism Xinjiang was facing. They also said Western media that criticized China&#8217;s Xinjiang policies should watch these videos carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But many Western media, especially those which tried to hype the &#8220;leaked documents&#8221; on vocational education and training centers in Xinjiang in recent weeks, kept silent over the heated discussions on the Chinese mainland generated by the documentaries.</p>
<p>Chinese mainland experts said that some Western media outlets selectively report what fits their stereotypes and interests. These outlets also went great lengths to slander on Xinjiang. Their silence on the documentaries showed their double standards in regards to China&#8217;s Xinjiang issues, they said.</p>
<p>Two of the three documentaries were newly made and aired on CGTN on Thursday and Saturday respectively, telling of the overall counter-terrorism work in Xinjiang and ETIM&#8217;s role in inciting terrorist attacks in China&#8217;s Xinjiang and other Chinese&nbsp;cities.</p>
<p>One documentary, initially aired in April 2018, was streamed again on CGTN on Friday night, deploring the human rights crisis created by the US in the Middle East since 2003.</p>
<p>Topics of &#8220;New documentaries on Xinjiang&#8217;s anti-terrorism work&#8221; and &#8220;Unveiling the black hand behind Xinjiang&#8217;s terrorism&#8221; were viewed 390 million times and 230 million times respectively on Sina Weibo, China&#8217;s Twitter-like social media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CGTN also uploaded these two documentaries on YouTube and the first episode, &#8220;Fighting terrorism in Xinjiang&#8221; was watched more than 150,000 times.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />&nbsp;
</div>
<p>Some internet users commented on Sina Weibo that they had visited Xinjiang and enjoyed the splendid landscape, friendly atmosphere and safety, but they had no idea that Xinjiang used to suffer such grim terrorism and extremism threats.</p>
<p>Leonard Brownies, one&nbsp; internet user from abroad commented on Twitter after watching one documentary that &#8220;This is FACT. Some stupid Western fake news media should see this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The documentaries were &#8220;very touching and reflect truth on Xinjiang in a clear way,&#8221; Erkin Oncan, a Turkish reporter, told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike the Western propaganda news, the documentaries tell what was really happening in Xinjiang by original videos and remarks of witnesses and participants of terrorist attacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>
<strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Pretending to be blind</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few Western media outlets reported discussions about the documentaries on the Chinese internet as of press time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is in sharp contrast to extensive coverage by Western media such as the 17&nbsp;media partners of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on &#8220;leaked government files&#8221; on Xinjiang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erkin said that he was not surprised to see many Western media &#8220;pretend to be blind&#8221; at the Chinese documentaries as their reports on Xinjiang were in line with &#8220;some Western countries&#8217; political agenda, not with the principles of journalism.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By making public rare video footage of terrorist attacks including the Urumqi riots on July 5, 2009 and the Tiananmen Square terror attack on October 28, 2013, &#8220;the documentaries tear the hypocrisy mask off the US,&#8221; said Li Wei, a counter-terrorism expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It claims to protect human rights but supports terrorist groups and interferes in China&#8217;s domestic affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some Western media and US politicians, who know clearly the previous severe terrorist threat in Xinjiang and still chose to smear China&#8217;s anti-terrorism policies in the region, they would ignore the documentaries on purpose, Li asserted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;They give no care to the truth but want to hype Xinjiang issue to make troubles for China,&#8221; he said..</p>
<p>&#8220;These documentaries disclosed many rare and original video footages of terrorist attacks happened in Xinjiang and other cities in China. China used to release some information on terrorist attacks but images of the documentaries are more powerful than words.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li said that the bloody scenes of terrorist attacks, the cruelty of terrorists and the tragedy of innocent people&#8217;s deaths not only left a strong impression on the audience but also reminded people the hefty price the regional government and local people have paid for restoring peace and stability in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Li told the Global Times that these documentaries target people who were fooled by fake news of some Western media but wanted to know true stories of Xinjiang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that people who have conscience would get to know and give just comment on China&#8217;s strenuous efforts on countering terrorism and on protecting local residents&#8217; human rights in Xinjiang,&#8221; said Li.&nbsp;</p>

<p></font>China&#8217;s internet and game company NetEase apologized for firing an employee even though he had an &#8220;incurable disease,&#8221; admitting that those who dealt with the incident were &#8220;simple, brash and impersonal.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We apologize to our former colleague, his family and the public. We are sorry, we&#8217;ve made a mistake,&#8221; NetEase said in an announcement released on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apology came after an online article written by the employee, who accuses the company of sacking him after he was diagnosed with heart diseases in January.</p>
<p>The employee, who had worked for NetEase&#8217;s videogame department for five years, said the company tried various ways to force him to leave, including not paying his bonus, being picky about his work performance and attendance, saying he was &#8220;unqualified&#8221; for the job. It even called security guards to force him to leave.</p>
<p>The employee inserted an audio recording in his article as evidence of his bad treatment.</p>
<p>The letter sparked huge reaction on social media, and the hashtag &#8220;NetEase&#8221; was viewed 280 million as of press time. Many netizens criticized the company for its inhumane treatment employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NetEase said it received the request for dismissal from the former employee&#8217;s supervisor, who said his work performance was &#8220;unsatisfactory.&#8221; The supervisor didn&#8217;t fully understand the employee&#8217;s health situation, the statement said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company said it had paid the man on time during his three-month sick leave. However, employees from the company&#8217;s human resources department failed to handle the man&#8217;s departure from the company in a proper way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>NetEase said that it will pay the man 12 months basic salary and provide other assistance he might require.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet users discussed the infamous &#8220;996&#8221; overtime schedule which many employees of China&#8217;s internet companies are required to work. The numbers refer to a workday that lasts from 9 am to 9 pm and a six-day workweek, a schedule that many people say is hurting their health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s not only NetEase that behaves like this. I work for an internet company where there are many similar cases but most people choose to remain silent,&#8221; said a Sina Weibo user.

<p>The Chinese Embassy in Australia said on Saturday that Chinese people don&#8217;t welcome people who make unwarranted attacks and disrespect China&#8217;s dignity after the country denied entry to Liberal MPs Andrew Hastie and James Paterson.</p>
<p>Hastie and Paterson have both been publicly critical of the Chinese government. Hastie sparked a political and diplomatic controversy in August when he compared China to Nazi Germany, local media reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The embassy stated that China is open to constructive dialogue and exchanges with people from all parts of the world on the basis of mutual respect, equality and seeking common ground while reserving differences.</p>
<p>The colonial days of Western powers are long gone, and China will never yield to colonization of ideas and values, said the embassy&#8217;s statement said. As long as the people concerned genuinely repent and redress their mistakes, view China with objectivity and reason, respect China&#8217;s system and mode of development chosen by the Chinese people, the door to dialogue and exchanges will always remain open.</p>

<p>International students celebrated Confucius Institute scholarships at the Confucius Institute&#8217;s headquarters in Beijing, during its Open Day on November 8.</p>
<p>Representatives of diplomatic envoys and officials of cultural institutions from 30 countries, including those from countries that have shown interest in opening Confucius Institutes, participated in the event.</p>
<p>The officials from the US Embassy to China joined the celebration for the first time, and a Utah State Senator also came for discussion and consultancy in promoting the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK), an international standardized Chinese language test which ranks proficiency in the language, in Utah.</p>
<p>By 2018, 548 Confucius Institutes and 1,193 Confucius classrooms were established in 158 countries and regions, serving tens of millions of Chinese learners around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has become the most diversified international language education community in the world. Its open and inclusive education philosophy refutes the false accusations made up by a few countries, foreign students said.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Opportunities all over the world</span></strong></p>
<p>This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Confucius Institute Scholarship (CIS). Since it was established in 2009, nearly 50,000 students from 166 countries and regions have been awarded the scholarship. Some of them returned to their home countries to become Chinese language teachers or to be engaged in cultural exchanges, while others have settled down in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nishith Shah, from India, is one of them. He was awarded the scholarship in 2013 for spending one year in Central China&#8217;s Henan Province. When he returned to Mumbai, he founded the &#8220;India China Academy,&#8221; an institute committed to teaching Chinese and enhancing China-India cultural exchanges. It has trained more than 300 Indian students, aged 16 to 55, in language and cultural studies.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A graduate of Confucius Institute performs Chinese kuaiban on Friday. Photo: Courtesy of Confucius Institute Headquarters</p>
<p>The scholarship is open to global in-service teachers and students who are interested in a Chinese education career after graduation.</p>
<p>The Confucius Institute headquarters has been continuously diversifying its scholarships in recent years, such as granting the doctoral scholarships to students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Institute also launched the special scholarship scheme for students from countries along the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, with a purpose of enhancing mutual understanding and friendship with the people from these countries.</p>
<p>Rajiv Ranjit from Nepal gained his doctorate degree in Xiamen, South China&#8217;s Fujian Province, in 2018 upon scholarship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He thanked the Confucius Institute for providing him with a chance to understand China firsthand. He also expects the Confucius Institute headquarters to continue encouraging more Nepalese students to participate in teaching Chinese and making contributions to the cooperative China-Nepal strategic partnership.</p>
<p>Nguyen Thi Hoang Oanh, a director of Chinese studies at the Lac Hong University in Vietnam, said that Chinese has been more popular among Vietnamese youth since 2017. &#8220;From 2012 to 2016, there was only one class in our major every year, but we have expanded to five classes in 2019,&#8221; she said at the Open Day ceremony.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Serve to resolve conflicts</span></strong></p>
<p>Utah State Senator Jacob Anderegg turned up at the Open Day, with his passion of including HSK in the foreign language learning certification for Utah high school students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Utah is one of the states in the US that understands the importance of positive relations with China. &#8220;It is number one in Chinese education and has the largest Chinese learning population in the US,&#8221; Anderegg told the Global Times. As early as 2006, the Utah legislature established exchanges and cooperation relations with the People&#8217;s Congress of Liaoning Province in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is the conspiracy theory of what the purposes for those language learning are and what the Confucius Institutes efforts are. There is mistrust potentially, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s true, Anderegg told the Global Times, responding to how some in the West misconstrue the Confucius Institute as a political organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have found in Utah is that our language abilities actually propel this much further in our understanding of Chinese culture. I think that people who have those types of criticisms don&#8217;t have a lot of experience working one on one with China or having friendships with Chinese,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Anderegg said that now around 14,000 Utah K-12 students are learning Chinese. He believes that language can be a useful tool to help resolve certain aspects of conflicts between China and the US. &#8220;When you speak the same language, you can communicate effectively in ideas, concept and visions. When we have those common ties, it makes our progress going forward so much easier,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;China needs the US and the US needs China. The first and second largest economies on the planet will be working together for a long time. So for sure, those language abilities will help our children to be prepared for global future,&#8221; Anderegg said,</p>

<p>The International Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee (IDCPC) held a thematic briefing on the fourth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee on Friday, and invited more than 210 senior diplomats from more than 130 countries to the event.</p>
<p>Guo Yezhou, vice minister of the IDCPC, presided over the briefing, saying at the opening ceremony on Friday that the purpose of the thematic briefing is to let members of the international community have a better understanding of the CPC.</p>
<p>The department invited Shen Chunyao, director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People&#8217;s Congress Standing Committee, and Xin Xiangyang, a deputy head of the research center of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era at the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, to introduce the achievements of the plenary session and the goals of the CPC for the future.</p>
<p>The briefing focused on introducing and explaining the theme of the fourth plenary session: to uphold and improve the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and advance the modernization of China&#8217;s system and capacity for governance. Some foreign diplomats asked questions to Shen and Xin about what other countries could learn from China and the CPC.</p>
<p>Shen said that China has no intention of exporting China&#8217;s model. He quoted the report of the 19th CPC National Congress to answer the question, adding that the path, theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics offer a &#8220;new option for other countries and nations that want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xin gave an example of the advantage of China&#8217;s political system, which is the consistency of the policymaking. The task of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, which was set by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping about 40 years ago,&nbsp; will be realized next year, thanks to the hard work made by Chinese leaders in their eras, Xin said.</p>
<p>IDCPC Minister Song Tao met Shen and Xin before the briefing. Song said the event received many senior-ranking attendees, which showed that members of the international community want to learn about the spirit of the plenary session. He said the IDCPC would like to have more cooperation with relevant departments and institutes to publicize China&#8217;s system, to increase the influence of the system and improve international understanding and acceptance on the system.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">A model for the world</span></strong></p>
<p>Charge d&#8217; Affaires of the South African Embassy Debora Balatseng told the Global Times that the signal that she received from the plenary session is that &#8220;China is marching forward…and the confidence of Chinese people that China has taken the right path to take them where China would want to be… [China] should be a model for many countries around the globe, including my country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Compared with some major Western powers, such as the US, which is adding uncertainties to the world by implementing protectionism and unilateralism, China stands for multilateralism, and so do many other countries, she noted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The US is just one country, so if you [China] are committed to follow a multilateral trade system, continue with it. Nothing should shake you, you know you are on the right path, you know you have support, you know you have people behind you… so continue with that path… in that way we will all benefit from what China is doing,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vietnam and China share similarities as both are socialist countries under the leadership of a communist party. The modernization of system building and governance capacity proposed at this session is what Vietnam should learn from, Pham Thanh Binh, a deputy chief of mission of the Embassy of Vietnam to China, said. The system and capacity of a country&#8217;s governance is of great importance, which is related to the political, economic, cultural and social fields, he said.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">BRI and global governance</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI) was also frequently mentioned by diplomats during the interview session with reporters, as the fourth plenary session stressed that China will &#8220;take an active part in global governance, and continue to make contributions to the building of a community with a shared future for humanity,&#8221; according to the Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>Charge d&#8217; Affaires of the Pakistani Embassy Ahmed Farooq highly valued the China-Pakistan relationship and said that the most important thing is &#8220;we move to a shared vision for the future, which is based on win-win cooperation for all. In this regard, I would like to mention the BRI project and CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) that we have for Pakistan, which is cooperation based on the welfare and betterment for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abbie David, Grenadian ambassador to China, told the Global Times that &#8220;Just recently, there was a session in Grenada on BRI to promote it in the Caribbean for us to understand and become part of the Belt and Road. Grenada strongly supports BRI, and the cooperation of the two countries focuses on tourism, infrastructure and finance.&#8221;<br />

<div align="left">
<p>Soldiers of the Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) could one day get their own &#8220;iron man&#8221; suits that feature heavy firepower, special armor and flying capability, military experts said on Wednesday as the PLA is reportedly evaluating advanced exoskeleton systems.</p>
<p>Headed by the Equipment Department of the PLA Army, the Super Warrior 2019 Military Individual Exoskeleton System Challenge took place recently in Beijing, with other challenges held in Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province and Xi&#8217;an, Northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province, according to a statement the PLA Army&#8217;s WeChat account Renminlujun released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nearly 100 teams from research institutes, universities and companies participated in the competition, as their exoskeleton products were tested and compared. The suits were tested for ability to carry heavy weight, mobility in rough terrain and artillery ammo loading, the statement said.</p>
<p>Worn as a kind of exoskeleton, the suits are installed with intelligent systems that can read users&#8217; intention and synchronize with their movement. The suits are being designed to provide extra kinetic energy to help enhance the strength, speed and stamina of users.</p>
<p>Military experts said the competition will spur advances among product developers, with the PLA Army choosing the best products, getting new ideas and communicating with developers so they can develop new exoskeletons for the army&#8217;s use in future warfare.</p>

<p>In the future, exoskeletons could also be connected to a network that allows information sharing and integrate with heavier individual weapons like automatic grenade launchers and light machine guns, giving individual soldiers strong firepower, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The competition also featured suits with special armor protections and individual flight systems, including a flying board similar to the one showcased at the French Bastille Day parade in July and a jetpack that seems to be worn on the back and provide thrust from two engines, according to the Army statement.</p>
<p>The current exoskeleton systems are still basic, but in the future the armor, weapons and flight systems will be integrated into a power suit that could turn ordinary soldiers to &#8220;iron man&#8221; soldiers, Wei said. </p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Aerial photo taken on July 1, 2019 shows a formation which spells out the words &#8220;I LOVE HK&#8221; to celebrate the 22nd birthday of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Hong Kong.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chaos and violence again descended on Hong Kong this weekend as the city&#8217;s festering social unrest entered its 22nd week.</p>
<p>Tension flared during the weekend as rioters smashed up an office of the Xinhua News Agency, which experts said trampled over the city&#8217;s freedom of speech in defiance of the central government.</p>
<p>They predicted the violence will escalate ahead of the city&#8217;s upcoming district council elections.</p>
<p>Seven districts were engulfed by skirmishes between police and rioters on Sunday afternoon, as shops including Yoshinoya, Maxim&#8217;s and other companies were vandalized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police ordered Tamar Park closed after rioters issued an online announcement of an illegal gathering there on Sunday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 4 pm, a masked mob, some wielding fire extinguishers, vandalized facilities like turnstiles and smashed up glass panes of a customer service center in Sha Tin MTR station, the police said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those actions followed Saturday&#8217;s protests which involved assaulting police officers and vandalism of public buildings including the Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau office of the Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>Police said on Sunday more than 200 people were arrested who took part in the Saturday protests.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, the Xinhua office in Wan Chai was attacked for the first time, with its glass doors and windows smashed.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong-based commentator who only gave his surname as Ho told the Global Times that the fire was contained in time and did not cause any extensive damage.</p>
<p>Xinhua issued a statement later saying it was &#8220;strongly indignant&#8221; over the &#8220;barbaric act&#8221; and hoped the police seriously investigate the incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Targeting the Xinhua News Agency showed the rioters&#8217; grudge toward Chinese mainland organizations was tinted with an obvious political agenda, said Chen Xinxin, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.</p>
<p>The Xinhua&#8217;s Hong Kong office made a special contribution to Hong Kong&#8217;s return to the motherland and so has symbolic meaning, Chen believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vandalism was in obvious defiance of the central government and mainland organizations, he noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The move in some way also threatened the city&#8217;s freedom of speech… and is another infringement of Hong Kong&#8217;s law,&#8221; Chen said.</p>
<p>The Beijing-based All-China Journalists Association, the Hong Kong News Executives&#8217; Association both issued statements after the incident condemning the attack and demanding police look into it.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent violence</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday, MTR stations and businesses in Hong Kong&#8217;s densely populated commercial districts Causeway Bay, Wan Chai, Central, Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui again fell victim to vandalism and mob rampage.</p>
<p>The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong said Sunday morning that 54 people were injured and taken to hospital during Saturday&#8217;s protests and one man was in a serious condition.</p>
<p>According to a video clip circulating on local Hong Kong media, a group of black-clad rioters hit a man in Mong Kok and beat him to the ground, ripping off his underwear and leaving his face covered with blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Twitter, Hong Kong police described the act as &#8220;heinous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s identity remained unknown as of press time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Hong Kong police, rioters defied a police ban and illegally gathered at Victoria Park 2 pm on Saturday and the illegal gathering evolved into mass vandalism and violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong commentator Ho said he noticed that Saturday&#8217;s violence was upgraded from previous ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Previous riots usually start late and climaxed at 10pm,&#8221; said Ho. &#8220;But yesterday&#8217;s violent protests started early in the afternoon, which obviously posed a greater challenge for the police to contain.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another Hong Kong-based commentator who requested anonymity told the Global Times that with the looming Hong Kong district council elections this month, violent protesters intended to upgrade their violence, paralyze the city government and enlarge their influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anonymous commentator said his conclusion was based on the rioters expanding the targets for their violence to include Xinhua office for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong police said rioters threw Molotov cocktails, constructed fiery barricades and wielded planks with nails, ignoring the safety hazard they posed to pedestrians and neighboring residents.</p>
<p>The police said they confiscated 188 Molotov cocktails, several contraction batons and pepper sprays from rioters on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hongk Kong police confirmed to the Global Times that Andrew Chiu, a district counsellor, was attacked on Sunday&#8217;s clash and his ear was bitten off.</p>
<p><strong>Lam supported</strong></p>
<p>After concluding her visit to Shanghai to attend the Second China International Import Expo on Tuesday, Hong Kong&#8217;s Chief Executive Carrie Lam will depart for Beijing in the evening, the city government said in a statement on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day she will be received by Vice Premier Han Zheng. Lam will attend the third plenary meeting of the Leading Group for the Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Leading Group).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Leading Group, led by Han, held the first plenary meeting in August 2018 and the second in March this year where they endorsed measures to facilitate Hong Kong people to develop, work and reside in mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meeting would probably focus on facilitating people from Hong Kong and Macao to work and live on the mainland, Tang Fei, a member of Beijing-based Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>Such a move would help Hong Kong out of the current difficult situation and solve deep-rooted social problems including Hong Kong&#8217;s development within the Greater Bay Area, Tang believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He noted that Han&#8217;s meeting with Lam also would serve to dispel rumors that Beijing planned to replace Lam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows the central government&#8217;s strong support for Lam,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is very important to stabilize morale when the most urgent task for Hong Kong is to ease the violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hong Kong slipped into a technical recession as its economy shrank 3.2 per cent in the third quarter from the previous quarter amid ongoing social unrest, the city&#8217;s census and statistics department said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The decline between July and September followed a 0.4 percent drop in the second quarter, marking a fall in two consecutive quarters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s second aircraft carrier, the first domestically built, appears to be preparing for a possible commissioning ceremony since it returned from its eighth sea trial, photos and videos showed.</p>
<p>Troops in white naval uniforms lined the warship&#8217;s flight deck on the morning of October 24 and practiced an inspection ceremony, Hong Kong-based news website wenweipo.com reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A barge loaded with a crane approached the bow of the ship, as workers on the crane painted a huge &#8220;1&#8221; on the ship&#8217;s hull, according to photos and videos posted in the wenweipo.com report.</p>
<p>However, the number has since been erased and no further markings were visible as of Tuesday, the report said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Painting a hull number is usually a sign that a warship is about to join military service,&#8221; a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The moves mentioned in the report could indicate that the aircraft carrier will be commissioned soon, military enthusiasts said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s first aircraft carrier<br />
<em>Liaoning</em> was delivered and commissioned to the PLA Navy on September 25, 2012 in Dalian after years of refitting and sea trials. Then president and Central Military Commission chairman Hu Jintao endorsed the naming certificate of<br />
<em>Liaoning</em> in a commissioning ceremony, the Xinhua News Agency reported then.</p>
<p>Hu and then premier Wen Jiabao oversaw the ceremony, as Navy honor guards received inspection on board of the ship, according to the Xinhua report. </p>
<p>The<br />
<em>Liaoning</em> has the hull number 16, and many military observers expect the yet-to-be-named second carrier will bear the number 17. </p>
<p>The second aircraft carrier is moored at the Dalian Shipyard in Northeast China&#8217;s Liaoning Province, after it returned from its eighth sea trial held between October 15 and 20, wenweipo.com reported. </p>
<p>Military experts told the Global Times as the carrier first set out on its eighth sea trial the voyage would likely serve as an examination of the warship&#8217;s readiness for final delivery, and that they expected the ship to be commissioned into the Chinese Navy this year. </p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Model of the FL-2 long range multipurpose high-subsonic transport drone on display at a military-civilian equipment and technology expo in Xi&#8217;an, Northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province, in 2019.

<p>A Chinese company recently showcased an in-development stealth transport drone that features a hybrid of conventional and flying wing design, which could represent a trend for future large transport planes, analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Developed by Zhong Tian Guide Control Technology Co Ltd, the FL-2 stealth transport drone went on display at a recent military-civilian equipment and technology expo held in Xi&#8217;an, Northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province, Ordnance Industry Science Technology, a Xi&#8217;an-based periodical focused on the national defense industry, reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The aircraft has a flying wing aerodynamic design similar to the US&#8217; X-47B drone, but also has a pair of conventional V-shaped vertical tails, according to the report. Its fuselage also seems bulkier than other typical flying wing aircraft like the B-2 bomber.</p>
<p>Using two turbofan engines, the FL-2 has a liftoff weight of 22 tons, a ceiling of 15 kilometers, a cruise speed of 600 to 780 kilometers an hour, a max speed of 900 kilometers an hour, a range of 7,000 kilometers and an endurance of 10 hours, the periodical reported.</p>
<p>Developed as a long range multipurpose high-subsonic unmanned transport platform, the FL-2 has multiple cabins for carrying different types of cargo, or it can carry a single larger object, according to publicly available specifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FL-2 is still in its conceptual design stage, according to the company&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>Multiple Chinese flying wing aircraft projects have been running for some time and are beginning to yield results, an anonymous military expert told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>The GJ-11, Sky Hawk and CH-7 are all flying wing stealth drones, but they focus on reconnaissance and attack, the expert said, noting that applying the technology on a transport plane will not be difficult.</p>
<p>Flying wing usually means the plane has lower drag force while flying and has more space within its cabins, giving the aircraft more load capacity, Ordnance Industry Science Technology said.</p>
<p>The FL-2 can carry six tons of cargo, the report said.</p>
<p>Since the problem of flight control, one of the most challenging issues with a flying wing design, has been solved, this design has become a main concept for future large transport planes, it said, noting that the FL-2 could serve as an important technical demonstrator for China&#8217;s next generation transport plane.</p>

<p>Beijing will soon enforce new trash sorting rules that may call for fines of 200 yuan ($28.30) to individuals who refuse to properly dispose of their waste, while giving restaurants and hotels up to 5,000 yuan if they provide disposable products to customers.</p>
<p>According to a draft amendment to its trash management regulations released on the Beijing government&#8217;s website, residents will be required to sort their garbage and place it in specified collection containers or face a fine of up to 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Companies and organizations could be fined from 10,000 to 50,000 yuan if they fail to follow the new regulations, according to the draft. The draft requires residents to sort their garbage into four classifications &#8211; kitchen waste, recyclable waste, hazardous waste and residual waste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The draft requires restaurants, catering service providers and hotels not to automatically provide customers with disposable tableware or disposable household items, and can be fined from 1,000 to 5,000 yuan if they fail to follow the rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows that China is attempting to engineer a huge shift in how businesses and individuals deal with garbage,&#8221; said Liu Jianguo, a professor at the School of Environment of Tsinghua University.</p>
<p>Beijing started to promote garbage classification citywide around 2010, but lacked effective management and supervision, said Liu. &#8220;The draft amends the weak parts of the existing regulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new regulations will place new restrictions on food delivery and courier companies, showing that disposable products have become a serious environmental issue in China, Liu said.</p>
<p>Data analysis company Analysys International reported that China&#8217;s takeout food market will reach revenues of 195.29 billion yuan, up 35 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beijing&#8217;s move appears to be supported by most internet users, but many also question the government&#8217;s ability to effectively enforce the new regulations.</p>
<p>Shanghai was the first Chinese city to enforce new trash sorting rules on July 1. The city&#8217;s compliance rate of garbage classification in the residential areas has increased from 15 percent at the end of last year to 80 percent in the third quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>From January 1 to June 25, Shanghai&#8217;s urban management and law enforcement department carried out more than 13,900 law enforcement inspections, investigating 1,224 cases of violations and educating 13,739 people, the Xinhua News Agency reported on July 1.</p>
<p>A Shanghai citizen Lin Ting said she was told that spent batteries are harmful trash that is harmful to the environment and was fined 200 yuan. &#8220;After that experience, I understood the importance of the regulations and make sure I sort my trash right every time before I throw it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai government&#8217;s website, a hot pot restaurant was fined 10,000 yuan in September for failing to sort its trash.</p>
