<p>Lionel Messi playing for Barcelona claimed the 2019 Ballon d&#8217;Or here on Monday, making the record of winning the award for the sixth time. </p>
<p>Before the ceremony, both Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo had won the award for five times. </p>
<p>This time, Messi edged out Virgil Van Dijk, who helped Liverpool to win the title of the Champions League last season. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is 10 years since I won my first Ballon d&#8217;Or here in Paris and I remember coming here with my three brothers, I was 22 and it was all unthinkable for me what I was going through,&#8221; Messi said at the ceremony. </p>
<p>&#8220;Now 10 years on this is my sixth, in a very different time, very special in my personal life with my wife and three children.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware of the age I have but I hope I have several years left to keep enjoying my football and doing this.&#8221; Messi added. </p>

<p>The Argentine had won the FIFA Men&#8217;s Player of the Year award in September, and he was the top scorer in the Champions League last season with 12 goals before Barcelona were beaten by Liverpool in the semifinals. </p>
<p>The 32-year-old striker also won the European Golden Shoe after scoring 36 goals, claimed La Liga title with Barcelona, and helped Argentina to get bronze at 2019 Copa America. </p>
<p>Juventus&#8217; forward Cristiano Ronaldo had also been shortlisted for the award, but did not attend the ceremony. </p>
<p>Megan Rapinoe won the Ballon d&#8217;Or for the best female player of the year. She led the United States to win the World Cup in France in July. </p>
<p>The 34-year-old Rapinoe also won the FIFA Women&#8217;s Player of the Year award, and she won the Golden Boot for being top scorer and the Golden Ball for the best player at the World Cup. </p>
<p>Dutch Matthijs de Ligt, who played as a defender for Serie A club Juventus and the Netherlands national team, won Kopa Trophy, the award presented to the best player under the age of 21. </p>
<p>Brazilian Alisson Becker, goalkeeper of Liverpool, won Yashin Trophy, which presented for the first time to the best goalkeeper of the year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chances of a joint British and Irish bid to host the 2030 World Cup have grown after officials agreed to ramp up preparations, according to the general manager of the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).</p>
<p>The English FA, which has been leading a feasibility study, presented the findings to other associations at a meeting before the Euro 2020 draw on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The feasibility study is positive and there&#8217;s a sense that the right thing to do is go forward,&#8221; FAI general manager Noel Mooney told The Times. &#8220;This bid is out on the front foot and very well led by the guys from the English FA who gave a very strong presentation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Times reported the joint bid would have matches played in several English cities, alongside Cardiff, Glasgow and Dublin, with the final to be staged at London&#8217;s Wembley Stadium.</p>
<p>The funding body UK Sport, which advises the government on which bids to support, said last year that hosting the 2030 World Cup in Britain would be a &#8220;crowning achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay have announced a four-way bid which could have sentimental value as Uruguay hosted the inaugural World Cup in 1930.</p>
<p>China would be among the contenders if FIFA decides to change the rules on how the World Cup is rotated between regions.</p>
<p>Asian countries are ruled out from hosting in 2030 because Qatar will stage the 2022 World Cup and current regulations prevent the same region from hosting either of the subsequent two tournaments.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi delivered a major boost to Barcelona&#8217;s La Liga title hopes by scoring a late winner in a 1-0 victory at Atletico Madrid on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;In matches that are close and intense, having Leo is always a big advantage,&#8221; said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde.</p>
<p>The Argentinian&#8217;s 86th-minute strike, after a neat one-two with Luis Suarez, keeps Barcelona level on points with Real Madrid at the top of the table while leaving Atletico with a mountain to climb if they are to rejoin the race.</p>
<p>Atletico now sit six points adrift of both Real and Barca, with those two also having a game in hand which will be played out in the season&#8217;s first Clasico at the Camp Nou on December 18.</p>
<p>It means Atleti could conceivably head into the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> break nine points off the lead, a significant gap, particularly considering they will have to play away against both Barca and Real Madrid in the second half of the season.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need points,&#8221; said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. &#8220;We are not far from them but we are worried. I am happy with the way we are playing but I will not smile at that because that does not bring us points.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antoine Griezmann was whistled on his return to his former club, whom he left for 120 million euros ($132.3 million) to join Barcelona in the close season, while toy rats were dropped on the plaque that still bears his name outside the stadium.</p>
<p>But Messi scored his 12th goal of the season and sixth in his last five games. He has now 25 in 27 in the league against Atletico although this was his first at the Wanda Metropolitano.</p>
<p>Barcelona were fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men in the second half when Gerard Pique escaped a second yellow card for a late challenge on Alvaro Morata.</p>
<p>They rode their luck in the opening 20 minutes too, marooned in their own half and able only to survive thanks in large part to their goalkeeper.</p>
<p>Marc-Andre ter Stegen made two excellent point-blank saves although was given the chance to as Mario Hermoso found himself free at the back post but shot straight at him before Morata met Kieran Trippier&#8217;s corner but failed to head into the corner.</p>
<p>There had been little Ter Stegen could do about Hermoso hitting the post early on as his pullback was diverted almost disastrously by Barca left-back Junior Firpo but somehow stayed out.</p>
<p>Earlier, third-placed Sevilla stayed just one point behind Real and Barca with a 1-0 victory over Leganes. Julen Lopetegui&#8217;s side extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 10 matches as Brazilian centerback Diego Carlos bundled in a 63rd-minute winner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liverpool opened up an 11-point gap at the top of the Premier League on Saturday when the old adage that title winners churn out victories even when not at their best had a special ring.</p>
<p>A couple of hours after champions Manchester City dropped two points at Newcastle United in a 2-2 draw, Liverpool scraped out a 2-1 win over Brighton and Hove Albion despite having goalkeeper Alisson red-carded.</p>
<p>It took Juergen Klopp&#8217;s relentless leaders to 40 points from 14 games after 13 wins and a draw with City on 29, the same as Leicester City who host Everton on Sunday.</p>
<p>Chelsea&#8217;s grip on fourth place suddenly looks a little less tight as they suffered a first home defeat by West Ham United for seven years, Aaron Cresswell&#8217;s goal sealing a 1-0 win for the Hammers who had lost five of their last six games.</p>
<p>Frank Lampard&#8217;s side have 26&nbsp;points, six ahead of Jose Mourinho&#8217;s resurgent Tottenham Hotspur who claimed successive league wins for the first time since April as they beat Bournemouth 3-2 with Dele Alli twice on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>All was calm at Anfield when Dutch central defender Virgil van Dijk scored two first-half headers against Brighton, but the second 45 minutes was anything but comfortable.</p>
<p>Brighton had shown some threat and when Alisson rushed out of his goal in the 76nd minute and blatanly handled there was no option but to send him off &#8211; a rush of blood that will rule him out of the Merseyside derby.</p>
<p>The immediate problem for Liverpool was that Lewis Dunk&#8217;s cheeky free kick beat sub keeper Adrian, prompting panic in the home ranks that Brighton looked capable of exploiting.</p>
<p>Liverpool hung on but were breathing a sigh of relief at the final whistle as Klopp&#8217;s side stretched the club&#8217;s unbeaten league run to 31.</p>
<p>City have now won only once in their last five games in all competitions and will be kicking themselves after twice leading at struggling Newcastle.</p>
<p>Raheem Sterling&#8217;s 22nd-minute strike was quickly cancelled out by Jetro Willems but when Kevin de Bruyne&#8217;s sledgehammer shot restored their lead late on it seemed the points were in the bag before Liverpool player Jonjo Shelvey&#8217;s superb curling effort left them frustrated.</p>

<p>Fabio Cannavaro took Guangzhou Evergrande to their eighth Chinese Super League (CSL) ­title on Sunday, a month after the Italian coach was publicly lambasted by the club for his &#8220;weak ability to rectify mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the championship going down to the final day of the season, Beijing Guoan needed to defeat Shandong Luneng at home and hope that Cannavaro&#8217;s side lost to visiting Shanghai Shenhua. Guoan triumphed 3-2 thanks to a 91st-minute goal but Evergrande were comfortable 3-0 winners over struggling Shenhua.</p>
<p>It is the first major honor of his coaching career and a personal triumph for Cannavaro, 46, who appeared to be on the brink of the sack just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Evergrande were then top of the CSL but in the middle of a slump and club bosses put veteran captain Zheng Zhi in temporary charge, telling Cannavaro to attend &#8220;corporate culture training.&#8221; The former Juventus defender and 2006 World Cup winner was retained as coach in early November but with a warning that he must &#8220;raise the players&#8217; overall fighting ability to win the Chinese Super League.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evergrande duly won their next two matches, notably against outgoing champions Shanghai SIPG, to put them on the brink of the title.</p>
<p>Evergrande topped the final CSL table with 72 points, ahead of Guoan with 70. SIPG were third on 66.</p>
<p>Former West Ham United striker Marko Arnautovic scored four for SIPG in a 6-0 thrashing of Roberto Donadoni&#8217;s already relegated Shenzhen FC.</p>

<p>France face a major hurdle if they are to add the European Championship to their World Cup crown after coming out in the same Euro 2020 group as Germany and reigning ­European champions Portugal in Saturday&#8217;s draw in Bucharest.</p>
<p>Neither France nor Portugal were in Pot One for the 24-team competition being held in 12 cities across Europe, making them the dangerous teams to avoid for the top seeds.</p>
<p>In the event, they were all put together in a high-caliber Group F alongside Germany, who will play all their group games in Munich. That is where Joachim Loew&#8217;s team will face France in their first match on June 16 and then Portugal on June 20.</p>
<p>Group F will be completed by one of the winners of the playoffs to be played next March, leaving open several possibilities including Hungary, who will play two games in Budapest should they make it.</p>
<p>France beat Germany in the semifinals of<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/988590.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euro 2016</a> on home soil, before slumping in the final against Portugal.</p>
<p>With the four best third-placed sides all going through, it is very possible all three will progress to the last 16.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, England were drawn with Croatia and the Czech Republic in Group D, with Gareth Southgate&#8217;s team to play group games at Wembley, which will also host the semifinals and the July 12 final.</p>
<p>That group will be completed by the team to emerge victorious from Path C in the playoffs &#8211; either Serbia, Norway, Israel and Scotland. The latter have the added incentive of knowing they will play two games in Glasgow in the group stage should they qualify.</p>
<p>England faced the Czechs in qualifying, winning 5-0 at Wembley but suffering their only defeat of the campaign in Prague, losing 2-1 in October.</p>
<p>England will kick off at home to Croatia on June 14 in a repeat of the 2018 World Cup semifinal, which was won by the Croatians.</p>
<p>However, should England win their group they will have to play the Group F runners-up, setting up a possible clash with Germany, France or Portugal in the last 16.</p>
<p>Even if they win that, the draw is such that they could end up facing Spain in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Italy will face Turkey in Rome in the tournament&#8217;s opening game on June 12, with Switzerland and Euro 2016 semifinalists Wales also in that section, Group A.</p>
<p>Wales will play two matches in far-flung Baku, starting with Switzerland on June 13. They played there this month, and won, against Azerbaijan in a qualifier.</p>
<p>Spain will play Sweden and Poland as well as a playoff winner in Group E, with Luis Enrique&#8217;s team playing in Bilbao.</p>
<p>Finland will face two hosts, Denmark and Russia, as well as much-fancied Belgium in Group B at what will be their first Euro.</p>
<p>The Netherlands, on the rise after missing Euro 2016 and the last World Cup, face Ukraine and Austria along with another play-off winner in Group C.</p>

<p>Leon Bailey scored twice as Bayern Munich crashed 2-1 at home to 10-man Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, while RB Leipzig top the Bundesliga after a nervous 3-2 win at bottom side&nbsp;Paderborn.</p>
<p>Hansi Flick lost for the first time in five games as Bayern&#8217;s interim coach after Jamaica winger Bailey scored first-half goals for Leverkusen.</p>
<p>Mid-table Leverkusen finished with 10 men ­after defender Jonathan Tah saw a late red card for fouling Philippe Coutinho.</p>
<p>Leipzig&#8217;s win over Paderborn allowed them to open a two-point lead over Borussia Moenchenglabach.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Jurgen Klinsmann started his tenure as Hertha Berlin&#8217;s interim boss with a 2-1 home defeat to 10-man Borussia Dortmund at the sold-out Olympic Stadium.</p>
<p>Flick, put in charge until at least January, had won his first four games with 16 goals scored and zero conceded &#8211; the best start by a coach in Bayern&#8217;s proud history.</p>
<p>However, little went right at the Allianz Arena for Bayern, who are fourth and trail Leipzig by three points.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t flip out after winning four games and I won&#8217;t now,&#8221; said Flick.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew Leverkusen were good on the ­counter and they took their chances mercilessly; we didn&#8217;t take ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bayern hit the woodwork three times, had 75 percent possession and 24 shots on goal, twice as many as Leverkusen.</p>
<p>The visitors were ahead on 10 minutes as Bailey glided past Benjamin Pavard after a brilliant&nbsp;Kevin Volland pass.</p>
<p>After Serge Gnabry, then Ivan Perisic had hit the woodwork, Thomas Mueller equalised on 33 minutes, but Bayern were level for just 113 seconds as Bailey this time motored past Javi Martinez to beat Manuel Neuer.</p>
<p>Bayern had little luck and even Robert Lewandowski, who scored four goals in 15 minutes in Tuesday&#8217;s 6-0 thrashing of Red Star Belgrade, failed to score.</p>
<p>Lewandowski fired wide, an unusual sight for the Poland star who has 27 goals in 21 games, then he hit the post in added time as Munich suffered only their second home defeat this season.</p>
<p>In Paderborn, Leipzig romped to a 3-0 halftime lead thanks to goals by Patrik Schick, Marcel Sabitzer and Germany striker Timo Werner, who netted his 13th league goal this season.</p>
<p>However, it was a completely different story ­after the break.</p>
<p>Paderborn, who earned a 3-3 draw at Dortmund last weekend, roared back with goals by ­striker Streli Mamba and captain Klaus Gjasula, but Leipzig held on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made it more tense than necessary,&#8221; admitted Leipzig sports director Markus Kroesche.</p>
<p>In the capital, ex-Germany and USA head coach Klinsmann saw his Hertha team lose despite Dortmund playing the entire second-half with 10 men after Mats Hummels was sent off.</p>
<p>Dortmund are fifth &#8211; four points behind Leipzig &#8211; with their win easing the pressure on coach Lucien Favre.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>West Brom moved back to the top of the Championship with a thumping 4-1 ­victory over Bristol City at The Hawthorns.</p>
<p>Leeds had gone top with victory at Reading on Tuesday, but Slaven Bilic&#8217;s men restored their two-point lead in style.</p>
<p>Grady Diangana was the key man for the Baggies, setting up Kieran Gibbs to open the scoring on 10 minutes with a smart backheel and then being brought down on the edge of the area five minutes from halftime.</p>
<p>Matheus Pereira took full advantage of the dangerous position to curl a left-footed free kick over the wall and into the top corner.</p>
<p>Famara Diedhiou pulled a goal back for the visitors 10 minutes from time, but Hal Robson-Kanu made it 3-1 just two minutes later and substitute Charlie Austin completed the scoring in the 87th minute.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest moved up to fourth in the table with a 4-0 win at Queens Park Rangers, who had Lee ­Wallace sent off early in the second&nbsp;half.</p>
<p>Tobias Figueiredo headed Forest in front after 15 minutes and the home side had a mountain to climb when Wallace was shown a straight red card for bringing down Joe Lolley.</p>
<p>It took until the 82nd minute for Lewis Grabban to double his side&#8217;s lead and further late goals from Joao Carvalho and Alfa Semedo completed a miserable evening for QPR.</p>
<p>At the other end of the table, Middlesbrough moved out of the relegation zone with a 1-0 win over bottom side Barnsley at the Riverside.</p>
<p>Ashley Fletcher scored the only goal of the game for Jonathan Woodgate&#8217;s side to leave Barnsley eight points adrift of safety.</p>
<p>Bradley Dack&#8217;s 11th-minute goal was enough for Blackburn to get the better of Brentford at Ewood Park.</p>
<p>Hull thrashed Preston 4-0 thanks to two goals from Jarrod Bowen.</p>
<p>Sheffield Wednesday and Birmingham had to settle for a point apiece at Hillsborough, where Kadeem Harris struck in the 81st minute to cancel out Alvaro Gimenez&#8217;s opener for the visitors.</p>

<p>A brace from Lautaro Martinez and a Romelu Lukaku goal handed Inter Milan a 3-1 win at Slavia Prague on Wednesday, keeping the Italians in contention for the Champions League last 16.</p>
<p>Inter are level with Borussia Dortmund on seven points each in Group F topped by Barcelona who clinched a last-16 spot after beating the Germans 3-1 at the Camp Nou.</p>
<p>&#8220;The win is important for us, we had no choice but to win,&#8221; said Inter coach Antonio Conte.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew what to expect, the forward duo were decisive and I&#8217;m very happy for them,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In the last round of games on December 10, Inter face Barcelona at the San Siro while Dortmund host Slavia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We gave meaning to this match against Barca by winning,&#8221; said Conte. &#8220;We are expecting a great match, hard, but we know that we can count on 80,000 people who will come to the stadium to push us. That was what we wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martinez opened the scoring on 19 minutes after Lukaku had picked up a pass, fought off two challenges and took the ball into the box before cutting it back to the unmarked Argentinian.</p>
<p>Martinez scored for the fourth consecutive Champions League game for Inter.</p>
<p>Tomas Soucek levelled for Slavia from the penalty spot in the 37th minute after Stefan de Vrij had brought down striker Peter Olayinka in the box.</p>
<p>Polish referee Szymon Marciniak first ignored the foul and let play continue with Lukaku scoring on the counterattack before seeing his goal chalked off as the video referee took centre stage.</p>
<p>Lukaku added Inter&#8217;s second nine minutes from the end after Slavia&#8217;s last man Michal Frydrych slipped and let him round keeper Ondrej Kolar.</p>
<p>Martinez then volleyed home his second as Lukaku robbed the Slavia defence and provided him with a superb cross in the 88th minute.</p>
<p>Outside of the four goals, Slavia had the first sight of the target on five minutes when Josef Husbauer narrowly missed with a header.</p>
<p>Inter&#8217;s first shot came from Martinez whose low shot across the goal narrowly went the wrong side of Kolar&#8217;s left post.</p>
<p>After Inter&#8217;s opener, Slavia put the Nerazzurri under pressure, but Frydrych headed wide and Lukas Masopust just missed the top left corner of Samir Handanovic&#8217;s goal.</p>
<p>Inter were on the front foot early into the second half, but they failed to produce a decent chance at first.</p>
<p>On the other side, Handanovic had a hard time clearing a deflected Masopust shot over the crossbar and Slavia&#8217;s second-half substitute Ibrahim Traore missed narrowly.</p>
<p>Moments later, Lukaku sent his header onto the crossbar and Marcelo Brozovic then followed suit with a volley halfway into the second half.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Masopust intercepted a pass and sprinted down the centre but failed to beat Handanovic one-on-one.</p>

<p>The Belgium football authority is eyeing to win the European Championship next year, as the team maintained their strong position as the world No.1 since October 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;Winning it [the European ­Championship] is not going to be an easy task, but with the players that we have right now, it&#8217;s our ambition to go as far as possible,&#8221; Manu Leroy, ­Director of Marketing of Royal Belgian Football Association (RBFA), told the Global Times in a recent interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is probably more difficult than to win a World Cup, it&#8217;s the tournament that is with all the best teams in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Belgium national football team has qualified for the 2020 UEFA European Championship with the maximum ranking points, by winning all games in the qualifying stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boasting several international stars including Eden Hazard, Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, Belgium is considered one of the most daunting sides in football. But they haven&#8217;t won any titles since 1920, when Belgians won the football title at the 1920 Antwerp Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe winning a gold medal [at the European Championship] would be fantastic … The generation has been quite successful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would be really great in 2020 like 100 years later to win again, the silverware will be fantastic.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent success of Belgium football was in 2018, when they reached the semifinals of the FIFA World Cup in Russia, losing to the ultimate winners France.</p>
<p>Instead of traditionally hosting the European Championship in a single country, the 2020 edition will be held across 12 cities of 11 countries in ­Europe, as the event marks the 60th anniversary of the championship. That allows every team to travel to more places and influence more people to enjoy football.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Deeper engagement with China</span></strong></p>
<p>Belgium is also looking for a better engagement with the development of Chinese football.</p>
<p>&#8220;As China needs to develop players and coaches, Belgium can bring a lot of knowledge to China,&#8221; Leroy told the Global Times. &#8220;We are very open to discussions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a direct link in terms of youth development [between China and Belgium] and we have some specialists in Belgium. We have a couple of good academies at the club level, but we also have people who have worked a lot training coaches.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RBFA has also penned a deal with Lagardere Sports to promote its presence in China this year, both online and offline.</p>
<p>Li Ying, Managing Director of the Greater China region for Lagardere Sports, said Belgium football has the potential to be more influential thanks to its stars&#8217; popularity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike the European giants France, Germany, Italy and England whose reputations are already well ­established as a team in China, ­Belgium players&#8217; individual reputations among the young Chinese fans are very strong,&#8221; Li told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a bright future in this and Belgian football will increase its influence in China.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three Belgian stars are playing in the Chinese Super League, with Yannick Carrasco at Dalian Yifang, Mousa Dembélé at Guangzhou R&amp;F and Marouane Fellaini of Shandong Luneng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belgium internationals Hazard of Real Madrid and De Bruyne of Manchester City have social media accounts on China&#8217;s Twitter-like ­platform Weibo, with their fans numbering in the millions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px"><strong>Manu Leroy Photo: IC</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Embedded in culture</strong></span></p>
<p>For a long time, some Chinese parents considered football, or sports in general, as dangerous to their kids, as they may pose a &#8220;threat&#8221; to the children&#8217;s safety. Leroy warned that Chinese parents should change their mind-set, as it is not only beneficial to the children&#8217;s physique but also their mentality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;You have to work with your body, but you also need to work with your head,&#8221; Leroy told the Global Times. &#8220;Injuries are not inevitable. Children are able to play smartly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In every school that you go through in Belgium, children are playing football, though not necessarily on grass or a big pitch,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;Sports is also embedded in the curriculum at school.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belgium has between 500,000 to 600,000 registered players, which means every local village is likely to have a football club, as the club number has reached 6,000, Leroy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of incentives to do sports and football. Belgium has the mentality to do a lot of sports.&#8221;</p>
