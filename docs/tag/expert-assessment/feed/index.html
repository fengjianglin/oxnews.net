<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT</p>
<p>The Chinese economy continues to slow down as it faces multiple pressures in 2019, but it is also showing resilience with the support of a complex set of stabilizing policies. Economic growth has remained in a rational and controllable range this year. 2020 will be a crucial year for China to secure a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, but the country will face greater challenges, particularly in the following six aspects.</p>
<p>First, external challenges will be more demanding. The global economic downturn and great-power competition have entered new phases, bringing about unprecedented uncertainty to global economic policies. This will not only directly impact China through trade, but it will also negatively influence the open economy by undermining market confidence. In 2020, external demand is expected to continue weakening, the global manufacturing industry is set to slump, China-US strategic competition will enter a new stage, and the 2020<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/US-election-2016/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US election</a> will bring further uncertainty to the prolonged trade war between the two countries.</p>
<p>Second, domestic demand is expected to remain weak and may accelerate the economic slowdown. China&#8217;s net exports have seen rapid growth this year, but domestic demand has experienced a significant decline. The economy is therefore more vulnerable and reliant on external demand, particularly when enterprises don&#8217;t expand their investment in production and residents don&#8217;t increase their consumption of durable goods. In the short term, China needs to stabilize foreign trade. The global economic slowdown will make it harder for China to maintain the rapid growth of net exports in 2020, and China must implement more targeted measures to boost domestic demand. More importantly, the decline in production investment does not just concern numbers, but also efficiency.</p>
<p>Third, the slowdown of economic growth may aggravate the current conditions of weak sectors and regions. As pressures mount for small and medium-sized enterprises, local financial risks may worsen. Changing economic structures in some regions may cause unemployment risks. In 2020, enterprises in eastern regions will find it difficult to turn a profit, and those in central regions should expect to see a further slowdown in the growth of revenue. Thus, employment will be at risk in certain regions and sectors. The automobile and mobile phone industries are still in steep decline. The real-estate, construction and information services industries have also contracted significantly. Downward sales and production in these industries mean that they face greater pressure when it comes to employment.</p>
<p>Fourth, the risk of a new round of deflation in the Chinese economy will increase in 2020, which deserves attention and requires preparation. Although the price of food &#8211; represented by pork &#8211; has risen sharply since the third quarter, driving the consumer price index (CPI) higher, this doesn&#8217;t mean that deflation will not occur next year. Instead, the continued falls of the non-food CPI, producer price index (<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/957593.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PPI</a>) and GDP deflator are highly similar to the initial performances of previous rounds of deflation. PPI trends from the fourth to the second quarter next year will need to be watched closely. Meanwhile, monetary policy needs to remain prudent.</p>
<p>Fifth, China should be wary of the risks that come with a structural rise in food prices &#8211; including pork &#8211; and weak overall demand. The prices of pork and other foods will continue to rise next year, leading to negative expectations in the market. Meanwhile, overall domestic demand will remain weak. These two factors are expected to have short-term impacts on the economy, causing severe problems for its macro-management in 2020.</p>
<p>Sixth, mitigated financial risks may recur in 2020. Although the financial sector is clearly moving to provide more support for the real economy, pressure from a poor monetary transmission mechanism still exists. And though financial risks have been mitigated this year, defaults will persist in the future. Particularly alongside the continued economic downturn, financial risks may appear repeatedly. Financial-risk mitigation and prevention will be the core focuses of macro-management next year.</p>

<p>As China-Africa economic and trade cooperation increases alongside the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, more Chinese companies are eager to jump into the African market, hoping to expand their market share and development space. Data shows that more than 3,000 Chinese companies are currently doing business in Africa, and their employees and projects are spreading through every country on the continent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the public image of Chinese companies operating in Africa has become increasingly complicated. The Chinese government and Chinese firms have long believed that the investment, construction and operation of these firms in Africa would greatly improve the living standards of African people. However, Chinese companies have been painted in a negative light by local media. They are portrayed to be selling low quality products and services, lacking in social responsibility, offering low salaries and disrespecting African employees. Some Western media have even described China as &#8220;neocolonialist&#8221; or a &#8220;rogue donor.&#8221;</p>
<p>This image results from the bias of Western countries which aim to gain a competitive advantage on the continent. In addition to international competition, Chinese companies cannot ignore the issue of how to build positive communication and a cooperative relationship with local media and people in Africa, thereby improving their public image. Against the backdrop of rising global protectionism and the US&#8217; perceived rivalry with China in Africa, Chinese companies need to work on their public image if they want to succeed amid the fierce competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese companies should pay more attention to mobilizing non-governmental organizations (NGOs). NGOs in African countries are well-developed, and each country has hundreds or thousands of them. They are deep-rooted and each has its own specialty. Together, they reflect local public opinions and demand. For these reasons, global development organizations pay great attention to them. For project conductors from developed countries, or independent aid recipients, local NGOs are important development cooperation partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Chinese companies tend to overlook the importance of local NGOs. For instance, the Zambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry is an organization that was founded to provide consultation and public relations services for companies doing business in Zambia. Hundreds of foreign-owned companies in Zambia are members, but no Chinese firms have joined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese companies should be advised to devote capital and non-capital support to local NGOs, using the expertise of local organizations to spruce up their own public image. They could fund NGOs which have independent goals, supporting their training and forums to enhance cooperation. Such NGOs possess relevant skills and knowledge in professional areas, and have established relationships with local people and organizations. Chinese companies could use NGOs to repair their negative local perception. These firms should also increase and strengthen systemic conversation and consultation or they should implement regular consultation mechanisms, and coordinate with African NGOs flexibly and professionally.</p>
<p>In addition to working with NGOs, Chinese companies can request help from local media and public relations agencies. The internet industry in Africa has developed rapidly, and burgeoning new media technologies now influence African people&#8217;s lives. Chinese companies, which lack engagement with those agencies, can utilize multiple platforms to close the gap between their operations and African people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies should first update their official websites, presenting examples of their social undertakings and responsibility through pictures and videos. Over the years, Chinese firms have made efforts to improve local welfare, giving back to African society. Many enterprises have built public facilities including schools and hospitals without publicizing their work. It is difficult for local people to realize that Chinese companies were involved in such projects.</p>
<p>Companies should also establish overseas social media accounts and contract local public relations services to operate and maintain them.</p>
<p>Chinese companies provided emergency aid during Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique in March, in concert with humanitarian aid provided by the Chinese government. This did not draw a great deal of local attention. The professional advantages of utilizing local media and public relations agencies could have helped build a more positive public image at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With protectionism and unilateralism worldwide, Chinese companies face tough competition. To continue the golden age of China-Africa economic cooperation, Chinese companies have to boost their competitiveness and form a healthy public image. It is only then that local people will realize Chinese companies are not moving to Africa to plunder it, but to make contributions to the continent and its people&#8217;s lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></p>
<p>An article calling to prevent economic growth from sliding below 6 percent has sparked debate among Chinese economists. The piece was published by Yu Yongding, an academician and senior fellow of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. With a gloomy world economic landscape and uncertainties brought about by the China-US trade war, the Chinese economy &#8211;&nbsp; with a 6 to 6.5 percent growth goal &#8211;&nbsp; has been under pressure. An ebbing economic growth and rising consumer price index have placed policymakers in a dilemma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Economists are debating whether to defend a 6 percent growth rate with a stimulus package or apply more reform measures to the Chinese economy, which would stabilize growth at 5 percent. The side of the debate which Yu belongs to believes China&#8217;s current priority should be maintaining a 6 percent growth rate with an expansionary fiscal policy and loose monetary policy. The other side argues that it is time for China to switch gears, focusing on long-term reform and changing the economic structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Han Yongwen, deputy director of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges</strong></p>
<p>The real pressure for economic growth is employment, and maintaining a 6 percent economic growth is vital. China&#8217;s economic development has suffered from increasing downward pressure since last year. Next year, multiple pressures will mount. Therefore, stable economic growth carries more significance. If the growth rate can be stabilized next year &#8211; after speeding up the pace of reforms and adjustment &#8211; the Chinese economy will enter a level period, and maintaining this will be the key to economic development.</p>
<p>The state of employment will be the real pressure on next year&#8217;s economic growth. Data shows that the number of college graduates will reach 8.7 million next year. Add that figure to recent graduates who have not yet secured jobs and a huge amount of job vacancies will be needed to absorb the excess labor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Liu Shijin, deputy head of the economic committee of the 13th Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference National Committee</p>
<p></strong>There are two basic facts that people should realize about the Chinese economy. The first is that the transfer from high-speed growth to the gradual decline was due to a shift in economic growth phases &#8211; from 10 percent high-speed growth to 5 percent medium-speed growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second basic fact is that monetary and fiscal policies will not change the potential growth rate. There have been voices calling for looser monetary policy. In fact, monetary policy has already become relatively loose in recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the current macroeconomic policy is relatively loose, adopting a stimulus policy or trying to beat the potential growth rate is like advance spending. Economic stimulus could trigger a steep drop, and China should be particularly wary of this possible outcome.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy has entered a medium-speed growth phase, which has a 5 to 6 percent GDP growth rate but it has not been stabilized. It could still fall by 1 percentage point in the next year or two. The pressure to maintain stable economic growth will be greater next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Old driving forces for growth &#8211; infrastructure, real estate and exports &#8211; have been lacking momentum. The Chinese economy has to look for new potential thrusts for medium-speed growth if it wants to prevent a drop below 5 percent. Therefore, next year&#8217;s focus should be on reforms and policy adjustment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shen Jianguang, chief economist of JD Finance</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintaining growth at 6 percent should not be China&#8217;s goal in 2020. The country has already adopted some stimulus measures, but the results have been insignificant. Policymakers have paid great attention to maintaining stable economic growth amid the current economic downturn, and have been utilizing countercyclical adjustment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite this, Chinese economic data still appears weak. But does that mean China&#8217;s stimulus was ineffective? This is not the case. Without these policies, China&#8217;s economic growth could have already dropped below 6 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the external environment deteriorates beyond expectations, maintaining a 6 percent economic growth will not only be difficult, but unnecessary. China needs to deepen its reform and opening-up, avoiding the use of strong stimulus.</p>
<p>Next year will be an important year for reform. It will be difficult to maintain short-term, stable growth and promote long-term reform simultaneously. If reforms obtain substantial results, together with medium and long-term benefits &#8211; even if economic growth declines to 5 percent &#8211; it will be better than 6 percent achieved through heavy stimulus.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong></p>
<p>Amid the slowing global economy, the bruising China-US trade war and the decline in internal demand, China&#8217;s economy in 2019 has continued the weak trend seen since 2018, and this is expected to continue in 2020. In the year that China aims to secure the victory of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, how will the country deal with the negative factors and maintain growth? Here is some advice from Chinese economists:</p>
<p><strong>Liu Yuanchun, vice president of Renmin University of China</strong></p>
<p>A growth range of 5.5-6 percent would be an appropriate goal for China in 2020. A conservative estimate for the whole year would be around 5.8 percent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to have a medium-term perspective and managed expectations when developing macro policies. Both policy makers and market players should have a forward-looking perspective.</p>
<p>The principles emphasized at the fourth plenary session of the 19th Communist Party of China Central Committee should be implemented. A new round of comprehensive reforms and opening-up should be carried out. By deepening supply side reforms, structural and systemic issues at deeper levels can be resolved.</p>
<p>M2 growth in 2020 should be higher than nominal GDP growth. The total private financing growth should not be reduced too quickly. A growth rate of around 11 percent is in accordance with appropriate financial rectification and restrictions.</p>
<p>Fiscal policies should be more positive and more targeted. The fiscal deficit rate should be kept above 3 percent in 2020. More tax cuts and fee reductions should be carried out, not just in production, but also in consumption and distribution of income.</p>
<p>In order to maintain investment, policy tools and direction need significant adjustments. The crucial role of investment should be fully utilized in optimizing supply side reform.</p>
<p>Policies to secure and improve people&#8217;s wellbeing should be put in a fundamental position. The fact that people&#8217;s wellbeing may be affected by external factors and pressure from the economic slowdown deserves more attention.</p>
<p>China should positively cope with the China-US trade war, and rethink the strategic choices during a restructuring period for the world&#8217;s order. The global industry chain, supply chain and value chain are facing changes and China needs to make new plans with a forward-looking and broad perspective. Attention should also be paid to potential US strategies such as some kind of &#8220;Economic Iron Curtain&#8221; or a &#8220;New Cold War.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Lian Ping, chief economist at the Bank of Communications</strong></p>
<p>In order to better guide market expectations, maintain market confidence and develop positive and achievable goals for relevant sectors, China should set an economic growth goal for 2020 of around 6 percent.</p>
<p>More positive fiscal policies need to be introduced in 2020 to strengthen countercyclical adjustments and prevent a further slowdown in economic growth. The fiscal deficit rate can be raised to 3 percent or even higher. The size of local special bonds can be raised to more than 3 trillion yuan, and the issuance time could be advanced to the beginning of the year. The utilization areas should also be expanded to increase the fiscal resources of local governments and help stabilize growth.</p>
<p>Monetary policies for countercyclical adjustments need to focus on increasing credit. By increasing credit, policies&#8217; margin effects will be improved. Specifically, China could tighten regulations on banking risk management, providing rational targeted liquidity to commercial banks and improving their willingness and capacity to give loans.</p>
<p>Stabilized yuan exchange rate and cross-border capital flows should be maintained. First, prudent restrictions should be maintained, preventing continuous capital outflows. Second, the convertibility capacity of yuan capital items and steady expansion of bond and stock market openness so as to attract cross-border capital inflows should be prudently and gradually promoted. Third, the management of foreign exchange for corporate and personal investments should be strengthened and the management of personal foreign exchange purchase quotas should be maintained. Fourth, market expectations should be reasonably guided. China should increase policy transparency, reduce the disturbance of irrational expectations amid asymmetric information, and pursue timely and reasonable intervention in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>The real estate policy should basically meet the reasonable housing demand of residents. The policy should adhere to the general tone of &#8220;do not speculate in housing&#8221; and should adopt different measures in accordance with specific cities.</p>
<p>A balance between supply and demand in the pork market should be found, to prevent pork prices from rising continuously.</p>
<p><strong>Liu Rui, professor with the School of Applied Economics, Renmin University of China</strong></p>
<p>It would be appropriate for China to set its economic growth goal at around 6 percent for 2020. In general, stability is still the key for China&#8217;s macroeconomic policies. China should promote structural adjustments, such as giving better support for emerging industries and deepening reform in these sectors.</p>
<p>The China-US trade war remains a source of significant uncertainty for China&#8217;s economy in the next year. China should also prepare for a potential worsening of the situation. However, the worst impacts from the trade war have probably passed. Companies that depended on exports to the US have taken measures and finished adjustments. No great impacts are expected in 2020.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial for China to achieve better progress in supply side structural reform, which will hedge against downward pressure on traditional industries and business models.</p>
<p>New policy goals need to be made for structural reform in traditional sectors, because the first phase, involving targets such as reducing capacity, has finished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More significance should be attached to the manufacturing sector. The services sector has been benefiting from greater consumption, but the improvements should not just be in quantity and growth, but also in transformation of the consumption model and methods.</p>
<p>Fiscal policies should be more positive. The fiscal deficit rate should be allowed to reach or just exceed 3 percent. Meanwhile, stimulus should not be flood-like. Projects requiring more investment need to be considered but should also be controlled.</p>
<p>Monetary policy should be locked to the target of stabilizing the financial market and preventing more financial risks. Systemic financial risks deserve a high degree of caution.<br />

<p>Should China again call to &#8220;make every endeavor to promote exports?&#8221; The answer is most certainly yes. Based on current and upcoming domestic and global economic conditions, it&#8217;s necessary for China to re-emphasize exports, particularly for its high-tech industries. As the world is expected to enter a long low-growth period given the uncertainties that come with long-term trade friction, stabilizing and expanding exports has become the priority of trade policies and will be crucial when it comes to combating external impacts.</p>
<p>In November, the manufacturing purchasing managers&#8217; index (PMI) from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) jumped back above the 50 mark which separates contraction from growth, reversing the May-October downward trend. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the pressure on China&#8217;s economy has been relieved entirely. China should remain prepared for a prolonged fight against pressure from the slowdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s macroeconomic policies to boost growth should focus on more positive fiscal policies and measures to expand exports. Positive fiscal policies can boost the fiscal deficit and debt. For emerging economies, a large fiscal deficit and current account deficit often mean a potential financial crisis. Alongside China&#8217;s positive expansion of its opening-up and imports, the country also needs to expand exports significantly, avoiding large deficits.</p>
<p>High-tech and innovative industries are the pillars of China&#8217;s industrial upgrading and sustainable economic growth. They are also the focus of the bruising China-US trade war. China should focus on promoting its exports of high-tech products. The nation&#8217;s high-tech industries have seen great investment in fixed assets during an overall weak investment environment. If these high-tech industries encounter obstacles in sales and the supply of key parts, investments in the sector over recent years will become bad assets, impacting China&#8217;s financial system.</p>
<p>As China, South Korea and Western countries increase investment in high-tech industries, their economies are in fierce industry-development competition, leading to low capacity utilization in high-tech production. Domestic and overseas information and communications technology (ICT) industries in 2018 widely predicted that the global semiconductor market, among other industrial markets, could experience significant decline in 2019. Thus, a full crackdown on China&#8217;s high-tech industry will present an opportunity to amplify its competitiveness.</p>
<p>China, India and Japan made huge investments in the tea industry in the 1860s and 1870s. In the late 1870s, China lost its dominance in the international tea trade to India and Japan, devastating the economies of its southeastern provinces. China must make efforts to prevent a similar situation from occurring with high-tech industries.</p>
<p>As the domestic high-tech products market is approaching saturation, its focus should be on the promotion and expansion of overseas markets. This should be clear, particularly amid an overall atmosphere of promoting domestic consumption and exports.</p>
<p>Since last year, many overseas investors have presented shrunken market expectations for China&#8217;s economy. But, compared with the major impacts China&#8217;s economy has faced in the past, the current challenge is a much easier hurdle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China can achieve a better performance with every crisis it encounters by steadily promoting reform and improving its competitiveness. According to the economic development cycle, the global economy has reached a period of low growth which is expected to continue for about a decade. International trade frictions have aggravated the situation. But as long as China deepens economic reform and makes timely policy adjustments as it did when facing its previous challenges, the external impact can again be transformed into opportunity, helping China raise its international status again.</p>

<p>The US economy is performing steadily. The country&#8217;s production remains solid &#8211; especially in the technology sector &#8211; fortunes are gathering and asset prices are expected to continue rising. However, the real challenge facing the US economy today is wealth distribution. As the debt levels of all classes continue to mount, more money needs to be given to the country&#8217;s people in order to maintain the economic growth of consumption power.</p>
<p>The debt levels of US families and the country&#8217;s younger generations have seen significant growth despite tighter reins from the government. Allowances have been given to families for housing and decorating, and pension allowances have been given to seniors. But these measures have not proved effective &#8211; social dissatisfaction is evident, and the influence of populism has risen sharply.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump&#8217;s success in the 2016 election was only the beginning, and whether or not he can succeed in his re-election bid is now in question. The outcome of the 2020 presidential race, however, will barely influence the US&#8217; economic situation going forward. No matter who takes office, they will need to resolve the existing problems in the country&#8217;s wealth-distribution system, and the best solution to these problems is the promotion of reforms to provide universal healthcare.</p>
<p>Universal healthcare is important to the future US economy as it is not only critical for society and politics, but it will also have a broad influence on the nation&#8217;s economy and finance.</p>
<p>A closer look at the wealth structure of US families reveals that housing, commuting, food, insurance, pension and medical care account for majority of total expenditure &#8211; and the last three all relate to healthcare. That&#8217;s why universal healthcare is the priority when it comes to optimizing the wealth structure of US families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the insurance industry is a significant pillar of the US&#8217; financial sector. The healthcare issue has a direct influence on the insurance industry&#8217;s revenues, and may lead to major reform in the current financial system. That&#8217;s why Wall Street is closely following the Democratic performance in the 2020 election, given that it is the Democrats who are waving the universal healthcare banner.</p>
<p>Younger generations in the US, most obviously represented by university students, tend to support the Democratic stance on the healthcare issue. The US is one of the few major economies in the world that doesn&#8217;t have a system of universal healthcare, thus the trend is expected to eventually become a reality.</p>
<p>How will such a revolution influence US society, particularly in the long run? This is a question that needs to be answered prudently. The 2020 election may attract more attention to the issue. A universal healthcare system may be established if the Democrats take office. Such a change would have an impact on Wall Street, which may lead to the depreciation of the US dollar and instigate a buying frenzy for bonds. An infrastructure-construction boom may follow, and economic and industrial restructuring could be at its heels.</p>
<p>A significant reform like the introduction of universal healthcare may bring uncertainty to the US&#8217; society and industries. During the transformation, an economic crisis and financial crisis may take place, causing shocks to some extent. But the overall situation is not likely to be influenced because, for the US, it&#8217;s just a fortune-reallocation process &#8211; another boost to its consumption.</p>
<p>How would such a political process and reform take place in the US? Will the process cause a meltdown of the US economy, dragging down the US&#8217; global status? Analysis shows that it is more likely to go to in the opposite direction; the US could consolidate its current global position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the infrastructure boom could hedge the risks for Wall Street. This round of infrastructure construction will not be concerned with merely bridges and roads; it will be more technology-driven and include the construction of intelligent cities, healthcare benefits facilities, regional structure adjustments, and environmental investments and construction. Second, the introduction of universal healthcare will be a new round of wealth re-allocation, which will promote consumption, balance the investment-driven infrastructure boom and support the economy&#8217;s forward growth. Third, the US is a high-tech country; the realization of universal healthcare could be conducive to gathering more elite tech professionals so as to build up its edge in the global tech race.</p>

<p>Whether to let the so-called Xinjiang-related bill get in between the China-US trade talks is fundamentally up to China. The US is attempting to introduce everything that can disrupt China to be related to the China-US trade war. If China goes along with the US&#8217; moves, all issues will be entangled with each other and the trade war will become an endless problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US has interfered with Hong Kong affairs, now there&#8217;s the Xinjiang bill. Later, Taiwan-related issues could also be brought into the picture.</p>
<p>From this perspective, toppling Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are US strategic intentions. But it should be clear that these issues are not related with the trade war. Due to the ideological and value differences between the two countries, it is inevitable that members of the US Congress cook up these bills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the trade war is connected with all those political issues, the trade war will be upgraded to a major problem in China-US diplomatic ties. Then it will become boundless. China should draw a line somewhere, separating the trade war and diplomatic ties. Any trade agreement will be held up endlessly if the trade war is tied up with the so-called Xinjiang bill.</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-03/0a68c926-4b61-4135-bae7-f49663a9b9c5.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT</p>
<p>In order to promote quality economic growth, the Chinese central government has rolled out a series of policies including the Foreign Investment Law which will come into effect on January 1, 2020, 11 measures on financial reform and measures to promote the development of pilot free trade zones (FTZs). These policies have been well received by markets, will significantly improve the domestic business climate and will boost investor confidence.</p>
<p>However, good policies also need efficient and complete regulations to be effective. Whether or not good policies can be well implemented and produce good outcomes largely depends upon regulations. Frequently occurring failures in policy implementation have failed to honor the policies themselves and have caused damage to the central government&#8217;s credibility. The rights and interests of policy beneficiaries are largely infringed upon as well. Therefore, we should attach great importance to this issue and take measures to avoid failure in policy implementation.</p>
<p>When such failures and infringements happen in sectors that could damage the real economy, poverty alleviation efforts or the agricultural sector, it is even more important to take action. Infringements of farmers&#8217; contracting rights for rural land are typical examples. The central government has devised strict rules to regulate rural land transfers, but many local governments have neglected these rules and exploited lands without first attaining approval from farmers, infringing upon their legitimate rights and interests.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a large area of rural land that is contracted. As urbanization develops rapidly, a large number of farmers are working in urban areas, turning their contracted land into cash cows for illegal businessmen.</p>
<p>Failures of policy implementation are manifesting in three ways. First, good policies are changed and twisted when implemented, producing entirely unexpected outcomes. Second, when new policies are implemented, delays appear and beneficial opportunities are missed, which largely impacts planned effects. Third, when urgently needed policies come to the implementation stage, a lack of coordination and long-term plans means that current problems may be solved but more issues arise simultaneously.</p>
<p>There are three major reasons for failures in policy implementation. First, relevant departments and governments don&#8217;t attach enough importance to the policies that are made by the central government, and they make changes to certain rules. Second, some local governments put local interests above overall national interests. They take advantage of certain rules at the expense of national interests, purposefully failing to fully implement relevant policies. Third, some local governments and organizations operate against the original purpose of the rules. They seem to act in accordance with the rules, but privately infringe upon their credibility, causing the total failure of the policy implementation.</p>
<p>In order to completely rule out such failures, governments at all levels need to strengthen the study of policies made by the central government and learn their purposes. They also need to put the interests of the people first and improve governmental performance, so as to guarantee the full implementation of relevant policies.&nbsp;</p>
