<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Ge Fengjin, son of Ge Daorong, a survivor of the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1080223.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanjing Massacre</a>, held a testimony meeting here on Wednesday night to convey the truth about the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 and remind people to never forget history. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Ge Fengjin, son of Ge Daorong, a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, held a testimony meeting here on Wednesday night to convey the truth about the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 and remind people to never forget history.</p>
<p>At the invitation of a few local civil groups, Ge Fengjin shared his father&#8217;s story at the meeting to mark the 82nd anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre. About 100 people attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Ge Daorong, a survivor of the massacre, was only 10 years old when Nanjing fell to Japanese invaders. He survived by escaping into the Safety Zone during the mass killing, but his three uncles did not.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, he has devoted himself to sharing his story. As he gets older, his son has taken over.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Dec. 13, 1937, the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing and carried out the deadly Nanjing massacre, killing 300,000 of our compatriots, including my family members,&#8221; said Ge Fengjin.</p>
<p>As descendant of a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, he said he should not only remember the painful history, but also has the responsibility to tell the truth and testify to the the mass-killing, adding that he wants more young people to know and remember this part of history.</p>
<p>Sun Zhaiwei, an expert on the Nanjing Massacre and researcher at Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, delivered a speech themed &#8220;The solemn truth of Nanjing Defense Battle&#8221; at the meeting.</p>
<p>He introduced the historical background of the Nanjing Massacre, the historical truth of the Nanjing Defense Battle, from three aspects: &#8220;the capture of Nanjing is the established goal of the Japanese army,&#8221; &#8220;the heroic fight of Chinese soldiers&#8221; and &#8220;the important historical position of the battle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reviewing the truth of the battle is not to continue the hatred, Sun said, but to learn from the historical experience, be vigilant to the resurgence of Japanese militarism which has brought disasters to mankind, and work together to strive for and maintain lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Shota Naito, a postdoctoral fellow majored in history from Japan&#8217;s Meiji University, told Xinhua that he has been attending the testimony meeting of the Nanjing Massacre in Tokyo every year since 2015.</p>
<p>Each year, the organizers invite various people to talk about the massacre in different places and perspectives, which offers a rare opportunity to learn about the truth of history in Japan, he said, adding that he is concerned that some people in Japan do not know the truth of history, and some even attempt to falsify history, forget history and deny the existence of the Nanjing Massacre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time I listen to the stories with tears in my eyes, I feel sorry (for the Chinese people),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Massacre took place after the Japanese troops captured the city on Dec. 13, 1937. Over six weeks, they killed about 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers in one of the most barbaric episodes of World War II.&nbsp;</p>

(Xinhua/Zhao Ge)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />Leaders of some Chinese American groups have expressed firm opposition to and issued a strong condemnation of the Xinjiang-related bill passed by the US House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The passage of the so-called &#8220;Uygur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019&#8221; earlier this month is a gross interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs, and lays bare the double standards the United States is playing with on counterterrorism and human rights issues, said Liang Guanjun, president of the United Chinese Association of Eastern US Inc., at a gathering of over 100 Chinese Americans on Tuesday in Flushing, New York.</p>
<p>The political move will encourage the spread of terrorism in Xinjiang and have a negative impact on the development of US-China relations, Liang said.</p>
<p>Ma Yue, president of New York Association for the Peaceful Unification of China, said that Americans, especially New Yorkers, understand the pain inflicted by terrorism.</p>
<p>However, by passing the Xinjiang-related bill, the US House turned a blind eye to China&#8217;s efforts to eradicate terrorism, and the move will hinder the development of counterterrorism operations worldwide, Ma said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why conducting certain crimes are defined as terrorism in the United States, while doing the same things in China are somehow defined as a movement defending human rights? This is purely playing with double standards,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chairman of Hong Kong&#8217;s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) Anthony Neoh (second from right) at a press conference on Agust 23 to announce the establishment of an international expert panel to facilitate the council&#8217;s study on recent public order events Photo: Screenshot from IPCC website</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) on Wednesday denied its international experts &#8220;quit&#8221; as some Western media reported, saying they had stepped aside after finishing an interim report.</p>
<p>Anthony Neoh, IPCC chairman, told Hong Kong media on Wednesday that the international experts were not resigning. It was just they finished their current phase of work collecting evidence and drafting a report. They had showed interest to come back and help when the IPCC moves to the next phase, he said.</p>
<p>Tony Tse Wai-chuen, a lawmaker and IPCC vice-president, also said Wednesday the international experts did not resign but stepped aside after finishing this stage of their work, local media reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statements came after the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday published a report, quoting the panel as saying it &#8220;steps down from probe of Hong Kong police&#8221; as the city&#8217;s watchdog &#8220;lacks powers to properly investigate&#8221; use of force during police operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using &#8220;stepping down&#8221; to describe the panel&#8217;s normal working arrangement was just a typical trick of some Western media, according to Fan Peng, a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong &amp; Macao Studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The media was exploiting the public&#8217;s limited knowledge of the IPCC panel&#8217;s remit and creating the impression that the police watchdog was restricted from working properly.</p>
<p>The analyst pointed out that the international expert panel, hired by the IPCC, has its missions and working pace within the framework of laws and administrative regulations of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel helped assess the independence and use of force of Hong Kong police operations and was designed to be a consultative body rather than an instructor, Fan noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IPCC doesn&#8217;t have to embrace everything the panel comes up with,&#8221; Fan said.</p>
<p>He also noted if the panel has offered advice, they must pass judicial organs before taking any effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC announced to establish an international expert panel on August 23 and later on September 4 released a list of the five-member panel chaired by Dennis O&#8217;Connor, who had investigated police action during disturbances in Britain in 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the IPCC website, the overseas experts&#8217; role is to provide international experience and advice for the IPCC&#8217;s thematic study on police practices and procedures arising from recent public order events.</p>
<p>Ian Grenville Cross, Hong Kong&#8217;s former director of public prosecutions, told Wen Wei Po on Wednesday that the IPCC has many experienced experts who can do the work in accordance with mature internal procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The international experts were mainly polishing the report to make it in line with international standards, Cross said, adding the experts were not familiar with the situation in Hong Kong and did not play a decisive role in forming the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anthony Neoh on Saturday told media that the expert panel did not have a thorough understanding of the complicated situation in Hong Kong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I already told them their opinions are noted with thanks but we must act according to laws,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The council also included police watchdog experts from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and a British specialist on crowd behavior.</p>
<p>One of the council&#8217;s specialists, Clifford Stott, in early November posted a report on Twitter saying that the IPCC had structural limitations in the scope and power of the inquiry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC replied then that the document released was not an announcement of the panel, but the personal action of Stott without prior consultation with the IPCC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC was disappointed with the tweet, according to a statement by the police watchdog.</p>

<p>Netizens hailed Peking University for sacking Professor Feng Renjie on Wednesday for violating teachers&#8217; ethics and discipline over an alleged sex scandal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The university revoked Feng&#8217;s qualifications as a teacher and disqualified him from relevant talent schemes.</p>
<p>Frequent sexual assault scandals among college teachers have prompted Chinese netizens to call for a mechanism to prevent sexual harassment in colleges and universities.</p>
<p>A sound investigation system is required to protect the informant and accused, experts said.</p>
<p>Peking University launched an investigation on December 2 into a report that Feng has maintained sexual relations with multiple women at the same time, including a brief marriage to a college student.</p>
<p>The university&#8217;s decision comes on the heels of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics&#8217; decision to dismiss an associate professor on Monday for allegedly sexually assaulting a student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar case happened on October 14 when Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University dismissed a teacher who was detained on criminal charges for allegedly raping a female student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netizens compiled a list of professors suspected of sexual harassment or scandals at universities across China on Sina Weibo, and encouraged more victims to expose scandals.</p>
<p>Unlike sexual harassment in public spaces, sexual harassment on university campuses is often more insidious, Zhu Wei, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students in a naturally disadvantaged position sometimes find it hard to resist &#8216;excessive care&#8217; shown by their teachers. It is also more difficult for them to obtain evidence and defend their rights after being violated, especially when the teacher has a final say on their test scores,&#8221; said a student, who had been sexually harassed but declined to tell her name.</p>
<p>Zhu emphasized the importance of an investigation mechanism on campus which can respond quickly to victims. But it is also necessary to prevent the abuse of a whistleblower if the complaint involves a false accusation.</p>

Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>The purpose behind the Xinjiang-related bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives is to impede China&#8217;s development by creating trouble, General Secretary of the Egyptian Communist Party Salah Adly has said.</p>
<p>The passage of the Xinjiang-related bill is &#8220;a blatant and aggressive approach&#8221; Washington has adopted against China, Adly told Xinhua in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The United States fabricates problems and stirs up trouble &#8220;in an attempt to hold back China,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>On Dec. 3, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the so-called &#8220;Uygur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019,&#8221; maliciously attacking the human rights conditions in Xinjiang and slandering China&#8217;s de-radicalization and anti-terrorism efforts.</p>

<p>China has expressed strong indignation over and firm opposition to the passing of the bill.</p>
<p>Adly also denounced the United States&#8217; repeated interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs, noting that the U.S. move violates &#8220;all international norms in an unprecedented way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He praised the Chinese leadership and government for dealing with the U.S. provocations &#8220;wisely and powerfully at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese leadership is keen to maintain global peace and stability,&#8221; he said, adding that &#8220;China is a country that highly respects international law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adly noted that China is always swift to clarify the facts by adopting an approach that exposes the U.S. practices and refutes them in front of the international community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chinese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Zhang Xiao said here on Tuesday that the year 2019 has seen tangible results in the development of Sino-Kazakh relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2019, First President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and (Kazakh) President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev visited China. Tokayev&#8217;s visit lifted the relationship to a permanent comprehensive strategic partnership. This is unprecedented,&#8221; Zhang told reporters from both countries in a group interview.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev was awarded the Friendship Medal of the People&#8217;s Republic of China for his outstanding contributions to the development of Sino-Kazakh relations, the ambassador added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kazakhstan&#8217;s participation in the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai was a complete success,&#8221; Zhang noted. &#8220;Contracts worth 160 million U.S. dollars were signed, which would increase access of Kazakh products to the Chinese market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two-way trade is expected to reach a new record of more than 20 billion dollars in 2019, said Zhang, adding that a number of important industrial and investment projects have also been launched.</p>
<p>&#8220;New impetus has been injected into cultural exchanges. The first Sino-Kazakh film &#8216;The Composer&#8217; gains widespread recognition in both countries,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It won four awards at a recent annual award in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue high-level political dialogues on bilateral relations and on international and regional issues,&#8221; Zhang noted.</p>
<p>He added that bilateral cooperation will focus on the development of relations between young people, think tanks, educational institutions and art groups of the two countries.</p>

<p>Beijing&#8217;s new Daxing International Airport used its cutting-edge blind landing equipment for the first time on Tuesday morning to safeguard service amid low visibility.</p>
<p>At 6:57 a.m., under the command of the tower controller, an Airbus 330 of Finnish national carrier Finnair landed safely on the runway of Daxing International Airport with visibility below 175 meters.</p>
<p>It was the first passenger flight to conduct a landing with visibility below 175 meters, known as a Category-IIIB landing, since the airport opened to flights.</p>
<p>At 7:29 a.m., a Boeing 738 of China United Airlines took off from the runway, becoming the first aircraft to leave Daxing International Airport with visibility below 175 meters.</p>

<p>Daxing Airport used the highest-level ground lighting guidance system amid the low visibility.</p>
<p>The airport opened to flights on Sept. 25. Located 46 km south of downtown Beijing, the new aviation hub is shaped like a phoenix spreading its wings. Its passenger and cargo throughput are expected to reach 72 million and 2 million tonnes, respectively, by 2025, with 620,000 takeoffs and landings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese language education is increasingly sought after by more countries, global representatives told the 2019 International Chinese Language Education Conference on Monday in Changsha, Central China&#8217;s Hunan Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local demand has been the main driver of Chinese language popularity, based on China&#8217;s growing international influence and overseas trade, the representatives said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 1,000 delegates from over 160 countries attended the conference in Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;As China&#8217;s overall influence has increased and China-Japan relations have improved, Chinese has become the second most spoken foreign language across Japanese campuses in recent years,&#8221; said Tutaka Furukawa, former vice-president of the International Society for Chinese Teaching, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>By November, 69 countries and regions have officially incorporated Chinese language teaching into their national education systems including the UK, Russia, South Africa, Japan, South Korea and Australia.</p>
<p>Madagascar will join the list next year, said Andriamamonjy Oniniaina, a Confucius Institute teacher at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar.</p>
<p>Chinese-speaking talent is in a great demand in countries that have joined the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, Andriamamonjy said.</p>
<p>Confucius institutes have attracted many young Africans by integrating Chinese learning with e-commerce, agricultural and IT technologies, Andriamamonjy said.</p>
<p>Combining Chinese language learning with vocational training has become a trend of Confucius institutes in Southeast Asia and African countries, Andriamamonjy told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to speak Chinese can triple their salaries,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>There are reportedly 550 Confucius institutes and 1,172 Confucius classrooms in 162 countries and regions. About 100 million people are learning Chinese globally.</p>
<p>In 2019, eight countries &#8211; Haiti, the Central African Republic, Chad,<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>, Maldives, East Timor, Saudi Arabia and Dominica &#8211; applied to set up institutes for the first time.</p>

<p>An official-designed application for poverty alleviation in China came into the spotlight and received mixed reviews online over the weekend amid the country&#8217;s sprint to end poverty by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The app, whose name is roughly translated as &#8220;social poverty alleviation,&#8221; was initially developed in 2017 by a poverty-alleviation promotion website under the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, aimed at establishing a poverty profile and resolving practical problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app has multiple functions like direct donations, fundraising and online ordering of products of impoverished farmers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people recently recommended the app through Twitter-like Sina Weibo, hailing the app&#8217;s convenience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January, the office released a guideline aimed at getting rid of poverty by patronizing poverty areas and purchasing local agricultural products.</p>
<p>But others complained about the application&#8217;s limited search functions. Some said they were forced to install the app because some grass-roots government officials wanted to show off the installation rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lazy men begging on the platform has also jarred some users. Netizens said they have come across healthy young men in underdeveloped areas who asked for a motorcycle and a pet dog without any explanation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Shaoxiang, an expert on poverty relief legislation at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the app is a nice supplement to poverty alleviation work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the process of grass-roots governments needs to be refined with supervision from society and a proper feedback mechanism to avoid formalism, noted Yu. He suggested that more charitable organizations assist and supervise the government&#8217;s promotion of the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, the office stressed that poverty alleviation must be practical and realistic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;To reach those who remain in poverty is a hardest mission,&#8221; Yu said. &#8220;There is also a need to continuously expand the scope of social assistance and improve the level of social insurance.&#8221;</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2018, the number of poor people living in rural areas dropped from 98.99 million to 16.6 million. By the end of this year, about 95 percent of the country&#8217;s poor will have been lifted out of poverty.</p>

<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson appreciated Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev&#8217;s fair and just remarks on Northwest China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region, saying that the president&#8217;s stance on Xinjiang demonstrated the high-level mutual trust of the two countries.</p>
<p>Before visiting Germany, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev told German media that allegations from human rights organizations regarding China&#8217;s Xinjiang are not true, especially those concerning the Kazak ethnic group living in Xinjiang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The president said Xinjiang launched training centers and it is not true to say China kept all Kazak people in so-called &#8220;concentration camps.&#8221; People of Kazak ethnic group living in Xinjiang are Chinese citizens and Xinjiang affairs are China&#8217;s internal affairs, he said, adding that Kazakhstan would not interfere with China&#8217;s domestic affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry, said at a press briefing on Tuesday that &#8220;we highly appreciate President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev&#8217;s stance. China and Kazakhstan are good neighbors and have a permanent comprehensive strategic partnership.&#8221; She continued to say &#8220;the leaders of the two countries stressed to deepen mutual support and cooperation under the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative to achieve shared development and prosperity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chinese government&#8217;s Xinjiang policies have received comments of support in the international community, Hua said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A certain country wants to hype Xinjiang topics; their deeds are against the will of most of the people and their malicious attempt will not succeed, said Hua.&nbsp;</p>
