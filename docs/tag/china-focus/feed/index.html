<br />China sent a new Earth observation satellite into space from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China&#8217;s Shanxi Province at 7:52 a.m. Thursday (Beijing Time).</p>
<p>The satellite, Gaofen-12, was launched aboard a Long March-4C rocket and entered the planned orbit successfully. It was the 320th flight mission of the Long March carrier rocket series.</p>
<p>As part of the country&#8217;s high-definition earth observation project, the microwave remote sensing satellite is capable of providing photographs with a resolution of better than a meter.</p>
<p>Gaofen-12 will be used in land surveys, urban planning, road network design and crop yield estimate, as well as disaster relief. It can also serve projects along the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a>.</p>
<p>Both the satellite and the carrier rocket were developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />A Chinese reusable carrier rocket that uses liquid oxygen-methane propellants made its first public appearance Friday at the ongoing 2019 Zhongguancun Forum in Beijing. </p>
<p>The rocket named the Hyperbola-2, will be launched for the first time in 2021. It may make up for China&#8217;s lack of reusable liquid-propellant rockets. </p>
<p>The Hyperbola-2 was developed by a Beijing-based private rocket developer i-Space. Its primary stage can be reused, reducing more than 70 percent of the rocket production cost, according to Dong Yanmin, the company&#8217;s vice president of technology. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />It will not only meet the growing demand for small and medium-sized satellite launches but also provide emergency and ride-share launches, Dong said. </p>
<p>The 28-meter-long rocket, with a takeoff weight of 90 tonnes, has a lift capability of sending 1.9 tonnes of payload to low-Earth orbit. </p>
<p>The rocket is low-cost and reliable, which can provide high-quality satellite launches, Dong said. </span></p>

<p>Bu Zhigao, director of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of CAAS, said China is facing a great challenge in controlling the spread of African swine fever. It is urgent to develop more powerful tools such as a vaccine to prevent the disease. </p>
<p>&#8220;The breakthrough in unveiling the fine structure of the virus is important and fundamental research, which will provide clues to explore fundamental mechanisms for the infection, pathogenicity and immunology of African swine fever, as well as vaccine development,&#8221; Bu said. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />Scientists successfully isolated the epidemic strain of the African swine fever virus, which is spreading in China. It took the research team four months to collect over 100 TB of high-quality data. </p>
<p>The research showed the virus has a unique structure of five layers: the outer membrane, capsid, double-layer inner membrane, core-shell and genome. </p>
<p>It contains more than 30,000 protein subunits, forming a spherical particle with a diameter of about 260 nanometers. </p>
<p>The study identified structural proteins of the virus, revealing potential protective antigens and key information on the epitope, the part of an antigen molecule to which an antibody attaches itself. </p>
<p>The research also showed the complex arrangement and interaction mode of the structural proteins and proposed the possible assembly mechanism of the virus, providing an important clue as to how it invades host cells and evades and antagonizes the host antiviral immunity. </p>
<p>Wang Xiangxi, a researcher at the Institute of Biophysics of CAS, said the five-layer structure of the African swine fever virus is very rare and more complicated than other viruses. </p>
<p>&#8220;The size of the African swine fever virus is huge, it is the largest one among the viruses unraveled by Chinese scientists. Its diameter is 10 times longer than the diameter of the hepatitis A virus,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;African swine fever, with an epidemic history of nearly 100 years, is a challenging global problem. It has a stable structure and can survive for months under normal temperatures, posing a great challenge for prevention and control. Scientists have limited knowledge of the virus. We hope to open the door to have a better understanding of the disease.&#8221; </p>
<p>Rao Zihe, a CAS academician and one of the leading scientists of the research, said unveiling the structure of African swine fever is the first important step in the &#8220;long march&#8221; to tackle the disease. Researchers will continue to analyze the structure of the virus&#8217;s core-shell, and how the virus interacts with the receptors. </p>
<p>Shao Feng, another CAS academician and deputy director of the National Institute of Biological Sciences, said compared with other viruses, scientists&#8217; knowledge about African swine fever is almost zero. Cooperation between scientists including immunologists is needed to push forward vaccine research. </p>
<p>&#8220;The unveiled structure of the virus is so exquisite, and the analysis work is so beautiful. I believe it can provide help for not only developing vaccines, but also diagnosis and producing medicine for treating the disease,&#8221; said Chen Xinwen, head of the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health of the CAS. </p>
<p>African swine fever, first described in Kenya in 1921, is a highly contagious viral disease of swine with mortality rates approaching 100 percent. Over the past decade, the disease has spread through many countries, posing a serious risk of further expansion. </p>
<p>During the period from January to October 2019, the World Organization for Animal Health was notified by 26 countries of new or ongoing outbreaks: 13 in Europe, 10 in Asia and three in Africa. </p>
<p>With no vaccine or treatment available, culling pigs is the most effective way to contain the outbreaks, more than 30 million pigs have been culled during 2018 and 2019. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />The African swine fever pandemics have caused estimated economic losses of 2 billion US dollars for swine production worldwide. The African swine fever virus is stable in the environment and transmits rapidly and efficiently among pigs, scientists say. </p>
<p>African swine fever is believed to only infect pigs. No humans or other species are known to have been infected. </p>
<p>China reported its first case of the disease in August 2018 in the northeastern province of Liaoning. Later outbreaks were reported in other provincial regions. </p>
<p>China is the world&#8217;s largest pig producer, and it is an arduous task to control African swine fever. China has conducted lab research on the vaccine against the disease, but the vaccines under development are still not perfect, according to Bu. </p>
<p>Previous developments of the vaccines used traditional methods, lacking clear theoretical guidance. Recent research may prove beneficial for new designs of the vaccines, Bu said. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />Chinese scientists are paying close attention to a repeating fast radio burst by making follow-up observations during the country&#8217;s National Day holiday. </p>
<p>Scientists are not sure yet what kind of celestial body it comes from, nor do they know its distance from us, said Qian Lei, associate researcher at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. </p>
<p>The repetitive burst, code-named FRB121102, was first discovered in September when researchers processed daily cosmic radio signal data received by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), also dubbed as the &#8220;China Sky Eye.&#8221; </p>
<p>Rapid bursts are usually short and intense, far less numerous than pulsars, and such a repetitive burst is even less common, according to Qian, also head of the &#8220;China Sky Eye&#8221; observation program. </p>
<p>&#8220;We hope to find out the nature and potential laws of the repeating fast radio burst by studying its pulses statistically,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Chinese scientists believe more detection and research may help clarify the origins and physical mechanisms of the so-called &#8220;mysterious signals from deep space.&#8221; </p>
<p>Li Di, a scientist with the National Astronomical Observatories, has told Xinhua that FAST was expected to discover dozens of new fast radio bursts after installing a 19-beam receiver to carry out simultaneous surveys of multiple scientific targets. </p>
<p>Located in a naturally deep and round karst depression in southwest China&#8217;s Guizhou Province, the world&#8217;s largest single-dish radio telescope has identified 96 new pulsars since October 2017. </span></p>

<p>Egyptian and Chinese teams announced Sunday the start of the implementation phase of the China-funded &#8220;MisrSat II&#8221; satellite project.</p>
<p>During the kick-off meeting, which was held at the Egyptian Space City near Egypt&#8217;s new administrative capital, both sides signed the documents of launching the project that is funded by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a ceremony to launch the satellite project was held during the fourth<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1065050.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China-Arab States Expo</a>, being held in Yinchuan, capital of northwest China&#8217;s Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>Egypt and China signed in January an agreement on a 72-million-US dollar Chinese grant for Egypt&#8217;s MisrSat II satellite, which is a small high-resolution remote sensing satellite.</p>
<p>Egypt sees the project as another major cooperation between the two countries in the field of space after signing an agreement to build the Egyptian Satellite Assembly, Integration and Test Center which is expected to be fully established this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the kick-off meeting for starting the project of MisrSat II satellite which will be implemented thanks to a grant from China,&#8221; Ahmed al-Rafie, head of the MisrSat II Satellite project, told Xinhua, adding &#8220;the satellite will help Egypt with its development plans in many fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>The official said the satellite will be developed through cooperative and joint work between Chinese and Egyptian teams who work in parallel, noting that there will be Chinese guidance throughout the project phases.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will provide the Egyptian side with experience in the development of satellite space systems,&#8221; he said, adding that it will take the teams about 35 months to finish the building of the satellite.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design phases will be carried out in parallel in Egypt and China, but the assembly and integration of the satellite will be done in Egypt at Egyptian Satellite Assembly, Integration and Test Center,&#8221; said the official.</p>
<p>In addition to the satellite, a ground control station and a ground application system to support the operation of the satellite will be also supplied, al-Rafie said.</p>
<p>He revealed that the lifetime of the satellite is five years, while the lifetime of the ground station is 15 years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Liao Liqiang said he believes that China and Egypt have made &#8220;four firsts&#8221; in this project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first is that Egypt is the first country to carry out satellite cooperation with China under the framework of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second is that China will help Egypt build a complete satellite assembly integration and test center, in which scientists and engineers from China and Egypt will jointly complete the assembly, integration and test of Egypt&#8217;s MisrSat II,&#8221; said the ambassador.</p>
<p>The third, Liao said, is that China will help Egypt build its aerospace team and will jointly train Egyptian aerospace experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fourth is that after the project is completed, Egypt will be the first African country to have complete satellite assembly integration testing capabilities,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Liao noted China is willing to work with Egypt to build Egypt&#8217;s own aerospace science and technology talents for the independent development of Egypt&#8217;s space field.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also willing to make our contributions to the economic and social development of Egypt, including the fields of agriculture, environmental protection, and anti-desertification,&#8221; the ambassador said.</p>

<p>Chinese astronomers have detected repeated fast radio bursts (FRB) &#8211; mysterious signals believed to be from a source about 3 billion light years from Earth &#8211; with the largest and most sensitive radio telescope ever built.</p>
<p>Scientists detected the signals with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and they are carefully cross-checking and processing them, according to researchers at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC).</p>
<p>FRBs are the brightest bursts known in the universe. They are called &#8220;fast&#8221; because these blips are very short, only several milliseconds in duration. But there is no reasonable explanation for their origin.</p>
<p>The detection of the repeated bursts might help shed light on the origin and physical mechanisms of FRBs, said researchers.</p>
