<p>China extended its dominance in a list of the world&#8217;s fastest supercomputers by the number of systems, according to a semi-annual ranking of the Top500 published Monday. </p>
<p>The share of installations in China continues to rise strongly with 228 (45.6 percent) of all systems now listed as being installed in China. The share of system listed in the United States remains near its all time low at 23.4 percent. </p>
<p>The aggregate performance gap between China and the United States shrunk. The US systems translated to a 37.1 percent share, while China is close behind with a 32.3-percent performance share. </p>
<p>The list published in June had the United States with 38.4 percent of the aggregate performance and China with 29.9 percent. </p>
<p>The aggregate performance of the 500 systems, based on the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark, continued to rise, sitting at 1.65 exaflops. </p>
<p>Also, as a reflection of China&#8217;s lead in numbers, the top three system manufacturers with regard to the number of installations are Lenovo, Sugon, and Inspur. But Intel has maintained the dominance at the chip level, with its processors present in about 94 percent of all systems. </p>
<p>The top 10 of the list remained unchanged as Summit and Sierra, both IBM-built supercomputers, grabbed the top two spots, followed by two Chinese systems, Sunway TaihuLight and Tianhe-2A. </p>
<p>The entry level to the list has risen to 1.14 petaflops, up from 1.02 petaflops in the previous list in June 2019, according to the Top500 list.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s Tencent Music Entertainment Group reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue on November 11 as the streaming company added more paying users.</p>
<p>However, it recorded the slowest rise in a widely watched metric for its biggest business, social entertainment services, which executives attributed to growing competition.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s monthly average revenue per paying user from its social entertainment services unit rose 7.4 percent to 127.30 yuan ($18.20), its slowest growth since it went public in December.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize that it may be slightly below where we previously thought it would be,&#8221; Tony Yip, chief strategy officer, said on a conference call. &#8220;That&#8217;s primarily because of increasing competition that we are facing with the short video platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tencent Music competes with Alibaba-backed NetEase Cloud Music in streaming services, and with short video sites such as Bytedance&#8217;s Douyin and Tencent-backed Kuaishou in social entertainment.</p>
<p>Although its music streaming unit has more users, the company&#8217;s biggest revenue drivers are social entertainment services, including karaoke platforms, where users can live stream concerts and shows.</p>
<p>The social entertainment business reported 12.2 million paying users during the quarter, up 23.2 percent.</p>
<p>Yip said the firm will step up investment aimed at user growth, with a view to reach a younger demographic with content more appealing to them as well as initiatives such as offline singing competitions and partnerships with game studios.</p>
<p>The company also said it is exploring opportunities to take its services outside China and hopes to introduce monetization methods such as virtual gifts to Thailand.</p>
<p>Although Tencent Music&#8217;s user base is nearly three times that of world&#8217;s largest music streaming service, peer and stakeholder Spotify, its paying users are comparatively fewer.</p>

<p>In mid-October, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the national strategy for artificial intelligence (AI) development during the period until 2030.</p>
<p>Russian media reported on Wednesday, citing the country&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, that Russia&#8217;s military will get a decision-making system that uses the latest data processing technologies.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the system will propose possible scenarios of actions in combat, starting with the most potentially effective.</p>
<p>The system will also be capable of collecting a nearly unlimited amount of information, including text, video, and graphical data.</p>
<p>&#8220;During combat, this data will be received from various sources &#8211; from soldiers and military hardware, including UAVs&#8221;, the statement reads.</p>
<p>Russia is planning to triple spending on its digital economy sector by the year 2024. One of the main aims of the project is to create stable and safe information and telecommunication infrastructure capable of processing and storing large amounts of data.</p>
<p>The project also stipulates that Russian government bodies and organisations will use Russia-made software.</p>

<p>Open-core platform GitLab replied to the Global Times on Tuesday and admitted the decision to block Chinese and Russian employees was made due to an unstable domestic atmosphere in the US after the country&#8217;s security authorities listed China among countries seen as &#8220;cyber threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Natasha Woods, senior manager of corporate communications with Gitlab, the company is still reviewing the listings.</p>
<p>Woods told the Global Times that the move by the cyber security division of the US Department of Homeland Security has caused wide ranging concerns for companies worried about their users&#8217; data as people working as support engineers and site reliability engineers are allowed to access the data.</p>
<p>The earlier announcement banned Chinese and Russians from those two roles. The company currently does not have team members from China, Russia or<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a> working in those two roles, Woods noted. However, she stressed the company has employees from more than 60 countries, emphasizing its inclusiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each country has unique and complex rules, laws and regulations, which can affect how we conduct business, as well as the employability of citizens of those countries,&#8221; Woods said.</p>
<p>GitLab was criticized by its own employees and the public after it announced it would not hire engineers from China or Russia. According to the earlier decision, current staff members are also prohibited from moving to these countries.</p>
<p>Candice Ciresi, the company&#8217;s director of global risk and compliance, opposed the decision, saying that it is contradictory as the company boasts that it accepts any customer not prohibited by law, but at the same time blocks China and Russia based on &#8220;perceived political climate.&#8221;</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0//attachment/2019/2019-10-29/8c8f09fe-03c3-4a2a-a548-09cee3f3b733.jpeg"><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>As the fourth industrial revolution is gaining momentum, the job loss issue is a significant concern. Often the numbers being mentioned are based on conjectures &#8212; like Bangladesh&#8217;s garments industry will lose 60 per cent jobs by 2030. There are also pieces of evidence that technology has been polarising the job market across professions as well as countries. However, prediction of the effect of intelligent machines on the labour market appears to be conflicting. For example, a Swiss think-tank predicts that robots will displace 75 million jobs globally by 2022 but create 133 million new ones! There has also been disagreement about &#8220;an influential 2013 forecast by the Oxford University that found about 47 per cent of jobs in the US in 2010 and 35 per cent in the UK were at &#8220;high risk&#8221; of being automated over the following 20 years.&#8221; Such conflicting predictions, as well as unclear polarising effects, often create grave confusion, leading to inaction. Such a situation demands answer to a vital question: how does labour-replacing technological change affect the allocation of workers to jobs, and what are its effects on wage distribution?</p>
<p>Technology availability opens the option of redesigning tasks and their allocations to two major factors of production: machines and workers. Within the context of organisational economics, firms optimally design or acquire machines, train workers, and assign these factors to tasks. In a firm, there are three broad categories of jobs: i. low skilled workers at the bottom, ii. middle layer professionals, and iii. top management. Irrespective of its nature and position in the organisational hierarchy, every task demands certain knowledge and its execution. Part of a task-specific knowledge is the innate capacity of human workers, and the remaining part is acquired through training. For example, without having formal training, being empowered with innate capacities, a little kid learns how to detect and hold an object, or walk through a crowd. On the other hand, machines are built with inanimate materials, which are devoid of knowledge. Through meticulous effort, knowledge is built in the machines to play a role in executing tasks, often in partnership with human workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Production related tasks are highly knowledge-intensive. But, to our surprise, workers having the least amount of formal education or training are performing them. In performing these tasks, workers are executing a lion&#8217;s share of knowledge through their innate capacities like vision, touch, manipulation, movement, and natural language communication. Consistent with the findings from computer science and robotics, these tasks are challenging from an engineering perspective but easy for humans to carry out due to their innate capacities. Despite the massive engagement of innate capacities, which are highly difficult for machines to acquire, every production-related task also demands additional codified skill that can be acquired through training. Over the years, tools are being developed to gradually take over this segment, consequently increasing productivity and lowering the demand for labour. To facilitate this, tasks are divided into an increasing number of sub-tasks, and machines are developed to take over the codified knowledge component in executing them. As a result, contrary to common perception, training-needs for workers in performing these tasks have been diminishing. Such an effect is also reducing the variability of usable skills among workers resulting in growing equality in pay. Evidence cited in different research reports substantiates this reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the middle layer of the organisational hierarchy, professionals require high-level education and training to qualify for such jobs. These tasks demand high-level training intensity to acquire the needed knowledge. Through education and training, codified knowledge is developed among these professionals to execute given tasks, whether in processing numbers, solving mathematical equations, or diagnosing diseases. It has been found that information and communication technologies have empowered us to build such codified knowledge competence in machines. It&#8217;s far easier to empower machines to calculate the standard deviation of a series of numbers than teaching a machine how to read number plats by processing images. As a result, over the last several decades, there has been disproportionate job loss in the middle layer of the organisational hierarchy. Such an effect is often termed job polarisation or hollow-out middle layer.</p>
<p>The top management task demands high-level codified knowledge to scale up vital innate capacities like imagination, abstraction, and articulation to comprehend the past and present dynamics, and predict the unfolding future. The growth of ICT based innovations in the form of data analytics or enterprise resource planning software have been empowering the top management capability, as opposed to making those jobs redundant. As opposed to repeating the past decisions or replicating the decisions taken by competing firms, top management of firms is required to make different decisions. The unfolding dynamics primarily demands this uniqueness, often created by technology innovation. For example, robotics, automation, and intelligent machines have been shaping both product and process innovation, creating waves of change in virtually every industry. As a result, top management is demanding increasing support from a decision-making system to deal with the growing uncertainty. Often help from technology is falling short in dealing with the technology triggered complexity, resulting in growing demand for top management performance, which is creating higher-level inequality in wages at the top layer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last 50 years, a large chunk of middle layer jobs has been delegated to machines. Although those tasks require high-level training, the needed knowledge is codified, which is highly amenable to be embodied into machines. On the other hand, bottom layer tasks requiring innate human capacities were left to low skilled workers. Most of the jobs for export-oriented manufacturing in developing countries like Bangladesh fall into this category.</p>
<p>Emergence of intelligent machine technology has created the opportunity of building innate human capacities like vision into machines. But it is quite challenging. For example, upon investing more than $80 billion in R&amp;D, researchers have not succeeded yet in fully imitating human driving capacity into automobiles. Similarly, progress is being made to replicate vision-guided feeding of fabric to sewing machines. Despite the difficulty, it&#8217;s being anticipated that low skilled tasks requiring innate human capacity are also the target of automation in the age of intelligent machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effect of intelligent machine technologies driving the fourth industrial revolution will cause job loss in the middle layer. Despite the high-level engineering complexity, low skilled tasks requiring innate human capacities are now targeted to be automated too. Contrary to these two levels, the top management task will likely be demanding increasing human role, to be obtained through the innate endowment, technology augmentation, and formal training. On the other hand, the effect of technology on jobs will also vary among countries, as technology-innovating countries will be creating jobs, while killing jobs in labour-saving technology importing countries. Despite conflicting predictions, intelligent machine technology will kill as well as create jobs.&nbsp; But the effect of smart machines on the labour market will not likely happen in a uniform and linear fashion. It will vary across organisational layers, firms, industries, and countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We could soon live in a world where domestic service robots perform household chores and clean up for us as we go about our daily lives. But what if your new mechanical helper decides to put your laptop in the dishwasher, places your cat in the bathtub and throws your treasured possessions into the trash?</p>
<p>Current vision systems being tested on &#8220;simulated&#8221; domestic robots in the cluttered, unpredictable environments of the real world, are suffering severely from what experts refer to as overconfidence &#8212; meaning robots are unable to know when they don&#8217;t know exactly what an object is.</p>
<p>When introduced into our day to day lives, this overconfidence poses a huge risk to people&#8217;s safety and belongings, and represents a barrier for the development of autonomous robotics.</p>
<p>&#8220;These (models) are often trained on a specific data set, so you show it a lot of examples of different objects. But in the real world, you often encounter situations that are not part of that training data set,&#8221; Niko Sunderhauf explained to Xinhua. He works as a chief investigator with the Australian Center for Robotic Vision (ACRV), headquartered at Queensland University of Technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, if you train these systems to detect 100 different objects, and then it sees one that it has not seen before, it will just overconfidently think it is one of the object types it knows, and then do something with that, and that can be damaging to the object or very unsafe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in an effort to curb these potentially cocky machines, Sunderhauf&#8217;s team at the ACRV launched a world-first competition, the Robotic Vision Challenge, inviting teams from around the world to find a way to make robots less sure of themselves, and safer for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Sunderhauf hopes that by crowdsourcing the problem and tapping into researchers&#8217; natural competitiveness, they can overcome this monumental stumbling block of modern robotics.</p>
<p>The open-ended challenge has already captured global attention due to its implications regarding one of the most excitement inducing and ear-tingling concepts in robotics today &#8212; deep learning.</p>
<p>While it dates back to the 1980s, deep learning &#8220;boomed&#8221; in 2012 and was hailed as a revolution in artificial intelligence, enabling robots to solve all kinds of complex problems without assistance, and behaving more like humans in the way they see, listen and think.</p>
<p>When applied to tasks like photo-captioning, online ad targeting, or even medical diagnosis, deep learning has proved incredibly efficient, and many organizations reliably employ these methods, with the cost of mistakes being relatively low.</p>
<p>However, when you introduce these intelligence systems into a physical machine which will interact with people and animals in the real world &#8212; the stakes are decidedly higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you put these systems on robots that work in the real world the consequences can be severe, so it&#8217;s really important to get this part right and have this inbuilt uncertainty and caution in the system,&#8221; Sunderhauf said.</p>
<p>To solve these issues would undoubtedly play a part in taking robotics to the next level, not just in delivering us our autonomous housekeepers, but in a range of other applications from autonomous cars and drones to smart sidewalks and robotic shop attendants.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is why this push is coming out of the robotic vision lab at the moment from our side, because we understand it&#8217;s important and we understand that deep learning can do a lot of important things,&#8221; Sunderhauf said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you need to combine these aspects with being able to detect objects and understand them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since it was launched in the middle of the year, the competition has had 111 submissions from 18 teams all around the world and Sunderhauf said that while results have been promising, there is still a long way to go to where they want to be.</p>
<p>The competition provides participants with 200,000 realistic images of living spaces from 40 simulated indoor video sequences, including kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms and even outdoor living areas, complete with clutter, and rich with uncertain objects.</p>
<p>Entrants are required to develop the best possible system of probabilistic object detection, which can accurately estimate spatial and semantic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Sunderhauf hopes that the ongoing nature of the challenge will motivate teams to come up with a solution which may well propel robotics research and application on a global scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think everybody&#8217;s a little bit competitive and if you can compare how good your algorithm and your research is with a lot of other people around the world who are working on the same problem, it&#8217;s just very inspiring,&#8221; Sunderhauf said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the Olympic Games &#8212; when everybody competes under the same rules, and you can see who is doing the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, Sunderhauf will travel with members of his team to the annual International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) held in Macao, China to present and discuss their findings so far.</p>
<p>As one of three leading robotics conferences in the world, IROS is a valuable opportunity for researchers to come together to compare notes, and collaborate on taking technology to the next level.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a lot of interaction and discussion around the ways forward and that will be really exciting to see what everybody thinks and really excited to see different directions,&#8221; Sunderhauf said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country should accelerate the development of blockchain technology, regarding it as a crucial breakthrough for the self-innovation of core technologies.</p>
<p>In a study session of the Communist Party of China Central Committee Political Bureau on the development and trend of blockchain technology on Thursday, Xi underscored the importance of blockchain technology in the new round of technological innovation and industrial transformation, urging more efforts to hasten the development of the sector, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology refers to a digital database containing information that can be simultaneously used and shared within a large decentralized network. It has rapidly developed around the world in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time that China&#8217;s top leader stressed the significance of blockchain technology by singling it out. Previously, it might have been mentioned together with other newly emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and big data,&#8221; said Cao Yin, an expert in the blockchain sector.</p>
<p>Cao told the Global Times on Friday that he felt inspired by President Xi&#8217;s guidance in the blockchain sector. &#8220;It indicates that blockchain technology has become a battleground that global players will compete in, and it is important for China to turn into a cyber power and digital power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Research on blockchain standardization should be strengthened, and China should enhance its discourse power and rule-making power in the international community, Xi said.</p>
<p>A blockchain industry ecology should be created and the technology integration should be accelerated for frontier information technologies such as AI, big data and the Internet of Things, Xi pointed out. Deep integration between the blockchain and the real economy should also be promoted to solve the problems of financing for small- and medium-sized firms, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the development of blockchain technology should be guided.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has been lackluster since it was intertwined with initial coin offerings (ICO) and virtual currency.</p>
<p>Chinese authorities ordered a ban on ICO in 2017 and stopped direct bitcoin-yuan trading as the rapidly expanding market spawned concerns over financial risks. &#8220;Since then, we can see that some tech giants, including BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent), have downplayed their research and development in the area, but some small private firms are still moving ahead,&#8221; Cao noted.</p>
<p>China has been in close cooperation with the world&#8217;s leading blockchain community, mainly found in Europe, Cao said.</p>
<p>China launched a nationwide blockchain-based service network last week, aiming to improve the layout of the blockchain sector and serve the development of smart cities and the digital economy.</p>
<p>NASDAQ-listed Chinese desktop software and blockchain-related company Xunlei saw its shares surge by 47 percent during Friday&#8217;s trading as of press time.</p>

<p>At the ongoing 6th<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1078509.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Internet Conference</a> (WIC) in Wuzhen, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, a network affairs coordinator with China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry said the cyber security issue should not be politicized.</p>
<p>Wang Lei, with the Foreign Ministry, said Monday the issue is purely technical and has nothing to do with &#8220;governance models,&#8221; Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>Wang said other countries have exaggerated the so-called 5G supply chain security issue in an attempt to associate it with &#8220;governance models.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, problems arise with supply chain security during the development and evolution of information and communication technology, and is not a new problem solely unique to 5G.</p>
<p>The PRISM program leaked by<br />
<a href="http://backup.globaltimes.cn/SPECIALCOVERAGE/EdwardSnowden.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Snowden</a> in 2013 disclosed the largest undifferentiated cyber espionage operations conducted by western countries, which proves cyber security has no relation with governance models, Wang emphasized.</p>
<p>Wang also added that China hopes international standards on supply chain security would be researched and formulated jointly on a multilateral platform, based on justice, fairness, and non-discrimination.</p>

<p>Southeast Asian governments are banding together to take on global tech giants on issues including &#8220;fake news&#8221; and taxation, marking a new stage in the region&#8217;s approach to the Internet&#8217;s explosive growth.</p>
<p>The stakes are high both for the governments, which are counting on the digital economy to drive growth and innovation amid domestic political tensions, and the companies, which view Southeast Asia&#8217;s social-media-loving population of 641 million as a key growth market.</p>
<p>The new initiatives, which have not previously been reported, include an effort by Indonesia to join forces with Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines in demanding action from Google, Facebook and other companies on content regulation and tax policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, we are 80 percent of the region,&#8221; Indonesian communications minister Rudiantara said. Indonesia is already preparing legislation requiring tech companies with online services to pay value-added tax on local sales, even when they are booked offshore.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thailand&#8217;s telecom regulator, in a late-August meeting with regional counterparts, proposed that all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a>) require internet and streaming video firms to set up domestic &#8220;verification centers&#8221; to combat fake news.</p>
<p>Thailand also urged discussion of how to demand &#8220;economic contributions&#8221; from internet firms, whether through taxes or fees, according to a copy of a speech seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>The council of ASEAN telecoms regulators has accepted Thailand&#8217;s proposal for the centers, and a separate document with guidelines for economic contribution is expected to be formally adopted at the November ASEAN summit, a source in the Thai regulatory agency with knowledge of the talks said.</p>
<p>&#8220;ASEAN as a group gives us enough leverage, and our combined user base on services like Facebook is big enough to lend us negotiating power,&#8221; the source said.</p>
<p>The initiatives reflect widespread concern that Internet services, to which most people in the region have gained access only in the past few years, are fanning ethnic and religious animosities while avoiding paying their fair share.</p>
<p>Activist groups are nervous about the potential for institutionalized censorship. According to Freedom House&#8217;s 2018 Net Freedom survey, all Southeast Asian countries rank as either not free or partly free.</p>
<p>Emilie Pradichit, director of the Thailand-based Manushya Foundation, which advocates for online rights, told Reuters that governments in the region could use the label &#8220;fake news&#8221; to target dissidents. She called on companies to resist such attempts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the governments should themselves not use untrue information to achieve goals that are to their advantage, and private sector organizations, such as Facebook, should take the lead in protecting netizens&#8217; online freedom,&#8221; Pradichit said.</p>
<p>The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), which counts internet giants Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter and messaging app Line among its members, said ASEAN risks hurting the digital economy unless the new policies are &#8220;right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The potential of the region&#8217;s digital economy â€¦ will likely be blunted by overregulation or indiscriminate taxes and fees,&#8221; AIC director Jeff Paine said, urging governments to focus on &#8220;industry partnerships and collaborations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consensus disputed</p>
<p>It is not yet clear what level of support the new proposals enjoy and how they might be implemented in coming months.</p>
<p>Indonesia&#8217;s plan follows its successful effort to get Alphabet Inc&#8217;s Google to pay taxes on Indonesia-related advertising revenue booked at its Asia headquarters in Singapore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other countries asked me how we were able to achieve that, so I offered to them that they [could] piggyback off Indonesia to deal with the platforms,&#8221; Rudiantara said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said he also persuaded social media giants Telegram and Tik-Tok to establish content monitoring teams in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Rudiantara is now planning a &#8220;three letter system&#8221; wherein if a platform fails to respond to three government requests to engage on an issue, he&#8217;ll ban them. The proposal to neighboring countries includes a shared channel to communicate with the companies.</p>
<p>The Thai regulator wants to require internet companies to set up and fund &#8220;verification centers&#8221; in each Southeast Asian country.</p>
<p>Singapore has already passed a complex &#8220;fake news&#8221; law requiring internet companies to label or remove content deemed untrue.</p>
<p>The Thai proposal aims to ensure that companies take quick action on fake news and fake accounts. Facebook, Twitter and Google&#8217;s YouTube all have elaborate policies on what is allowed on their platforms and generally ban fake accounts, deceptive practices and hate speech. Content that is simply false, however, is usually allowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said they already have a fast process to tackle issues, but we insisted it&#8217;s still too slow,&#8221; said Takorn Tantasith, secretary general of Thailand&#8217;s National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission.</p>
<p>Officials in Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines said they support the verification center plan, saying fake news was a core national concern.</p>
<p>Philippines communications technology undersecretary Eliseo Rio said the country&#8217;s authorities are also working on a &#8220;one-stop&#8221; content-reviewing mechanism, where if one country decides something is disinformation, the company would remove it altogether and not just block it locally.</p>
<p>&#8220;The individual governments can conclude these are fake,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Rights watchdogs have warned that media freedom is declining in the Philippines, with several officials accused of propagating disinformation campaigns against opponents.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the regulators&#8217; proceedings, however, said support for the verification centers was not unanimous across Asia.</p>
<p>Three executives at targeted companies said they didn&#8217;t believe the idea would work, in part because it includes a wide range of global companies.</p>
<p>Facebook, Line Corp, Amazon, Netflix and Walt Disney were among those that attended a meeting in August with regulators to discuss the proposal.</p>
<p>Google and Netflix declined to comment, while Amazon, Facebook, Line and Walt Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Both Singapore and Indonesia already plan to impose GST taxes on foreign companies offering digital services, and talks are ongoing among Southeast Asian regulators for a region-wide effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Missing income is also a problem, and we asked for their cooperation on this too,&#8221; Takorn said.</p>
