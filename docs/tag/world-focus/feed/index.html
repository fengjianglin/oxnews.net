<p>&nbsp;Cuba hopes to generate a quarter of its energy needs from renewable sources over the next decade, an industry official said on Thursday. </p>
<p>The government&#8217;s Renewable Energy Development Program aims to raise clean energy output from today&#8217;s 4 percent to 24 percent by 2030, said Tatiana Amaran, general director of electricity at the Ministry of Energy and Mines. </p>
<p><center><br />

(Xinhua/Joaquin Hernandez)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The plan focuses on solar power, but other alternative sources have also been prioritized, including bioelectric plants linked to the sugar industry, wind farms and hydraulic power facilities, said Amaran. </p>
<p>Cuban authorities are courting foreign investment in this area by offering incentives and tax breaks. </p>
<p>They also implemented new legal norms, which took effect Thursday, to allow businesses and households to sell any surplus energy they generate from solar panels to the state-run Electrical Union. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cuba now gets 96 percent of its power from fossil fuels, but it has made headway in green energy. Between January and October, it generated 687,000 megawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydropower, solar, cane and non-cane biomass, saving 178,000 tons of fossil fuel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Iraqi Independent High Commission for Human Rights (IHCHR) said on Thursday that a total of 31 demonstrators were killed and more than 1,000 others wounded during the past three days of anti-government protests in capital Baghdad and southern provinces. </p>
<p>A statement by IHCHR said that &#8220;the commission&#8217;s teams have registered, during the period from Nov. 26 to 28, the use of excessive force by the security forces, leaving 25 protesters killed in Dhi Qar province, four in Najaf province and two in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.&#8221; </p>
<p>IHCHR also expressed its deep concern about the high number of casualties among both the demonstrators and the security forces during the three days due to the violence and the use of weapons, as well as the burning of many public and private properties, including the Iranian consulate in Najaf, some 160 km south of Baghdad, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry condemned in a statement the attack by some demonstrators on the Iranian consulate in Najaf on Wednesday night. </p>
<p>The ministry said the purpose behind burning the Iranian consulate is &#8220;to harm the historical relations between Iraq and Iran, as well as with the rest of the world states whose missions are working in Iraq.&#8221; </p>
<p>It reaffirmed its warning that there are some persons who want to derail the demonstrations by distorting the fair demands of the demonstrators. </p>
<p>The Iraqi ministry affirms that &#8220;the diplomatic missions operating in Iraq are highly respected,&#8221; and what happened to the Iranian consulate &#8220;does not represent the Iraq&#8217;s official point of view.&#8221; </p>
<p>Many protesters accuse neighboring Iran of interfering in Iraq&#8217;s internal affairs. </p>
<p>Mass demonstrations have continued in the capital Baghdad and other cities in central and southern Iraq since early October, demanding comprehensive reform, accountability for corruption, improvement of public services and job opportunities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Iraqi security forces cracked down on anti-government protesters in the strife-torn south on Thursday, leaving 22 people dead in a bloody escalation hours ­after the torching of an Iranian consulate.</p>
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, as commander in chief of the armed forces, dispatched military chiefs to several restive provinces to&nbsp;&#8220;restore order,&#8221; the military said in a statement.</p>
<p>Iraq&#8217;s capital and its south have been torn by the worst street unrest since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, as a youth-dominated protest movement has vented their fury at their government and its backers in neighboring Iran.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday protesters burnt down the Iranian consulate in the city of Najaf, yelling &#8220;Victory to Iraq!&#8221; and &#8220;Iran out!&#8221; in an attack condemned by Tehran which voiced its &#8220;disgust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iraq&#8217;s death toll in the street clashes since early October has surpassed 360 with more than 15,000 wounded according to an AFP tally, as authorities are not releasing updated or precise figures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protesters burning tires and throwing rocks and petrol bombs have clashed with security forces unleashing tear gas, rubber coated bullets and live rounds.</p>
<p>Demonstrators across the country have blamed Iran, Iraq&#8217;s powerful eastern neighbor, for propping up the very government they seek to topple.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, streets in Najaf were largely deserted due to the curfew, with public servants told to stay home.</p>
<p>Iran meanwhile demanded Iraq take decisive action against the protesters, with Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi condemning the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iran has officially communicated its disgust to the Iraq Ambassador in Tehran,&#8221; he said in comments carried by Iran&#8217;s state news agency IRNA.</p>

Photo: IC</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />North Korea fired two &#8220;unidentified projectiles&#8221; on Thursday &#8211; the Thanksgiving holiday in the US &#8211; Seoul said, as nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington remain deadlocked.</p>
<p>The projectiles were fired eastwards from South Hamgyong Province and came down in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, South Korea&#8217;s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.</p>
<p>They added that the launch was carried out at 16:59 pm ­local time (08:59 GMT) &#8211; or the early hours on the east coast of the US, during one of the country&#8217;s biggest annual holidays.</p>
<p>It was also one day short of the two-year anniversary of North Korea&#8217;s first test of its Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say is capable of reaching the entire US mainland.</p>
<p>Pyongyang is banned from firing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday&#8217;s launch was the latest in a series of violations.</p>
<p>&#8220;North Korea&#8217;s repeated launches of ballistic missiles are a serious defiance to not only our country but also the international community,&#8221; he told reporters in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s launch came after Pyongyang fired what it called a &#8220;super-large multiple rocket launcher&#8221; system last month, and the JCS said the latest devices were presumed to be of a similar type. They flew 380 kilometers and reached a maximum altitude of 97 kilometers, the JCS added.</p>
<p>Nuclear negotiations between the US and North Korea have been at a standstill since the Hanoi summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un broke up in February, and Pyongyang has since demanded Washington change its approach by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Last month Pyongyang also claimed to have tested a &#8220;new type&#8221; of submarine-launched ballistic missile &#8211; a potential strategic game changer.</p>
<p>Trump has played down the recent launches, repeatedly pointing to North Korea&#8217;s moratorium on nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches as foreign policy successes for him.</p>
<p>Trump and Kim adopted a vaguely worded statement on the &#8220;complete denuclearization of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a>&#8221; at their first summit in Singapore in June 2018, but little progress has since been made.</p>
<p>North Korea is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs and lifting some of them was a key demand in Hanoi.</p>
<p>In June Trump and Kim agreed to restart working-level talks during a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone dividing the peninsula and the two sides met in Sweden in October, only for Pyongyang to walk away.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Seoul and Washington said they would postpone planned joint military exercises to ease diplomacy with North Korea, an announcement Pyongyang dismissed.</p>

<p>The new president of the European Central Bank (ECB) Christine Lagarde signed here on Wednesday euro banknotes, vowing to nurture and sustain European citizens&#8217; trust in the single currency.</p>
<p>With currently 23 billion banknotes in circulation with a value of 1.26 trillion euros &#8212; a third of which are being used outside the euro area, the world&#8217;s second largest reserve currency has been playing a role in bringing Europe closer together, fostering a common identity and a sense of shared destiny in the currency bloc.</p>
<p>&#8220;It serves as the most tangible symbol of European integration, a process which has brought peace, freedom and prosperity to our continent,&#8221; Lagarde said at the signing ceremony which is customary ritual for the beginning of each ECB presidency.</p>
<p>Among ECB&#8217;s tasks such as implementing monetary policy, directly supervising more than 100 significant banks, &#8220;it is banknotes that are perhaps the most visible task for many European citizens,&#8221; said Lagarde.</p>
<p>&#8220;These banknotes are part of our economy, our identity and our culture,&#8221; she underlined, adding that the ECB has an immense responsibility to ensure that people maintain their trust in them.</p>
<p>As the ECB&#8217;s fourth president, Lagarde embarked on her eight-year term on Nov. 1, 2019.</p>
<p>Legally, both the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area have the right to issue euro banknotes. In practice, however, only the national central banks physically issue and withdraw euro banknotes. (one euro currently equals to 1.10 U.S. dollars)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Colombian President Ivan Duque on Wednesday lauded the signing of a contract with APCA Transmimetro, a Chinese railway construction consortium, to build the first subway line in its capital Bogota.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bogota has been dreaming of this for decades. Today we take another step and I would say that it is the most important, the signing of the contract,&#8221; said Duque.</p>
<p>&#8220;The formal construction of the subway starts now. The transformation of our capital starts now. The largest investment in the history of the city starts now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Presiding over the signing of the deal at the presidential headquarters in Bogota, Duque said that the project was set to further China-Colombia collaboration in infrastructure development.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure that the successful construction of Bogota&#8217;s subway will open frontiers to more projects,&#8221; he said, noting that the event coincided with the coming 40th anniversary of bilateral ties.</p>
<p>He also said that during a recent visit to China, he and Chinese officials spoke of the importance of &#8220;having more Chinese companies want to come to Colombia to invest in infrastructure projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the European Investment Bank are also participating in the project, which is expected to generate some 60,000 jobs, according to Duque.</p>

<p>A total of 1,335 fresh recruits joined the Afghan National Army after completing military training at the army&#8217;s Kabul Military Training Center (KMTC), a military source said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The latest graduation came as Afghan security forces have intensified security operations against Taliban militants and Islamic State (IS) fighters, who have been attempting to take territory and consolidate their positions in the countryside ahead of winter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The freshly graduated soldiers, who have undergone a 12-week training course at the KMTC received certificates at the ceremony Wednesday morning, and would be deployed at the countryside to serve their people,&#8221; Capt. Barat Ali Rizae from KMTC told Xinhua.</p>
<p>The Afghan security forces remain in control of most of Afghanistan&#8217;s population centers and all of 34 provincial capitals, but Taliban insurgents hold large portions of rural areas, staging coordinated large-scale attacks against Afghan cities and districts occasionally.</p>
<p>In the series of the Afghan military training process, a total of 1,550 soldiers and military officers also graduated and joined the army rank late last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s main opposition ­Labour party on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of plotting a &#8220;toxic&#8221; deal with US President Donald Trump to allow US pharmaceutical companies access to the state health service.</p>
<p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn held up what he said were 451 pages of previously secret documents that proved Johnson was seeking to put the ­National Health Service (NHS) on the table in a post-<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a> trade deal.</p>
<p>Britain goes to the polls on December 12, with Johnson hoping to secure a majority to be able to push through his divorce deal to take the country out of the European Union.</p>
<p>The funding and running of the NHS is a recurring election topic. Corbyn had previously obtained a redacted version of the document, which Johnson said was &#8220;an absolute invention.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Labour leader said the unredacted version catalogued six meetings between US and UK officials since 2017, detailing &#8220;what they [the Conservatives] don&#8217;t want you to know.&#8221; &#8220;The US is demanding that our NHS is on the table in negotiations for a toxic deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NHS was set up in 1948 under a Labour government, promising free healthcare for all &#8220;from cradle to the grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Labour has historically been its staunchest defenders and repeatedly warned the Conservatives have an agenda to introduce privatisation which would end free healthcare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The World Bank provided a grant of 52.5 million U.S. dollars for an Afghan Gas Project that will provide sustainable supply of natural gas to independent power producers in northern Afghan region, the agency reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Gas Project will provide direct financing and technical assistance for the construction, operation and maintenance of a gas pipeline from Shiberghan to Mazar-i-Sharif and a new natural gas desulfurization amine plant, according to a press release.</p>
<p>The project will also help in establishment of a strong institutional, regulatory, and contract management framework based on the principles of good governance in the gas sector, the release added.</p>
<p>&#8220;By investing in critical gas infrastructure and developing a strong foundation for good governance in the gas sector, the project will improve Afghanistan&#8217;s energy supply, which is currently critically low, and contribute to poverty reduction,&#8221; Henry Kerali, World Bank country director for Afghanistan, was quoted in the release as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project is one element of the World Bank Group&#8217;s broader support for improved energy access in Afghanistan, as part of an ongoing commitment to help developing countries extend access to reliable, affordable and sustainable energy for their citizens,&#8221; the press release read.</p>
<p>The Afghan Ministry of Mines and Petroleum will lead the overall implementation of the project in close coordination with other government agencies, including the Afghanistan Gas Enterprise, and the Afghanistan Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, according to the release.</p>
