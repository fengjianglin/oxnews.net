<p>An international team led by Chinese scientists has discovered a new specimen of a tiny raptor in a 100-million-year-old amber from north Myanmar.</p>
<p>The discovery shows the diversity of birds in the dinosaur age and has revealed the evolution of feathers.</p>
<p>The team led by Xing Lida, a paleontologist from China University of Geosciences in Beijing, has discovered a series of ambers that preserve enantiornithine fossils and have enriched people&#8217;s knowledge of the evolution of ancient birds and enantiornithine, according to a press release Xing sent to the Global Times.</p>
<p>Fossils remains discovered this time preserved some skeletons and skin of a bird&#8217;s foot. Its overall shape and the curvature of the preserved ungual sheath strongly suggest it was an arboreal bird, Xing told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The prominent plantar pads and papillose plantar surface are related to gripping substrates and prey. The combination of strongly padded, robust digits with elongated claws was most commonly found in extant raptorial birds, which may suggest the bird was a small aerial insectivore.</p>
<p>The ambers came from Hukawng Valley, a mountainous region of Myanmar with high rainfall and many rivers. Local language refers to it as &#8220;the place where demons live.&#8221; Ambers discovered in the region, which date back 100 million years, record its unique ecosystem in ancient times.</p>
<p>The team had earlier discovered strange-shaped feathers that have an open central shaft. The cross-section of the shaft is in the shape of the letter C, not the letter O as extant birds. C-shaped feathers were not as good for flying as O-shaped ones because they were less sturdy, but they were lighter than O-shaped feathers and more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>The newly discovered fossils connect such feathers with enantiornithine as a previous discovery contained only feathers without skeletons.</p>
<p>Xing&#8217;s team discovered the world&#8217;s first raptor fossils in ambers and wings of ancient birds in 2016. They have also discovered snakes and frogs in ambers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />Chinese marine research vessel Haiyang 6 (Ocean 6) has completed its deep-sea exploration mission in the Western Pacific ocean after 122 days and 35,000 km at sea. </p>
<p>The vessel, which is under the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey (GMGS), Ministry of Natural Resources, returned to Guangzhou on Wednesday. </p>
<p>According to the GMGS, the mission has carried out a comprehensive geological and geophysical survey in some areas of the Northwest Pacific Ocean and obtained sediment samples rich in rare earth elements, laying a foundation for the scientific research on deep-sea ecosystems and evaluation of new resources. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the expedition team also carried out the annual investigation in the contract area of cobalt-rich crusts. </p>
<p>China signed a cobalt-rich crust mining contract with the International Seabed Authority in April 2014. The crust is located in the seamount area of the Northwest Pacific Ocean, covering some 3,000 square km. </p>
<p>China is entitled to survey the area and conduct experiments in mining and smelting for 15 years, is obliged to hand over two-thirds of the area within 10 years and provide training to technicians from other developing nations. </p>
<p>He Gaowen, a GMGS engineer, said that during the mission, the researchers optimized the performance of the acoustic sensor system of in-situ thickness measurement, which enables precise detection of the cobalt-rich crusts and improves the stability and efficiency of deep sea shallow drilling. </p>
<p>The Haiyang 6 is the first modern comprehensive geophysical survey ship designed and built independently in China, whose basic design inspired many marine scientific survey vessels in China. </p>
<p>Since 2009, the vessel has carried out 55 missions to the South China Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Antarctic waters. </span></p>

<p>China&#8217;s research icebreaker Xuelong, or Snow Dragon, has returned to Shanghai after a recent complete overhaul, ready for the country&#8217;s upcoming 36th Antarctic expedition, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources Monday. </p>
<p>The vessel will set off on Oct. 22, together with Xuelong 2, China&#8217;s first domestically built polar icebreaker. </p>
<p>The overhaul, started in May at Jiangnan Shipyard Group in Shanghai, is the third major maintenance of the vessel since 2007. There were nearly 400 repair works, mainly focusing on the hull, coating, turbines, electrical equipment, ship pipes, air cooling and outfitting systems. </p>
<p>After the extensive maintenance and select renovation work, Xuelong&#8217;s hull structures have been strengthened and its research equipment has been further improved, the ministry said. </p>
<p>China bought Xuelong from Ukraine in 1993 and upgraded it into a polar research vessel. It can break ice as thick as 1.2 meters at a speed of 1.5 knots. </p>
<p>Since it first visited polar regions in 1994, the icebreaker has conducted 22 Antarctic expeditions and nine Arctic expeditions, developing Arctic shipping routes and setting a group of navigation records. It reached as far as 88.26 degrees north latitude and 77.35 degrees south latitude. </p>
<p>On July 11, China&#8217;s first self-built polar icebreaker Xuelong 2 was delivered in Shanghai, which will boost China&#8217;s polar research and expedition capabilities, according to the ministry.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">A student from the Department of Geology carries out research on a fossil from the Qingjiang biota in Northwest University in Xi&#8217;an, capital of northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province, April 8, 2019. File photo:Xinhua</p>
<p>Scientists have found traces of early life in Western Australia&#8217;s (WA) famous 3.5-billion-year-old rock formations, representing a giant breakthrough in the understanding of how life formed on Earth.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of News South Wales (UNSW) have for the first time found organic matter located in a group of fossilised stromatolites known as the Dresser Formation in WA&#8217;s Pilbara region.</p>
<p>Stromatolites are a type of rock formation formed by living organisms such as cyanobacteria and while it was previously suspected that the ancient Dresser Formation was produced by living organisms, it remained unproven &#8212; until now.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an exciting discovery &#8212; for the first time, we&#8217;re able to show the world that these stromatolites are definitive evidence for the earliest life on Earth,&#8221; lead researcher Dr Raphael Baumgartner from UNSW said.</p>
<p>Ever since their discovery in 1980 it has been hotly contested whether the Dresser Formation actually were of biogenic origin, and therefore the earliest signs of life on earth.</p>
<p>To prove the theory, Baumgartner and his team took drill core samples of the stromatolites, beyond the weathered exterior to where the rock&#8217;s microbial past was far better preserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this study, I spent a lot of time in the lab, using micro-analytical techniques to look very closely at the rock samples, to prove our theory once and for all,&#8221; Baumgartner said.</p>
<p>What they uncovered was that the stromatolites were essentially composed of pyrite &#8212; also known as &#8216;fool&#8217;s gold&#8217; &#8212; within which there were &#8220;exceptionally preserved coherent filaments and strands that are typically remains of microbial biofilms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember the night at the electron microscope where I finally figured out that I was looking at biofilm remains &#8212; I think it was around 11pm when I had this &#8216;eureka&#8217; moment, and I stayed until three or four o&#8217;clock in the morning &#8212; I was so excited, I totally lost track of time,&#8221; Baumgartner said.</p>
<p>The breakthrough contributes to growing evidence from the Dresser Formation about how life on earth may have originated and is now informing current searches for life on Mars, with NASA experts travelling to WA last month to learn about this unique site.</p>
<p>&#8220;This represents a major advance in our knowledge of these rocks, in the science of early life investigations generally, and &#8212; more specifically &#8212; in the search for life on Mars. We now have a new target and new methodology to search for ancient life traces,&#8221; Director of Australian Centre for Astrobiology at UNSW, Professor Van Kranendonk said.</p>
