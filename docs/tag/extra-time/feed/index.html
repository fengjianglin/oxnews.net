<p>Australia captain Tim Paine has blasted England all-rounder Ben Stokes for taking a &#8220;cheap shot&#8221; at David Warner, claiming he was using the controversial opening batsman to spike sales of his new book.</p>
<p>In his book, which is being serialiszd in a British newspaper, he claims Warner&#8217;s sledging motivated Stokes during his match-winning heroics in the third Ashes Test this year.</p>
<p>Stokes&#8217;s incredible unbeaten 135 steered England to a record run chase and thrilling one-wicket win to square the five-match series at 1-1.</p>
<p>&#8220;He just wouldn&#8217;t shut up for most of my time out there,&#8221; Stokes said of Warner, who insists he has reformed and is no longer the brash character who was banned for a year over a ball-tampering scandal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could accept it from just about any other opponent. Truly. Not from him, though,&#8221; Stokes added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The changed man he was adamant he&#8217;d become, the one that hardly said boo to a goose and even went as far as claiming he had been re-nicknamed &#8216;Humble&#8217; by his Australia teammates, had disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paine disputed the characterisation and was adamant Warner did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Asked if it was a cheap shot by Stokes, he replied, &#8220;Oh absolutely&#8230; I was obviously standing next to David the whole time [at first slip] and you are allowed to talk on the cricket field,&#8221; he told reporters on Sunday in Brisbane ahead of a Test series against Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;But by no means was he abusing him or sledging him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just seems to be a common trend in England that they like to use Davey&#8217;s name to spike book sales.&#8221;</p>
