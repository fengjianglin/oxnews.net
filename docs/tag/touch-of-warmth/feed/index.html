<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Inset: Zoo staff examine 2-month old Bei Bei Photo: IC</p>
<p>He was born in Washington DC and took his first steps in the US capital, but at age 4, it&#8217;s time to head &#8220;home&#8221; &#8211; to China.</p>
<p>Bei Bei, the last young panda living at the National Zoo, will leave Washington on Tuesday aboard a specially outfitted FedEx plane, as planned even before he took his first breath.</p>
<p>Such are the strict rules of &#8220;panda diplomacy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tearful goodbye</strong></p>
<p>In front of the zoo&#8217;s panda enclosure on a chilly day, schoolchildren in winter coats and hats line up to say farewell, many of them with signs reading &#8220;Bye bye Bei Bei.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Zoo &#8211; a branch of the venerable Smithsonian, the world&#8217;s largest museum and research complex &#8211; has organized a week of events to celebrate the departure of Bei Bei, which means &#8220;precious, treasure&#8221; in Chinese.</p>
<p>Kids can write postcards for the panda, which will go with him to China, watch zookeepers offer him special treats, attend Q&amp;A sessions with zoo personnel or just watch him play.</p>
<p>Through it all, Bei Bei&#8230; munches on bamboo.</p>
<p>Marty Dearie is one of Bei Bei&#8217;s keepers. He saw the male cub born in August 2015 on the &#8220;panda cam&#8221; &#8211; which is trained on the zoo&#8217;s pandas around the clock. Bei Bei, who now weighs a healthy 114 kilograms, lives with his parents, dad Tian Tian and mom Mei Xiang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our job has been to get him prepared for the trip to China from the moment he was born,&#8221; Dearie told AFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew that was coming &#8211; it&#8217;s part of the loan agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s &#8220;panda diplomacy&#8221; has evolved over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point in time, Beijing gave pandas to friendly nations, but now that the animals are considered &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, China lends pandas to zoos around the world.</p>
<p>Once a panda reaches the age of 4, he or she is repatriated to breed with other animals at sanctuaries in China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bei Bei&#8217;s siblings, brother Tai Shan and sister Bao Bao, have already been returned to China.</p>
<p>Tian Tian and Mei Xiang will remain at the National Zoo until at least December 2020, when a new deal would need to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Even though the conditions were always set in stone, Dearie is still heartbroken to see Bei Bei go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a very emotional person, I can admit to that,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure on the day of the move for Bei Bei, I&#8217;ll be in some tears.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Honey and sugarcane</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving a giant panda to another continent is no easy task.</p>
<p>For several weeks, Bei Bei&#8217;s keepers have been training him to sit in the crate in which he will travel to China on the nonstop 16-hour flight from Washington to Chengdu.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, we were able to close both doors and he sits in there comfortably,&#8221; says Dearie.</p>
<p>A keeper and a veterinarian will make the trip with Bei Bei. The National Zoo staff will prepare a special stash of treats for him &#8211; like most giant pandas, he eats constantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll probably be taking 15 or 20 kilos of bamboo with him at least. He&#8217;ll also get apples, sweet potatoes, carrots. We&#8217;ll probably take some sugarcane. There might be honey, biscuits,&#8221; Dearie explains.</p>
<p>FedEx is paying for the flight and the special outfitting of the Boeing 777 &#8211; called the &#8220;Panda Express&#8221; for the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bei Bei and his &#8216;luggage&#8217; will be the only shipment on the aircraft,&#8221; said FedEx spokeswoman Rae Lyn Rushing.</p>
<p>Both the public and his keepers have been enthralled with Bei Bei from the get-go: from his first steps, to an operation in 2016 to remove a lemon-sized chewed-up mass of bamboo from his intestines, to his departure.</p>
<p>The giant panda&#8217;s name was revealed at a naming ceremony in 2015 presided over by then US first lady Michelle Obama and Peng Liyuan, the wife of current Chinese President Xi Jinping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such baptisms are now a ritual at other zoos around the world &#8211; France&#8217;s first lady Brigitte Macron attended a similar ceremony with Chinese officials at the Beauval zoo when cub Yuan Meng was named.</p>
<p>Beyond being universally adored, pandas have become an &#8220;extremely successful&#8221; policy tool for China, according to Liselotte Odgaard, a visiting senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank who specializes in US-China-Europe relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a symbol of China&#8217;s history, its benevolence, its generosity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s also a lucrative policy tool &#8211; zoos pay China millions of dollars a year for their pandas, which bring in hordes of visitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a regular &#8220;panda business,&#8221; Odgaard says.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">The skyline at night of the Macao Special Administrative Region, China Photo: IC</p>
<p>The members of the choir who sang the &#8220;Song of the Seven Sons &#8211; Macao&#8221; to mark the Macao&#8217;s return to China reunited to sing the song again at the Ruins of St. Paul&#8217;s in Macao on Tuesday for the 20th anniversary of the event.</p>
<p>The hashtag for the choir&#8217;s reunion has earned almost 100 million views on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo as Chinese netizens shared their warm memories of the song on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was a child, it was very popular to copy lyrics, and one of them was the &#8216;Song of the Seven Sons.&#8217; At that time, I felt it was a beautiful song with a lovely melody, but I didn&#8217;t have a deeper understanding of the meaning behind it. Although 20 years have past, I was moved to tears while listening to the song again as the lyrics are so touching,&#8221; Liu Jianran, a 29-year-old civil servant in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Song of the Seven Sons&#8221; is a group of seven patriotic poems written by Wen Yiduo, a prominent Chinese poet and scholar, in 1925. Wen compared the seven ceded or leased areas in China, including the current Macao Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan Province, to seven children who were separated from the motherland.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never imagined that the poems could become songs because I thought song lyrics are supposed to have a certain rhyme. But when the song debuted at the Chinese New Year Gala of China Central Television (CCTV) in 1999, I was pleasantly surprised how they perfectly matched the melody and the words of the poem. I remembered the song was played everywhere in Beijing. &#8216;Do you know Macao has never been my real name? I have been away from you for too long, Mother. What they captured is my body, but my soul is always in your keep…'&#8221; said Wen Liming, grandson of Wen Yiduo, in an interview with CCTV 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really want to thank Mr. Wen for writing these words. They are easy to understand and sing, but also clearly explain the past and present of Macao. It works to enhance the sense of identity and belonging of Macao people to the motherland. In contrast, the general education in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has a big problem, and the rude behaviors of some young people there are really confusing and disappointing,&#8221; a netizen named Cardioid6 wrote on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
