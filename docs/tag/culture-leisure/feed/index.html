<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Fijian people perform a local dance to welcome tourists. Photo: Courtesy of Tourism Fiji </p>
<p>Tourism Fiji formalized its partnership with China&#8217;s Twitter-like social media platform Sina Weibo in Chengdu, Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province on November 21, aiming to attract more consumers from the Chinese market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji is one of the first Pacific countries to sign a<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Memorandum of Understanding with China. The country sent a delegation to Beijing to attend the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China is a very strategic market for us because it&#8217;s a market in which we see huge potential,&#8221; said Matthew Stoeckel, CEO of Tourism Fiji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is Fiji&#8217;s fourth largest source market. More than 50,000 Chinese visited the country in 2018, hitting a record high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Couples and families are now the top two target consumers of Fiji&#8217;s tourism campaign in China. Chartered flights from cities like Tianjin and Hangzhou are available to visitors during the Chinese New Year, which is a time of reunion for millions of Chinese families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji is now finding opportunities in second-tier cities like Chengdu. Chengdu ranked at the top as the best performing economy of any Chinese city, overtaking Shenzhen, according to an annual report recently released by the US-based think tank the Milken Institute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have noticed the economic growth in Southwest China,&#8221; said Vincent Zheng, regional manager of Greater China for Tourism Fiji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope cities like Chengdu can become engines for our future growth.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tell Fiji through stories</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese tourists account for 5.5 percent of Fiji&#8217;s tourism market share, following Australia, New Zealand and North American countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji now invests in China for the long-term, hoping for the market&#8217;s future growth, and is now building a brand profile in the market to help build awareness among Chinese customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tourism Fiji has worked with Chinese travel agencies, set up a development board in Shanghai and leveraged the power of social media to create more influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tourism Fiji&#8217;s Sina Weibo account has more than 80,000 followers. Around 70 percent of these followers are in their 20s and 30s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Visitors aged between 25-35 are the major demographic for Chinese tourists in Fiji, &#8221; said Zheng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young tourists demand more personalized and diversified experiences. To cater to this group&#8217;s needs, Tourism Fiji has launched a project with Sina Weibo to have young idol Luo Yunxi share his travel experiences in a video which has earned nearly 200 million views on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to vocalize our unique selling proposition and taglines about Fiji. It&#8217;s really not something tangible. It&#8217;s emotional and experiences you have,&#8221; said Stoeckel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think social media is a really great channel to introduce Fiji through stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of Sina Weibo users interested in traveling has reached almost 200 million, making them one of the biggest interest groups on the social media platform. The content shared on the platform has also changed from standardized travel guides to niche and in-depth articles on lesser-known destinations such as Fiji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approximately 127 million users published 4.9 billion posts related to travel in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Bula spirit&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Skydiving and snorkeling are the most popular activities among Chinese travelers. However, it&#8217;s the &#8221;<br />
<em>Bula</em> spirit&#8221; that distinguishes Fiji from other island countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Bula</em> is the word Fijians use when saying hello but it also means to wish others to have the energy of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You find the &#8216;<br />
<em>Bula</em> spirit&#8217; ubiquitously across Fiji,&#8221; said Stoeckel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everywhere you go, everyone will greet you with a heartfelt &#8216;<br />
<em>Bula</em>&#8216; and look you in the eyes. Trust me, you believe that is from the heart because it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fiji is now preparing for the second phase of its &#8220;Bulanaire&#8221; campaign next year, a word combining<br />
<em>Bula </em>with billionaire, which aims to celebrate those who are rich in happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Finding a balance</strong></p>
<p>Tourism is the pillar industry in Fiji, as it accounts for more than one-third of the country&#8217;s GDP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji seeks to maintain the sustainability of the tourism industry by combining business with charity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji now invites visitors to participate in protecting the environment such as restoring coral reefs and working on the rehabilitation of turtles and other animals to make tourism &#8220;a very positive force.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By combining environmental-friendly experiences with tourism, Fiji&#8217;s model could possibly attract more tourists, including Chinese tourists as it makes traveling more than a leisure time activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where Fiji stands alone is the experiences you have there. You arrive as a guest but many will see you as a family,&#8221; said Stoeckel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since its opening in 2009, the High Line in New York has become an iconic contemporary landmark. The elevated park on an abandoned railway track is decorated with flowers, plants, outdoor art installations and gives visitors a look at the city&#8217;s sublime skyline. Meanwhile, half a world away in the South Korean capital of Seoul, a similar elevated park opened in 2017. Unlike the High Line, it hasn&#8217;t been overcrowded by tourists yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Partially inspired by the High Line, Seoullo 7017, also known as the Seoul Skygarden, was constructed on a disused overpass that closed in 2015. According to an introduction from the city government, the word Seoullo means &#8220;a path towards Seoul.&#8221; The number 7017 combines the year 1970, when the overpass was built, and 2017, when the area was reborn. Stretching from Seoul Station Plaza to the north of Seoul Station, the park connects popular tourist sites across the city such as Myeongdong, Namdaemun Market and Namsan.</p>
<p>The part got its start from an international design competition to renew the overpass held from January to April in 2015. Dutch architect and landscaper Winy Maas came out on top with his design to make the park a place where &#8220;nature and humans can live side by side,&#8221; as described by Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon after its opening in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skygarden offers a living dictionary of plants which are part of the natural heritage of South Korea… They are planted in containers of different sizes and height and organized in groups of families. The families are ordered according to the Korean alphabet,&#8221; the designer told media.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides immersing oneself in the local flora, everyone is invited to try out the piano painted in blue and decorated with floral print. If you don&#8217;t feel up to playing, it&#8217;s equally nice to sit down and listen to other people try their hand at performing. While you sit on a bench, be sure to look for any signs, as some of them come with an introduction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wooden part of the bench was designed to reuse former pavement. Also, the under part of the bench is made from recycled materials from the former overpass to express the meaning of urban regeneration,&#8221; reads one label for a wooden bench with a bottom made from concrete.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Railroad park in Beijing</span></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for a High Line in Beijing, the closest you can come is probably Jiangfu Park. Located in the northeast part of the city close to the fifth ring, the park opened in 2008. Yet the park has only caught people&#8217;s attention in recent years as more and more bloggers, and sometimes celebrities, such as Chinese actress Guo Biting, have gone to the park to shoot photos alongside the park&#8217;s abandoned railroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Covering an area of 58 hectares, the park is blessed with serene scenic spots and far fewer visitors that other parks in Beijing. You may actually steal a moment of peace, hiding from hustle and bustle of the city by taking a stroll around the lakes or walking down the path in the grooves. However, around the park, beside one of the three venues of the China Railway Museum, there isn&#8217;t much to explore, as most buildings nearby are residential compounds or offices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is that, also in part inspired by the High Line, a nine-kilometer-long linear park will be created along the old tracks of the Jingzhang Railway in northern Beijing, media reported in April. Linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou, the original Jingzhang Railway, opened in 1909, was China&#8217;s first independently-built railway. To preserve and revitalize the icon of China&#8217;s modern industrial civilization, Chinese railway engineer Wang Mengshu proposed the idea of building the park in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the city planning department, with important historical sites along the tracks preserved, the park will run through the Haidian district and be redeveloped to provide more green areas and trails for walking and running. The park is expected to connect 26 communities and the eight nearby universities, benefiting 310,000 people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On September 15, the Wudaokou section of the park opened to the public. Stretching 800 meters and covering 1.7 hectares, the park is dotted with a great variety of plants. According to media reports, volunteers guides are there to teach children more about the plants in the park, while parent-child tree planting activities are also being held at the park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to embracing nature, visitors will also have the opportunity to walk through the history of the Jingzhang Railway. A bamboo-constructed 40-meter gallery in the park showcases photos and texts about the railway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city planning department also held international bidding for design plans for other sections of the park in October. Will this become Beijing&#8217;s version of the High Line, or even something better?&nbsp;</p>

<p>A total of 18 prizes of a regional competition were awarded Wednesday to the best articles as part of the celebration of the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Tunisia.</p>
<p>Many academics, researchers, artists, representatives of civil society as well as students of the Confucius Institute of Tunis took part in the award ceremony held at the headquarters of the Chinese Embassy in Tunis.</p>
<p>This competition includes three categories of prizes for the languages of Arabic, French and Chinese.</p>
<p>Among the jury of the competition are two members of the Tunisian Federation of Newspaper Directors and the Tunisia-China Friendship Association (TCFA), in addition to a diplomat from the Chinese embassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The objective is to provide a platform for exchanges that allow Tunisian and Chinese friends of all levels to actively contribute to the development of relations between China and Tunisia with their ideas and proposals,&#8221; said Chinese Ambassador to Tunisia Wang Wenbin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had received more than 100 articles, the contents of which are very widespread and formulate many suggestions for the development of our relationship in the future, and this has given us immense inspirations,&#8221; added the ambassador.</p>
<p>Ezzedine Ben Salah, member of the jury, revealed to the Xinhua News Agency that most of the candidate articles are of good quality, adding that many Tunisians know China and its diversity of customs and cultures perfectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some candidates have used precise figures in addition to ideas that can help promote bilateral investment between our two countries,&#8221; explained Ben Salah.</p>
<p>Representing the TCFA, Ezzeddine Jebali stressed that the content discovered through these articles has made it possible to get a close look at the great progress China-Tunisia bilateral ties have made over the past 55 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The New York Botanical Garden is rolling into a holiday season with its annual holiday train show, which features architectural replicas of the city&#8217;s Central Park &#8211; one of the most popular urban parks in the US.</p>
<p>Now in its 28th edition, the annual event transports visitors to a miniature metropolis as model trains zip through an enchanting display of more than 175 landmarks in New York, each re-created using items such as bark, lotus pods, acorns, cinnamon sticks and other natural materials.</p>
<p>Six replicas made their debut this year, which are Belvedere Castle, Bethesda Terrace, the Dairy, the Naumburg Bandshell and two graceful pedestrian bridges, according to Victoria Lewis, the botanical garden&#8217;s manager of interpretive content.</p>
<p>&#8220;In real life Bow Bridge is made of steel, but for our version, it&#8217;s twigs and willow bark,&#8221; said Lewis. Dating from 1862, the Bow Bridge is known for its subtle shape which is reminiscent of the bow of an archer or violinist.</p>
<p>The new miniature replicas are arrayed in a tableau with existing Central Park collection, including the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater and the Old Bandstand. In addition, famous New York buildings that are either next to the park or just inside it are on display, including the Plaza Hotel, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Rose Center for Earth and Space, which is part of the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s holiday train show is different from the ones in the previous years as it is held in a temporary exhibition space tailored just for the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show used to be held in the conservatory, the palm dome of which is under restoration.</p>
<p>Lewis said because the temperature is lower in the exhibition space this year compared to that of the conservatory, visitors will see more evergreen plants instead of tropical plants at the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has the effect of being more wintry and it really creates this wonderful indoor winter wonderland,&#8221; said Lewis.</p>
<p>In addition, more than 25 G-scale model trains and trolleys hum along a nearly half-a-mile-long track past re-creations of iconic sites from all five boroughs of New York City, the Hudson River Valley, and other locations in New York State.</p>
<p>The holiday train show has already started and will be running through January 26, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming latest episode of reality show<br />
<em>Encounter,</em> which will be made available on Tencent Video on Tuesday, will see Chinese musicians Aya, Tan Weiwei and Xiao He collect children&#8217;s folk songs in local dialects in Hangzhou and other neighboring areas in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passed down by word of mouth through the generations, children&#8217;s songs in local dialects are facing extinction due to rapid urbanization and social changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the show, the musicians seek out the original songs and then remake them&nbsp; to fit today&#8217;s modern times in order to remind people of the long-unheard voices of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second season of the show currently has a high rating of 7.6/10 on Chinese media review site Douban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s director Zhao Qi said that the second season, which kicked off on October 22, will &#8220;return to humanity itself.&#8221; The first season once raised questions about life and death, topics commonly discussed by many families.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at a New York City police department precinct to turn himself in to face multiple charges related to allegations of sexual assault on Friday. According to reports, Weinstein is facing charges of first-degree rape and third-degree rape in one case, and first-degree criminal sex act in another case. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>A New York judge has ruled that<br />
<em>The Sopranos</em> actress Annabella Sciorra is allowed to testify at fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s trial, court documents showed Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a decision filed late Tuesday, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke also denied a last-ditch attempt by Weinstein&#8217;s attorneys to have predatory sexual assault charges against their client dropped.</p>
<p>Weinstein &#8211; once one of the most powerful men in Hollywood &#8211; has pleaded not guilty to five charges of sexual assault relating to two women.</p>
<p>His trial is scheduled to start on January 6, 2020. He faces life in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>One of the women alleges Weinstein raped her in 2013, while the other claims he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006.</p>
<p>His lawyers had sought to prevent prosecutors from calling a third woman, who alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein over the winter of 1993-94, to give evidence.</p>
<p>Burke rejected their request.</p>
<p>The woman is not named in court documents but it widely understood to be Sciorra, 59.</p>
<p>She helped trigger the #MeToo movement in October 2017 when she told The New Yorker magazine that Weinstein raped her at her home in Manhattan in 1993.</p>
<p>Weinstein, 67, cannot be charged with raping Sciorra because the statute of limitations has expired. Prosecutors hope that her giving evidence as a corroborating witness will strengthen their case.</p>
<p>Weinstein has been accused of harassment and assault by more than 80 women, including stars such as Ashley Judd.</p>
<p>The co-founder of Miramax and producer of<br />
<em>Pulp Fiction</em>, has always insisted his sexual relationships were consensual.</p>

<p>A 49-carat diamond which analysts estimate to be worth up to $12 million was among over a dozen jewel-encrusted items snatched from a German state museum in a spectacular heist, the museum confirmed Wednesday.</p>
<p>Publishing a list of the pieces taken in Monday&#8217;s brazen raid, the Green Vault museum at Dresden&#8217;s royal palace said the items stolen included a sword whose hilt is encrusted with nine large and 770 smaller diamonds, and a shoulder-piece which contains the famous 49-carat Dresden white diamond.</p>
<p>Eleven pieces were removed completely, while individual parts of a further three items were also missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dresden White is one of the most precious jewels in the collection of former Saxon ruler August the Strong.</p>
<p>Tobias Kormind, managing director of the diamond retailer 77Diamonds, told AFP that it could be worth up to $10 or $12 million, adding that thieves would have &#8220;hit the jackpot&#8221; if they did take it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of the diamonds would have been in themselves extra special except for the one large Dresden White,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 49-carat diamond was cut in the early 18th century and bought at great expense by August the Strong, then Elector of Saxony, in 1728.</p>
<p>In dramatic CCTV footage released by police on Monday, one of the suspects can be seen using an axe to break into the display case containing three diamond jewelry collections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thieves launched their audacious raid in the early hours of Monday morning, instigating a partial powercut before breaking through a window protected by iron bars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They then headed straight for the display cabinet in what police said was a &#8220;targeted and premeditated crime.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police said Wednesday that after studying the video material, they now believed that there were four perpetrators in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having called for witnesses to come forward earlier in the week, the investigative commission said they had received 205 tip-offs from the public by Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dresden police chief Joerg Kubiessa told broadcaster ZDF that a &#8220;criminal gang&#8221; may be behind the robbery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dresden police said they were also in contact with colleagues in Berlin to explore possible connections to a similar heist in the capital two years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, a 100-kilogram, 24-karat giant gold coin was stolen from Berlin&#8217;s Bode Museum. Four men with links to a notorious Berlin gang were later arrested and put on trial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coin has never been recovered, and fears are growing that the Dresden treasures will also remain lost forever.</p>
<p>With Germany reeling from what Bild and Handelsblatt newspapers called &#8220;the biggest art heist in modern history,&#8221; questions were raised about how the thieves were able to break in so easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;How safe are Germany&#8217;s museums really?&#8221; asked regional broadcaster MDR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, the director of Dresden&#8217;s state art collections Marion Ackermann defended the security measures at the Green Vault, saying that around 8 million euros ($8.8 million) were spent on security ever year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was announced on Wednesday that Chinese crime drama<br />
<em>The Wild Goose Lake</em> will hit the mainland cinemas on December 6.</p>
<p>A trailer for the film, which stars Chinese mainland actor Hu Ge and Gwei Lun-mei from the island of Taiwan, was released on the film&#8217;s official Sina Weibo account on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The trailer briefly shows a fugitive man Zhou Zhennan (Hu) as he tries to escape the police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a press conference in Suzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, on Tuesday, Hu said that &#8220;The director was patient and gave me a lot of guidance, but the shoot was not easy since the director wanted to dig deeper into the performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film premiered at the 72nd annual<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/983300.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cannes Film Festival</a> in competition on May 18. It currently has a 7.6/10 score on Chinese media review site Douban.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a movie, with a unique personal style full of innovations! Each shot of the lens is carefully crafted. Most of the story was shot at night and the chases, fighting and gun battles in this gangster drama also have their own unique expressions. I like this ridiculous story with blurred love and black humor,&#8221; one netizen commented on Douban.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Russian cheeses on sale at a shop Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Elvira Kovtun made her first cheese in a pot in her kitchen four years ago.</p>
<p>Kovtun, a housewife and mostly self-taught cheesemaker, became so good that she and her husband decided to turn her passion into a business.</p>
<p>Last month, the high-school sweethearts and parents of three became the first Russians to win a gold prize at the World Cheese Awards, with their &#8220;Peshernyi&#8221; hard cheese taking the honor at the industry&#8217;s equivalent of the Oscars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think this was possible,&#8221; Elvira&#8217;s husband, Vyacheslav Kovtun, told AFP at their small creamery in the industrial town of Korolyov, outside Moscow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I believe in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family&#8217;s success shows how far Russia&#8217;s cheese-making industry has come since President Vladimir Putin banned Western food imports in 2014 in a tit-for-tat measure over the<br />
<a href="http://backup.globaltimes.cn/SPECIALCOVERAGE/Ukrainecrisis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukraine crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Many Russians had developed a taste for French and Italian cheeses prior to sanctions, and Moscow seized the opportunity to put in place an &#8220;import substitution&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>This supported local entrepreneurs trying to set up businesses to replace imported goods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results were often mixed, however, with many customers complaining of the higher price and often inferior quality of the Russian-made products.</p>
<p>But dairy farming and cheese-making have become a bright spot.</p>
<p>According to Russia&#8217;s National Association of Milk Producers, production of cheese and cheese products grew by a third to 670,000 tons a year between 2013 and 2018.</p>
<p>Last week Putin confessed he was &#8220;somewhat worried&#8221; when the first punitive measures were introduced, but the events of the past few years proved that the sanctions had worked to &#8220;our economy&#8217;s advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Ground-breaking&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of artisanal creameries have cropped up across the country and some, like the Kovtuns, are winning top marks from international critics.</p>
<p>Elvira and Vyacheslav, who are both 40 and opened their Korolyov creamery in 2018, had not expected success to come so quickly.</p>
<p>When Elvira called her husband to break the news of the award last month, she was sobbing, Vyacheslav said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got scared. I thought something terrible had happened,&#8221; he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Their creamery&#8217;s website crashed from interest after the awards were announced and the winning cheese sold out until April 2020.</p>
<p>More than 3,800 cheeses from 42 countries were in competition at this year&#8217;s World Cheese Awards in Bergamo, Italy, where products are awarded with supergold, gold, silver or bronze prizes.</p>
<p>At last year&#8217;s competition no Russian entries were recognized but this year the Kovtuns&#8217; Cheese &amp; Beer creamery and three other Russian cheesemakers won a total of nine awards.</p>
<p>John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food which organizes the competition, said the Kovtuns had put Russia on the international cheese map.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our gold winners are some of the best in the world and only a small percentage of entries do this well,&#8221; Farrand said, praising their Peshernyi cheese for &#8220;delivering a true sense of terroir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Russia&#8217;s lack of the cheese-making heritage of France or Italy could in some ways be an advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Free from the pressures of tradition, the country&#8217;s artisans can innovate and produce something ground-breaking and unique,&#8221; Farrand said in written comments to AFP.</p>
<p>Elvira said she spent several years perfecting Peshernyi and the recipe is a closely guarded secret.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Cheese fever&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>With its nutty and fruity hints, Peshernyi matures for seven months in a cellar and sells for 1,800 rubles ($28) a kilogram.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t last a day without cheese,&#8221; Elvira said, placing curd grains in moulds with the help of an assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are all my babies. I love them.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kovtuns now make 20 soft and hard varieties including camembert and truffle brie, employing a handful of staff.</p>
<p>They produce cheeses five days a week but demand far outstrips supply.</p>
<p>Yevgeny Barabanshchikov, a chef and connoisseur of European cheeses who traditionally shunned Russian-made dairy products, went to meet the Kovtuns as soon as he learned of their success in Bergamo.</p>
<p>&#8220;My interest is professional,&#8221; said Barabanshchikov, executive chef at Integrita, a top supplier of high-quality imported food.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very pleased for them because I know the cheese-making technology,&#8221; Barabanshchikov told AFP, stressing that hard cheeses require a lot of investment, expertise and good-quality milk.</p>
<p>One of the people who has most championed the Kovtuns is their competitor Oleg Sirota, arguably Russia&#8217;s best-known cheesemaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more good creameries we have, the more people will trust us,&#8221; said the 31-year-old head of the Union of Russian Cheesemakers.</p>
<p>He himself took his first gold at a regional competition in France in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sirota recalled how Vyacheslav, who owned a construction firm at the time, ambushed him at a gas station outside Moscow in 2016, saying he wanted to learn the business of cheese-making and was ready to sell his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was stunned,&#8221; Sirota said.</p>
<p>They now help each other, plan to expand their operations and praise Putin for creating what Sirota calls Russia&#8217;s &#8220;cheese fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vyacheslav said Russia&#8217;s modern cheesemakers are continuing a long tradition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not inventing anything new,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We made a lot of cheese a hundred years ago and exported it to Europe and the Baltics. We are now reviving our forefathers&#8217; recipes.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Promotional material for <em>Joker</em> Photo: IC</p>
<p>Reeling from the #MeToo movement, Hollywood has put toxic masculinity under the spotlight this year with a batch of Oscars contenders zeroing in on the father-son dynamic.</p>
<p>From Joaquin Phoenix in<br />
<em>Joker</em> to Brad Pitt&#8217;s Ad Astra, A-listers have flocked to roles which highlight the damage caused by sons&#8217; quests for their fathers&#8217; approval.</p>
<p>But none have confronted the theme more brutally and personally than Waves, the indie coming-of-age drama being tipped as an Oscars dark horse.</p>
<p>The film, portraying a black middle-class family in Miami which implodes following a tragedy, has been hailed as &#8220;a knockout&#8221; by the New York Times and an &#8220;intimate epic&#8221; by The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<p>Director Trey Edward Shults modeled the film&#8217;s strict patriarch on his own stepfather, whose overzealous coaching results in a hideous high-school wrestling injury &#8211; a trauma which is dramatized in the movie, and leads to devastating consequences.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a cautionary tale of the traditional idea of masculinity,&#8221; Shults, 31, told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to build these tough exteriors &#8211; we can be vulnerable, we can communicate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Described as a Dazed and Confused for the Instagram generation, the film shows how the expectation that teenage boys be strong, silent and stoic endures in US culture.</p>
<p>It was released this month by A24, the indie production house behind Oscar-winner Moonlight, with which Waves shares its setting and several themes.</p>
<p>Shults said he forged the central character after swapping stories with star Kelvin Harrison, whose musician father tried and failed to push him to follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would do these sort of intense therapy sessions&#8230; him talking about his father&#8217;s state of mind, his father&#8217;s father, where that stuff came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>The consequences of that pressure led, midway through the film, to what Shults calls &#8220;the ultimate tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, another character&#8217;s reluctant visit to reconcile with his dying biological father in the hospital is ripped directly from the director&#8217;s own life.</p>
<p>Filming the scene was &#8220;terrifying,&#8221; said Shults, adding that the plotline of a teenage boy dragged to the hospital bed by his girlfriend after years of not communicating was &#8220;as identical as can be&#8221; to his own life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like an all-consuming dread that hits you at, like, the pit of your stomach, reliving the most traumatic thing&#8230; It was cathartic. But it was hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The movie has stirred controversy in some parts because its director is white. Many of its poignant scenes about the black experience were shaped by Harrison and his on-screen father Sterling K. Brown (This Is Us).</p>
<p>But Shults said he did not set out to write about a black family until Harrison came on board, and racial politics were always secondary to universal themes of family grief.</p>
<p>In fact, race serves mainly to amplify the father&#8217;s intense drive to succeed. Being black means &#8220;we are not afforded the luxury of being average,&#8221; the father tells his son during one argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all Kel [Harrison]. That&#8217;s all with his dad. They had that very talk,&#8221; said Shults, who admits that trying to portray an African-American family&#8217;s experience was intimidating.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt like a lot of responsibility.&#8221;</p>
