<p>Japanese chicken yakitori kebabs, one of the country&#8217;s most-loved fast foods, will soon be making an appearance in orbit after Japan&#8217;s space agency cleared them for astronaut meals.</p>
<p>The charbroiled chicken meat on skewers and flavored with a variety of sauces is hugely popular in Japan and abroad, and a canned version has just won certification as a &#8220;Japanese space food&#8221; for consumption on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Yakitori joins 34 other Japanese items such as onigiri rice balls, ramen noodles, seaweed soup and cooked mackerel, as Japanese astronauts pine for a taste of home while in orbit.</p>
<p>They can pick what certified Japanese food to bring on their ISS missions, adding to base meals selected by NASA, a spokesman from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) explained on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The approved yakitori will come in two flavors &#8211; soy sauce and yuzu kosho &#8211; green pepper infused with the Japanese citrus fruit yuzu.</p>
<p>But while astronauts may want the full yakitori experience of chewing from a bamboo skewer, strict space rules will make this impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eating from skewers in space would be good&#8230; but the policy is to leave as little waste as possible,&#8221; the JAXA spokesman told AFP.</p>
<p>So the yakitori will be eaten from ring-pull cans with special velcro to keep it from floating away in the microgravity environment.</p>
<p>The approved yakitori cans are manufactured by Hotei Foods, based in Shizuoka, southwest of Tokyo. The company said they expect their cans will blast off when Japanese astronauts leave for the ISS next year.</p>
<p>They won JAXA approval after clearing a rigorous set of criteria such as guaranteeing the food would not degrade even after 18 months at room temperature.</p>

<p>As temperatures dip into the sub-zeros and the cold winds grow stronger, Beijing begins to enter winter. For a lot of locals during this time of the year, there is nothing better than sitting down for some Sic<br />
<em>hu</em>an hot pot with friends or family to let the blazingly hot spices warm up their bodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For people from Guangdong Province in South China, however, this comforting dream would actually be a nightmare as many of them do not like eating spicy food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not some chili peppers should be added to a dish has been a question that Cao Yu and his family constantly wrestled with while he was growing up because his father is from Guangdong, while his mother is from Central China&#8217;s Hunan Province, which is also known for its spicy food. Most of the time, his father relented out of love for his family and everyone ended up eating spicy food. This push and pull among family members, ignited Cao&#8217;s interest in this spicy ingredient, leading him to research how chili peppers were introduced to China and its development in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cao, a researcher from the Center for Migration &amp; Ethnic Studies at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong Province, began by looking into literature references, followed by extensive field research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After years of work, he was finally able to present his findings in his book<br />
<em>The History of Eating Spicy Food in China</em> in June.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book introduces several interesting tidbits of trivia about chili peppers. For instance, it was Afonso de Albuquerque, a Portuguese general, who introduced chili peppers to Asia in the 15th century. After he arrived in India, he started growing some plants he brought from North America, such as tomatoes, cashews, pineapples and chili peppers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book also touched upon the first time that chili peppers were mentioned in Chinese text. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Gao Lian, a writer from Hangzhou in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, wrote in his collection of various prescriptions for a healthy and long life known as<br />
<em>Zunsheng Bajian</em>, &#8220;The white flowers of<br />
<em><em>fan</em><em>jiao</em></em> (Lit: foreign peppers) grow thick. The fruits look like broken ink brushes. They taste spicy, and their red color is rather pleasant.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, rather than being grown for food, chili pepper plants were mainly ornamental.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the word<br />
<em><em>fan</em><em>jiao</em></em> as a clue, Cao looked to the name of dishes to examine the development of chili peppers in China. In Chinese, the words<br />
<em>hu</em>,<br />
<em>fan</em>,<br />
<em>yang</em> were used for ingredients with exotic origins such as<br />
<em>hu</em><br />
<em>jiao</em> (pepper),<br />
<em>hu</em><br />
<em>luobo</em> (carrot),<br />
<em>fan</em><br />
<em>qie</em> (tomato),<br />
<em>fanshu</em> (sweet potato),<br />
<em>yang</em><br />
<em>cong</em> (onion) and<br />
<em>yang</em><br />
<em>baicai</em> (cabbage). Not always, but under most circumstances,<br />
<em>hu</em> indicates that the food was introduced to China between the Qin Dynasty (221BC-206 BC) and Song Dynasty (960-1279), while<br />
<em>fan</em> is associated with the period between the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). After Qing, foreign food introduced to China mostly used<br />
<em>yang</em>. Another item of interest,<br />
<em>hu</em> indicates that the food was introduced to China over land, while<br />
<em>fan</em> and<br />
<em>yang</em> are linked with food that arrived by a marine route to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cao noted that chili peppers, were primarily introduced to China through coastal regions such as the southern provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang and Taiwan, as well as Liaoning Province in Northeast China.</p>
<p>Before chili peppers became part of Chinese people&#8217;s diet, people first discovered its value as a medicine used to alleviate pain. Then later it entered kitchens as an ingredient for dishes. According to the early 18th century Gazetteer of Sizhou Prefecture, &#8221;<br />
<em>hai</em><br />
<em>jiao</em> [lit. sea pepper] is commonly known as<br />
<em>lahu</em>o [lit. spicy fire], the Tu and Miao [two ethnic groups in China] people use it instead of salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A session on The Paper, a Chinese news website, readers and netizens who haven&#8217;t read the book launched a series of intriguing discussions about consuming spicy food in China with Cao.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The habit and capacity of eating spicy food varies from individual to individual. Interestingly, even in Hunan Province, many people don&#8217;t eat spicy food,&#8221; Cao wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Russian cheeses on sale at a shop Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Elvira Kovtun made her first cheese in a pot in her kitchen four years ago.</p>
<p>Kovtun, a housewife and mostly self-taught cheesemaker, became so good that she and her husband decided to turn her passion into a business.</p>
<p>Last month, the high-school sweethearts and parents of three became the first Russians to win a gold prize at the World Cheese Awards, with their &#8220;Peshernyi&#8221; hard cheese taking the honor at the industry&#8217;s equivalent of the Oscars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think this was possible,&#8221; Elvira&#8217;s husband, Vyacheslav Kovtun, told AFP at their small creamery in the industrial town of Korolyov, outside Moscow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I believe in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family&#8217;s success shows how far Russia&#8217;s cheese-making industry has come since President Vladimir Putin banned Western food imports in 2014 in a tit-for-tat measure over the<br />
<a href="http://backup.globaltimes.cn/SPECIALCOVERAGE/Ukrainecrisis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukraine crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Many Russians had developed a taste for French and Italian cheeses prior to sanctions, and Moscow seized the opportunity to put in place an &#8220;import substitution&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>This supported local entrepreneurs trying to set up businesses to replace imported goods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results were often mixed, however, with many customers complaining of the higher price and often inferior quality of the Russian-made products.</p>
<p>But dairy farming and cheese-making have become a bright spot.</p>
<p>According to Russia&#8217;s National Association of Milk Producers, production of cheese and cheese products grew by a third to 670,000 tons a year between 2013 and 2018.</p>
<p>Last week Putin confessed he was &#8220;somewhat worried&#8221; when the first punitive measures were introduced, but the events of the past few years proved that the sanctions had worked to &#8220;our economy&#8217;s advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Ground-breaking&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of artisanal creameries have cropped up across the country and some, like the Kovtuns, are winning top marks from international critics.</p>
<p>Elvira and Vyacheslav, who are both 40 and opened their Korolyov creamery in 2018, had not expected success to come so quickly.</p>
<p>When Elvira called her husband to break the news of the award last month, she was sobbing, Vyacheslav said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got scared. I thought something terrible had happened,&#8221; he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Their creamery&#8217;s website crashed from interest after the awards were announced and the winning cheese sold out until April 2020.</p>
<p>More than 3,800 cheeses from 42 countries were in competition at this year&#8217;s World Cheese Awards in Bergamo, Italy, where products are awarded with supergold, gold, silver or bronze prizes.</p>
<p>At last year&#8217;s competition no Russian entries were recognized but this year the Kovtuns&#8217; Cheese &amp; Beer creamery and three other Russian cheesemakers won a total of nine awards.</p>
<p>John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food which organizes the competition, said the Kovtuns had put Russia on the international cheese map.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our gold winners are some of the best in the world and only a small percentage of entries do this well,&#8221; Farrand said, praising their Peshernyi cheese for &#8220;delivering a true sense of terroir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Russia&#8217;s lack of the cheese-making heritage of France or Italy could in some ways be an advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Free from the pressures of tradition, the country&#8217;s artisans can innovate and produce something ground-breaking and unique,&#8221; Farrand said in written comments to AFP.</p>
<p>Elvira said she spent several years perfecting Peshernyi and the recipe is a closely guarded secret.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Cheese fever&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>With its nutty and fruity hints, Peshernyi matures for seven months in a cellar and sells for 1,800 rubles ($28) a kilogram.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t last a day without cheese,&#8221; Elvira said, placing curd grains in moulds with the help of an assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are all my babies. I love them.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kovtuns now make 20 soft and hard varieties including camembert and truffle brie, employing a handful of staff.</p>
<p>They produce cheeses five days a week but demand far outstrips supply.</p>
<p>Yevgeny Barabanshchikov, a chef and connoisseur of European cheeses who traditionally shunned Russian-made dairy products, went to meet the Kovtuns as soon as he learned of their success in Bergamo.</p>
<p>&#8220;My interest is professional,&#8221; said Barabanshchikov, executive chef at Integrita, a top supplier of high-quality imported food.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very pleased for them because I know the cheese-making technology,&#8221; Barabanshchikov told AFP, stressing that hard cheeses require a lot of investment, expertise and good-quality milk.</p>
<p>One of the people who has most championed the Kovtuns is their competitor Oleg Sirota, arguably Russia&#8217;s best-known cheesemaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more good creameries we have, the more people will trust us,&#8221; said the 31-year-old head of the Union of Russian Cheesemakers.</p>
<p>He himself took his first gold at a regional competition in France in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sirota recalled how Vyacheslav, who owned a construction firm at the time, ambushed him at a gas station outside Moscow in 2016, saying he wanted to learn the business of cheese-making and was ready to sell his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was stunned,&#8221; Sirota said.</p>
<p>They now help each other, plan to expand their operations and praise Putin for creating what Sirota calls Russia&#8217;s &#8220;cheese fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vyacheslav said Russia&#8217;s modern cheesemakers are continuing a long tradition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not inventing anything new,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We made a lot of cheese a hundred years ago and exported it to Europe and the Baltics. We are now reviving our forefathers&#8217; recipes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Healthy food sold in Israel will be marked with green stickers starting from January 2020, Israeli Ministry of Health announced on Sunday.</p>
<p>The marking will be carried out by food manufacturers, importers, and marketers, and food that cannot be labeled will be marked by a green sign posted next to it.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the purpose of green labeling is to assist consumers in choosing food that fits the principles of healthy nutrition as recommended in Israel.</p>
<p>The conditions for inclusion in healthy food groups are based on minimal processing and avoidance of harmful substances such as excess saturated fat, sugar, and salt, per the decisions of a scientific committee appointed by the ministry.</p>
<p>Accordingly, products that may be marked are milk, white cheese, and yogurt with up to 5 percent fat, including tofu, olive oil, whole wheat pasta, raw fish, and fresh eggs among others.</p>
<p>The green mark, which will be voluntary in the first phase, joins a previous decision by the ministry, requiring the red marking of unhealthy products starting January as well.</p>
<p>These are foods with a high amount of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium.</p>
<p>Besides, Israeli food manufacturers will be required to change the nutrition facts lists on the packaging so that components such as sodium and fat appear ahead of protein, and that the sugar amount will include &#8220;translation&#8221; for the number of spoons.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A cup of sake Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The sommelier lingers over her glass, taking in the bouquet while clutching a spoon of caviar and cucumber jelly. The union of food and beverage is &#8220;magical&#8221;, she declares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Paz Levinson, head sommelier at the high-end Anne-Sophie Pic restaurant group, is not savoring a sought-after vintage from Bordeaux or Bourgogne. She is holding a glass of sake, the humble Japanese rice drink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sake works very well with French cuisine,&#8221; says the Argentine.</p>
<p>France is only the 11th largest market in the world for sake, where the total sales remain below two million euros ($2.2 million) per year. But its consumption is soaring, with imports increased by some 160 percent between 2012 and 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anne-Sophie Pic, the head chef and owner of the eponymous restaurant group has won eight Michelin stars in her career, and she is a sake convert. She first used the drink in her recipes before adding it to the wine list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other hotels and restaurants are equally keen.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>&#8216;Sake boom&#8217;</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p></strong>In a growing market, entrepreneurs have sniffed an opportunity &#8212; French sake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two companies already produce the drink domestically &#8212; both in wine-growing regions. Takuma Inagawa, a French-educated Japanese brewer, has a different idea. He wants to start production in an old warehouse in Fresnes, a town just south of Paris.</p>
<p>Despite his Japanese heritage and the industrial surroundings of Fresnes, he is keen to imbue the drink with the best French traditions. &#8220;We wanted local, French rice,&#8221; says Inagawa, whose warehouse holds hundreds of bags marked &#8220;Camargue rice&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The French are ready to accept sake but, with the trend towards a sustainable environment, there is a potential for French sake,&#8221; says the 31-year-old, whose company Wakaze was set up in Japan making flavored versions of the alcohol.</p>
<p>He hopes eventually to use Burgundy oak barrels to age some of his product &#8212; believing this will please French and Japanese drinkers, as he has already produced a run of 17,000 bottles in his homeland.</p>
<p>Sake began to get popular in France about 15 or 20 years ago, according to expert Sylvain Huet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He says a &#8220;sushi boom&#8221; led to a &#8220;sake boom&#8221; in the restaurants and dining rooms on Rue Sainte-Anne, a Parisian street near the Louvre known as Little Tokyo because of the proliferation of Japanese businesses.</p>
<p>But the impact was initially limited to that small area of Paris.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Sake &#8216;evangelist&#8217;</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huet though believes France has got a taste for the drink: &#8220;Over the next 10 years, the market in France will increase fivefold, even tenfold,&#8221; he predicts.</p>
<p>Huet set up his own Sake Fair in 2014 and says he catered to over 5,100 visitors in this year&#8217;s edition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, sommelier Xavier Thuizat has also been enchanted by the drink, establishing his own tasting competition &#8212; &#8220;Kura Master&#8221; &#8212; in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He says he hit an impasse six years ago, unable to find the right drink to go with certain foods.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find the solution,&#8221; he explains, adding that despite coming from the wine-producing region of Burgundy, France&#8217;s famous drop just did not cut it.</p>
<p>Then a Japanese man told him to try sake, which set him on a path to becoming an &#8220;evangelist&#8221; for the Japanese drink.</p>
<p>While these French enthusiasts treat sake as a high-end product for gastronomes &#8212; that is not the case for everyone.</p>
<p>The word sake in Japanese is generic, referring to many types of alcohol. And sake has also been adopted by Chinese brewers as a useful label for their cheap sorghum brandy.</p>
<p>But the French converts are sanguine. &#8220;I now bring sake as a gift when I go back to Burgundy,&#8221; says sommelier Thuizat. &#8220;The reactions are good.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px"><em>Gancao</em> fruit Photo: Bi Mengying/GT</p>
<p>Early Chinese immigrants from Canton (South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province) spread their history, culture and also food for the world to explore. Various recipes of dim sums, chow mein, lo mein, and char siu, are some examples of the popular Cantonese food.</p>
<p>However, things are a little different in the eastern region of the province -Teochew (Chaoshan), which includes the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou, and Jieyang. Unlike the rest of Guangdong, people in Teochew don&#8217;t speak Cantonese, and the Teochew cuisines display a style of their own. I was able to catch a glimpse of the typical &#8220;Cantonese food&#8221; during my short trip to Chaoshan.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Yu Sheng</span></strong></p>
<p>Yu means fish in Chinese, while<br />
<em>sheng</em> means something raw. Besides<br />
<em>yu sheng</em>, there are also similar varieties of shrimp, lobster, geoduck and cuttlefish. I ordered both<br />
<em>yu sheng</em> and<br />
<em> xia</em> (shrimp)<br />
<em>sheng</em> and was served with thinly sliced raw fish and shrimp strips evenly laid on the plates that seemed to be woven by bamboos. Unlike sashimi in Japan, pairing with the fish and shrimp strips, there was also a dipping sauce and a plate of assorted colorful ingredients including shredded radish, ginger, Tabasco pepper, celery, sliced garlic, onion, star-fruits, limes, and some peanuts.</p>
<p>Judging by the lost look evident on my face, the waiter stopped by and walked me through the intricacies of enjoying<br />
<em>yu sheng</em> and<br />
<em>xia sheng</em>. After putting a bit of every ingredient&nbsp; in the bowl, he picked a fish strip, which was so thinly sliced that it appeared almost transparent under the light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sauce here is the key. It&#8217;s our restaurant&#8217;s secret recipe. You slightly dip the fish here and then enjoy it with the small serving of all the ingredients in the bowl. Eat them together. Do the same with<br />
<em>xia sheng</em>, but local people usually finish<br />
<em>yu sheng</em> first before they eat<br />
<em>xia sheng</em>,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The vibrant colors in the bowl already made the dish very Instagram-friendly and the taste of it was something beyond my expectations. A blend of spicy, zesty, sour, it was like all the flavors perfectly complemented without being insipid. Besides the fresh fish strips, there were also some strips of fish skin, the texture of which was very chewy yet a bit crispy at the same time. Therefore, it was a totally new experience of relishing the skins, the same way as the fish strips that is explicable only when tried in person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">All That Beef</span></strong></p>
<p>Chaoshan beef meatballs are quite popular across China. People from different regions eat them with hot pot,<br />
<em>malatang</em> (a type of street food derived from Southwest China&#8217;s hot pot), or add them to various kinds of noodles and soups.</p>
<p>As for in Chaoshan, beef meatballs, most of which are handmade, can be found in<br />
<em>guotiao</em> (a type of rice noodle in Chaoshan) soup for breakfast. The soup also contains vegetables, making it a well-balanced meal. When it comes to dinner, Chaoshan beef hot pot would be a great choice. Along with the handmade beef meatballs, there is a wide selection of beef available. The soup of Chaoshan beef hot pot is not spicy like the Sichuan hot pot. Instead, it aims to preserve the pristine flavors of the beef, and the locals also fancy savoring the hot pot with a pot of Chaoshan<br />
<em>sanbao</em> tea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Dessert and Snacks</span></strong></p>
<p>Chaoshan<br />
<em>sanbao</em> (literal Chinese translation is three treasures) refers to<br />
<em>laoxianghuang</em>,<br />
<em>laoyaoju</em> and<br />
<em>huangpichi</em>, which are marinated chayote, kumquat, and wampi fruit. The three ingredients each have different health benefits, such as alleviating nausea or cough and warming up bodies. The marinating process is quite complicated and time-consuming. Similar to preserved wine and liquor, it is generally considered, the longer, the better. To be noted, the complex skills for making<br />
<em>laoxianghuang</em>, has been inscribed on the list of the intangible cultural heritage of Guangdong Province in 2009. When<br />
<em> sanbao</em> tea blends with the three together, not only it&#8217;s full of flavor with citrus-and-plum-like notes, but it also highly benefits your body, especially given the humid and steamy climate of Chaoshan.</p>
<p>Another equally popular choice for dessert is<br />
<em>gancao</em> fruit. The street food is ubiquitous in the Chaoshan area. Nothing looks more luscious than the miscellaneous fruits in different colors arranged neatly. Some of the fruits are total strangers to a northerner like me. The vendor will ask you to pick the fruits you like and toss them with their homemade sauce, which is made from<br />
<em>gancao</em>, also known as the Chinese liquorice, often used as a type of sweetener in Traditional Chinese medicine. And the taste of the sauce seemed to be varying from vendor to vendor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our shop has been around for nearly a century. We just moved here from the old movie theater. My father-in-law passed down the recipe to me,&#8221; said the female owner of a shop named Shunji Gancao in Chaozhou happily. Her husband also proudly took out a jar of the sauce and showed it to me, &#8220;You cannot find it anywhere else. It would be different. My father is almost 100-year-old. The recipe, the taste, the store, they are full of history&#8221;.<br />

<p>Two restaurants in Bangkok have each earned a pair of coveted Michelin stars, the first time the leading guide has awarded the accolade to local establishments offering Thai cuisine.</p>
<p>Located in Bangkok, the restaurants Sorn and R-Haan were upgraded from their previous one-star rating in the third edition of the Michelin guide in Thailand, unveiled Tuesday in the capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorn celebrates traditional techniques and recipes from southern Thailand, where it sources from a network of small producers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the helm of R-Haan, Chef Chumpol offers food inspired by products from all regions of the kingdom.</p>
<p>No establishment won three stars in this 2020 edition, but three others retain two &#8211; the French restaurants Le Normandie and Mezzaluna, as well as that of German twin brothers Suhring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year some 29 establishments in Thailand received stars.</p>
<p>Gwendal Poullennec, international director of Michelin Guides, said the ratings showcased &#8220;Thailand&#8217;s rich diversity and high quality of local produce.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thailand is already famed for its street food and Bangkok&#8217;s curbside crab omelette standout Jay Fai retained its one star.</p>
<p>Despite criticism over its alleged Eurocentrism and focus on pricey restaurants, the red guide, created in 1900, remains a key reference in the world of the gastronomy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of some 20,000 restaurants listed worldwide, only about 100 have achieved the highest distinction of the &#8220;three stars.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michelin covers Asia in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Macao, Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore and Bangkok.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">A farmer is holding his basket of cucumbers. Photo: IC</p>
<p>An all-out shift to organic farming in England and Wales could lead to a net increase in Britain&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions as a drop in yields would lead to higher food imports, scientists estimated Tuesday.</p>
<p>While going organic creates lower emissions per foodstuff it also makes farming less efficient, as fertilizer use encourages food to grow quicker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A team of researchers from Cranfield University found that direct emissions from farming in England and Wales would go down if the agriculture sector ditched nitrogen-based fertilizers and went fully organic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But yields would drop by up to 40 percent, meaning more land would need covering to pasture and cropland to make up for the losses &#8212; thereby contributing to a net increase in planet-warming greenhouse gases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Although there are undoubted local environmental benefits to organic farming practices, including soil carbon storage, reduced exposure to pesticides and improved biodiversity, we need to set these against the requirement for greater production elsewhere,&#8221; said Guy Kirk, professor of soil systems at Cranfield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The farming sector contributes upwards of a quarter of all manmade emissions globally, and a string of high profile reports in recent years have warned that unsustainable mass-scale agriculture imperils the Paris climate goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While nitrogen-based fertilizers release powerful greenhouse gases, livestock release methane on a mass scale, leading some to call for diets lower in meat in developed nations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s study, published in the journal Nature Communications, found that purely organic farming would increase beef cattle and sheep numbers due to increased pastureland, while pigs, poultry and eggs would decrease, largely because of a lack of concentrated feed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authors said that a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions if Britain went fully organic would only be achievable in conjunction with &#8220;widespread changes to national diets&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>

</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">A bowl of instant noodles served Photo: IC</p>
<p>In a busy factory in the city of Shaoguan, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, very few workers are doing a routine checkup of the facilities, which can produce nearly 20 million packs of instant noodles every month.</p>
<p>The 30,000 square meters factory is owned by Sinar Mas Group, one of the largest conglomerates in Indonesia. Equipped with advanced production lines, mixing flour, baking and toasting, cutting and packaging can be completed by the machine with several times higher production efficiency rate than that of manual work.</p>
<p>The new plant, the stage I of a Shaoguan-based project of Sinar Mas, started operation in April. Those instant noodles are mainly sold in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stage II will soon start building, which will produce more healthy food for Chinese customers,&#8221; said the factory&#8217;s manager Cheng Yinping.</p>
<p>With a total investment of 170 million yuan ($ 24 million dollars), the factory is expected to produce an annual output of over 900 million packs of instant noodles after its completion, according to Cheng.</p>
<p>High hopes are pinned on the Shaoguan plant, as the Sinar Mas China Food Division considers it an important step in its transformation and upgrading in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to build this factory into our headquarter in south China, as well as the most important flagship factory in China,&#8221; said Patrick Huang, corporate affairs vice president of Sinar Mas China Food Division, adding that the Shaoguan plant will be equipped with the best facilities and given heavy investment.</p>
<p>Established in 1938, Sinar Mas was founded by a Chinese-Indonesian tycoon and entered the Chinese market after acquiring a food company in Guangdong in 1994. Its business now ranges from food production to financial services, with 380,000 employees worldwide.</p>
<p>Aside from Guangdong, the company&#8217;s footprint in China has expanded, with plants located in the provinces of Liaoning, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Jiangsu.</p>
<p>China has always been playing a crucial role in fuelling Sinar Mas&#8217;s business, Huang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, we&#8217;ve benefited from China&#8217;s opening-up and its demographic dividend. Our business of fast-moving consumer goods has seen rapid development,&#8221; Huang added. &#8220;Since China&#8217;s economy continues to thrive, we started to build plants in China and broaden the market. In the new era, we expect more opportunities in this country as China is opening wider to the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noticing the booming e-payment and e-commerce, the company has established cooperation with China&#8217;s leading e-commerce giants like Alibaba and JD.com, to seek new retail channels and make a smarter marketing plan.</p>
<p>The company will also join the forthcoming online shopping spree which falls on Nov 11 to boost consumption, according to Cheng.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the relationship between Indonesia and China gets closer, I believe the economic relations between the two countries will reach a higher level and companies from both sides will achieve win-win outcomes,&#8221; Huang said.</p>
<p>Huang also looks forward to introducing more Indonesian products to China through the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI) and selling its products produced in China to more countries and regions along the BRI.</p>

<p>Dishes such as spring rolls and sweet and sour chicken may be familiar to many lovers of Chinese food in English-speaking countries, but what about dishes such as<br />
<em>chun bing</em> or knife noodles?</p>
<p>Translating the names of dishes has always been somewhat of a challenging task for restaurant owners outside of China.</p>
<p>Take Junzi Kitchen, a Chinese fast-casual restaurant chain in the US was established by a group of Yale-educated entrepreneurs from China, for instance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Chinese philosophy, a<br />
<em>junzi </em>is a person with integrity. Being a<br />
<em>junzi</em> is a pursuit: It means to be honest, kind, open to new ideas, and above all, the best version of ourselves,&#8221; writes the restaurant chain&#8217;s official website.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Junzi</em> is often translated to &#8220;gentleman&#8221; in English, yet the English word is not fully capable of portraying the complete meaning of the original Chinese and all its connotations. Similarly, finding the right translation for certain Chinese dishes can also prove difficult. So much so that Junzi Kitchen has decided that it is much easier to use the Chinese pinyin for some dishes or a literal translation in some cases for its menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to &#8220;Squash and grain salad&#8221; and &#8220;smashed cucumbers,&#8221; the name says it all, but for<br />
<em>chun bing</em> and knife noodles, the restaurant has added a small explanation so hungry customers know what they are getting if they decide to give these dishes a try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8221;<br />
<em>Chun bing</em> is a northern Chinese thin flour-pressed dough,&#8221; while the entry for knife noodles says they &#8220;are wide, wavy, rippled noodles with a variety of textures and thickness.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Entering the lexicon</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, Junzi Kitchen is not the first to attempt to introduce Chinese food to English-speakers. Buwei Yang Chao did so in her book<br />
<em>How to Cook and Eat in Chinese</em>, first published in 1945. US culinary historian Anne Mendelson described the work as &#8220;the first truly insightful English-language Chinese cookbook.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book has a foreword by the well-known writer Hu Shi, also a former ambassador to the US, and a preface by Pearl Buck, a US author famous for her expertise on the subject of China. In the foreword, Hu spoke highly of the creativity in the language the book uses to describe certain Chinese cooking methods, such as defisher, stir-fry, meeting and plunging. It is through this book that the word stir-fry entered the English lexicon and became a common word in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In her book, the author noted that the original Chinese word<br />
<em> chao</em> &#8220;cannot be accurately translated into English. Roughly speaking, ch&#8217;ao may be defined as a big-fire-shallow-fat-continual-stirring-quick-frying of cut-up material with wet seasoning. So we shall call it stir-fry.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary included the noun form of &#8220;stir-fry&#8221; in its new word list in June 2015. Subsequently, the adjective and verb forms were also added to the dictionary. In addition to stir-fry, other words originated from the book such as soy jam, red-cooking, pot sticker, dim sum and yuan hsiao.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Cultural confidence</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more Chinese dishes from various regions throughout China enter the US, the challenge of translating and introducing them has increased. Take Xi&#8217;an Famous Food for instance, a restaurant chain that has expanded multiple branches across New York City from its original location in Flushing in 2005. The widely-popular store brands itself as &#8220;the first restaurant to bring the little-known cuisine of Xi&#8217;an to the United States.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The family-owned business hopes to introduce the world to the unique cuisine of their hometown of Xi&#8217;an in Northwest China such as<br />
<em>liangpi</em>,<br />
<em>roujiamo</em> and<br />
<em>biangbiang mian</em> &#8211; all in their most authentic forms.</p>
<p>For<br />
<em>liangpi</em>, they used a literal translation from the Chinese coming up &#8220;cold-skin noodles.&#8221; &#8220;Chewy wheat flour noodles, tossed with bean sprouts, cucumbers, cilantro and cubes of spongy gluten,&#8221; the chain&#8217;s website further notes in its description of the dish. For<br />
<em>roujiamo</em>, this is called a &#8220;burger&#8221; and described as a warm and crispy flatbread-like bun packed with different stuffing. As for<br />
<em>biangbiang mian</em>, it is listed as wide, hand-ripped noodles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Malangtang</em> is another point in case. Rather than a fancy dish, this is a type of street food that derived from Southwest China&#8217;s hot pot, but adapted to cater to the taste buds of northerners. Meanwhile, there is also<br />
<em> maocai</em>, which is rather similar to<br />
<em>malatang</em> but keeps its southwestern spicy flavor. The difference between the two still baffles many who live in China, so some people might wonder how it should be translated into English when it enters the US market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laoma Spicy, a<br />
<em>malatang</em> restaurant franchise headquartered in Flushing, New York has decided to forgo translating the name and just call the spicy soup dish<br />
<em>malatang</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8221;<br />
<em>Mala</em> (spicy in Chinese) is flavor, many restaurants are using the word in their names now. Some Chinese companies maybe lack cultural confidence, so they end up doing a bad job of translating the many great names [of our food],&#8221; Liu Tuo, owner of Laoma Spicy, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Laoma Spicy also serves another spicy Chinese dish<br />
<em>mala xiangguo</em>, which usually contains meat and vegetables and is often translated as &#8220;dry hot pot&#8221; at some restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We translated it as<br />
<em> mala</em> wok, because<br />
<em>xiangguo</em> [fragrant pot] is hard to pronounce [for non-Chinese speakers]. And wok is the term for a Chinese black iron pot. I think it&#8217;s more appropriate to translate it this way.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked whether the names<br />
<em>malatang</em> or<br />
<em>mala</em> wok might turn away those who cannot figure out what type of dish it is from the names, Liu responded, &#8220;There&#8217;s no need to worry about that. Before we tried taco or pizza for the first time, we probably didn&#8217;t know much about them, either.&#8221;&nbsp;<br />
