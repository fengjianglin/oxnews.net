<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chinese Premier Li Keqiang spoke on the phone with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, and discussed China-European Union (EU) relations and cooperation on such issues as multilateralism, free trade and climate change.</p>
<p>Li congratulated von der Leyen on assuming her new position and spoke highly of the current development of<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1049794.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China-EU relations</a>.</p>
<p>He said that China and the EU are each other&#8217;s major cooperative partners, and both are committed to upholding multilateralism and free trade.</p>
<p>China has always firmly supported the process of European integration, the Chinese premier said, noting that the two sides focus on their broad common interests, and strengthen strategic communication and all-round cooperation, which is beneficial to both China and the EU, and the world at large.</p>
<p>As the world&#8217;s largest developing country, China still has a long way to go to realize modernization, Li said.</p>
<p>He added that China will actively fulfill the commitments made in the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/958199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Agreement</a>, make arduous efforts to address climate change, continuously improve the environment in the process of industrialization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, and work with the international community, including the EU, to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>Li also welcomed new EU leaders to visit China for the 22nd China-EU Summit next year.</p>
<p>For her part, von der Leyen said the fact that she held phone talks with Premier Li on the day of her inauguration indicates that the EU highly values its relations with China.</p>
<p>The year 2020 will be a landmark for the development of EU-China relations as it will see a series of significant high-level exchanges between the two sides, von der Leyen said, noting that she looks forward to coming to China next year for the 22nd EU-China Summit.</p>
<p>She said that the EU and China share broad common interests on such issues as sustainable development and China-EU investment agreement negotiation.</p>
<p>Dealing with climate change is a priority of the new EU commission, she said, adding that the commission highly appreciates China&#8217;s efforts on the issue and is willing to work with China to consolidate cooperation in addressing climate change and the reform of the World Trade Organization, in order to promote progress in EU-China relations.</p>

<p>China and the EU should play a leading role in countering trade protectionism through fair and mutually beneficial economic opening-up, and they should help reform the global trade system based on the WTO and other multilateral systems, said a joint statement issued by Chinese and EU representatives attending the two-day 3rd EU-China CEO and Former Senior Officials&#8217; Dialogue that closed in Beijing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Representatives from China and the EU stressed the huge potential for China-EU economic and trade cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;To further release the potential, the two sides should establish a bilateral economic and trade relationship based on mutual benefit, equal opening-up and no bias. A fair competition environment with improved transparency should be established,&#8221; said the statement.</p>
<p>They suggested the two sides continuously improve their business climates to improve investment conditions. They encouraged the EU and China to work intensively toward negotiations on e-commerce, investment facilitation, and strengthening international rules on industrial subsidies.</p>
<p>Zeng Peiyan, chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said at the opening ceremony of the conference that trade between China and the EU surged 250 times over the past 40 years to reach $682 billion in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU is China&#8217;s largest trading partner, and China is the second-largest trade partner of the EU. So far in 2019, bilateral trade has surpassed 1.5 billion euros ($1.65 billion) per day, according to the statement.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s opening-up and huge domestic consumption market will provide new opportunities for China-EU cooperation, especially in healthcare, digital economy and developing third-party markets, Zeng said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accelerating the signing of a bilateral investment treaty and making a new cooperation agenda after 2020 will be an important opportunity to boost the two sides&#8217; economic growth,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>During the dialogue, they also called for governments to advance WTO reform, saying existing rules have not kept up with the needs of global value chains and changes in the external environment.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC </p>
<p>When Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met with High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission Federica Mogherini in late October, he expressed hopes both sides could complete China-Europe investment agreement negotiations next year as scheduled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a positive signal to the world against the backdrop of the China-US trade war, enduring trade conflicts between the US and European countries, rising protectionism, unilateralism and anti-globalization. As a result, people have regained confidence in the development of China-Europe relations and the improvement of world trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The China-Europe economic relationship had faltered for some time, especially when the &#8220;EU-China &#8211; A strategic outlook&#8221; released in March, for the first time, formally labeled China an economic &#8220;systemic rival&#8221; and a &#8220;strategic competitor.&#8221; Faced with stark comparisons between China&#8217;s rapid economic development and EU&#8217;s own, the EU has been overburdened by excessive anxiety and has adopted anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures, while establishing an investment review mechanism to achieve market distortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, China is required to &#8220;fully reciprocate&#8221; on bilateral economic and trade activities. It is wrong and illogical for the EU to take such a confrontational approach instead of cooperating to resolve the matter. The latest progress on China-Europe investment agreement negotiations provides the world a revelation on how to handle economic and trade frictions between different economies while maintaining a dynamic balance between developed and emerging economies.</p>
<p>China-EU economic and trade cooperation has a solid foundation and bright prospects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, unlike the US, which has defined China as a strategic competitor, a conflict between China and Europe in terms of strategy, structure and geopolitics does not exist.</p>
<p>Second, China and the EU have identical or similar positions in many aspects of global governance on multilateralism, free trade, climate change and environmental protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, both have a mutual understanding and dependence on the world economy and bilateral relations are characterized by mutual benefit through cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, cooperation between China-EU, China-EU member states, and China-EU sub-regions has developed over the years. More than 50 economic and trade dialogue and consultation mechanisms, including the China-EU High-level Economic and Trade Dialogue, provide a solid infrastructure and institutional guarantee for bilateral exchanges.</p>
<p>Most importantly, China has given a positive and pragmatic response to economic and trade concerns raised by developed economies, including the EU, from the government&#8217;s position to specific actions. In response to concerns about market access, intellectual property protection and compulsory technology transfer, the Chinese government has implemented measures that have shortened the negative list of foreign investment access by adding free trade pilot zones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign investment restrictions in manufacturing, mining, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery industries were largely eliminated. With the promulgation of the new Foreign Investment Law, foreign investors are given national treatment and 100 percent ownership in certain industries where ownership caps previously applied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China continues to prohibit compulsory technology transfer and strengthen intellectual property protection. By eliminating remittance restrictions, China has committed to opening up the capital market further, which has significantly improved the business environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2019 World Bank ranking of the Global Business Environment Index shows China jumped from 78th in 2017 to 31st. The improvement of China-EU economic and trade relations can also be seen as the result of China&#8217;s practical actions.</p>
<p>As globalization faces a headwind amid US trade protectionism and economic bullying, the EU should accept how China is at a different development stage, respect China&#8217;s development rights, and use positive and constructive consultations rather than pressure to deal with bilateral economic and trade issues. Once this is achieved, both sides could embark on a road of cooperation that would benefit their people and the interests of all countries involved.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC </p>
<p>Right after Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis ended his trip to China in early November,&nbsp;Chinese President Xi Jinping embarked on a reciprocal three-day trip to Greece on Sunday. Such high-level exchanges within a short period have drawn widespread attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The newly elected Greek government, formed by center-right New Democracy party, is making efforts to attract more foreign investment and promote economic reforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a time when Europeans were worried Greece could exit the EU due to the debt crisis. Fortunately, Greek economic recovery has stood out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooperation with China has to some extent brought benefit to the country. For example, the Piraeus Port project located in the Athens urban area has received massive investments from the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) and hundreds of local people are working at the port, including administrative staff and employees; only a few Chinese can be spotted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greece&#8217;s economy is still relatively weak now. Economic recovery is the most crucial task for Greece. Boosting ties with China is closely connected with Greek development goals. China&#8217;s investments in the country have continued to increase during these years and both sides are negotiating new projects. This is not only in the interest of Greece and China but is also in line with EU interests &#8211; the bloc would like to see Greece get over its debt crisis and return to the path of healthy development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, political figures in Brussels are concerned about China&#8217;s objective in establishing a cooperation platform with Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The 17+1 initiative (China-CEE countries cooperation initiative) is regarded as China&#8217;s intention to divide and rule the EU. This explains why the EU&#8217;s policy paper &#8220;EU-China &#8211; A strategic outlook,&#8221; released in March, stressed ever more strongly that Europe should speak with one voice when negotiating with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such fear is a reminder to Beijing that when developing cooperation with EU member states, it should make clear in which fields the bloc has exclusive competence and in which areas it shares competence with its member states. This would help promote relations between Beijing and Brussels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the EU and China are highly interdependent on trade and seriously committed to jointly maintaining world peace and sustainable development. The new EU Commission is going to take office before the end of this year. Relations with China will be one of its major priorities. The agreement on the EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation, which was launched in 2013 and calls for cooperation in the areas of &#8220;peace, prosperity, sustainable development and people-to-people exchanges,&#8221; is due next year. At this point, the two sides need to work together to see how to manage differences and disagreements and how to facilitate cooperation for mutual benefit in the long run.</p>
<p>Both the EU and China attach great importance to Eurasian connectivity and are proactively exploring feasible projects on the continent. The Piraeus Port surpassed the port of Valencia, a major port city in eastern Spain, earlier this year, to become the busiest port in the Mediterranean Sea. The success of Piraeus, in which Chinese investment not only brings economic benefits but also increases local employment, may serve as an example of further cooperation between China and Greece as well as between China and Europe.</p>

<p>Truck driver Lusso waits patiently at the Duisburg Intermodal Terminal (DIT) for a freight train from China. He is one of the several hundreds of truck drivers waiting at the largest of the nine terminals of the Port of Duisburg in western Germany to ship a China Railway Express-branded container.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old Macedonian, who gave his name only as Lusso, said the freight train running between China and Duisburg has been a great help to his business.</p>
<p>Business in Duisburg, the world&#8217;s largest inland port, began to pick up after the rail freight services were launched in 2011, and remarkably boosted by the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative%20News%20Desk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> (B&amp;R) initiative&nbsp; from 2013.</p>
<p>Linking China and Europe, the China Railway Express (CRE) plays a vital role in reviving and extending the ancient trade route, the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/ReportsfromtheSilkRoad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silk Road</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A road for ordinary people</strong></p>
<p>Lusso has transported an increasing number of containers from China to cities across Europe in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea about what things are inside those containers, what I know is that I get delivery contracts,&#8221; Lusso said. He has also encouraged his son to earn a living as a truck driver.</p>
<p>In the past, silk or porcelain products were usually found inside the containers, but not any longer. Made-in-China laptops, mobile phones and clothes are now the most popular CRE shipments, while fine European wines and BMW vehicle parts are among the typical goods that travel back to China.</p>
<p>Nowadays, about 25 freight trains travel every week between Chinese cities and Duisburg, namely 15 China-bound trains and 10 Europe-bound ones, accounting for nearly one-third of the freight volume of DIT, which has had to hire more drivers and workers to handle truck containers, as well as to build more warehouses.</p>
<p>Johannes Pflug, Duisburg&#8217;s city official in charge of Chinese affairs, said the rail transport business has created over 6,000 jobs.</p>
<p>CRE freight trains, a key project under the B&amp;R initiative, leave from Alashankou in Northwest China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region and then cross Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus and Poland before reaching Germany after about two weeks.</p>
<p>The trains have also linked many other European cities including Hamburg, Madrid and Warsaw to Chinese cities like Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing, Yiwu in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, and Zhengzhou, capital of Central China&#8217;s Henan Province.</p>
<p>In Poland&#8217;s railway hub of Lodz, Hatrans Logistics is among the many local businesses benefiting from the new trade route. In 2016, the company became the first Polish enterprise to invest in Chengdu, capital of Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province. With the support of the CRE freight services, the enterprise has opened a mall in Chengdu to sell Polish products.</p>
<p>Hatrans has also set up a platform for cooperation between enterprises of the two countries. It now sells over 300 kinds of Polish products across China, while bringing Chinese clothes, cosmetics and electronics to Poland and other European markets.</p>
<p><strong>A road for connectivity</strong> </p>
<p>The B&amp;R initiative, also known as the overland Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, was proposed by China in 2013 in a bid to seek common prosperity. Enhanced connectivity is both its approach and benefit.</p>
<p>Similarly to the ancient Silk Road, Europe is one of its key terminals. In addition to the CRE, China is working on other transport infrastructures there.</p>
<p>In Croatia, a Chinese enterprise is building the Peljesac Bridge, a historic infrastructure project, by connecting the port city of Dubrovnik with the rest of the country.</p>
<p>In Serbia, the E-763 highway is expected to be completed at the end of this year, while in Greece, Chinese company COSCO in 2016 began operating the Port of Piraeus, the southern gateway to Europe. </p>
<p>The Athens-based Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research estimates that the deal will create 25,000 jobs by 2052.</p>
<p>Investments have been flowing into Europe thanks to the new Silk Road as well. </p>
<p>In Serbia, the over 100-year-old Smederevo steel plant was saved from bankruptcy in 2016 when China&#8217;s largest steelmaker HBIS Group purchased it.</p>
<p>Renamed Hesteel Serbia, the plant now employs over 5,000 workers, bringing local unemployment rates down to 6 percent from 18 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our jobs are guaranteed now, the feeling is totally different,&#8221; said 34-year-old electrician Aleksandar Pavkovic. He can now join his children for a seaside holiday with no fear of losing his job, and his father is a veteran in the plant working as a senior workshop quality inspector.</p>
<p>Since its rail connection to Chengdu, Lodz has seen more investors, warehouses, small and medium-sized enterprises, trade deals as well as higher employment, said Monika Karolczak, deputy director of the Polish city&#8217;s trade and international cooperation office.</p>
<p><strong>A road for shared views</strong></p>
<p>The B&amp;R initiative is becoming a household name for many Europeans.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the very beginning, we considered B&amp;R as an initiative for promoting peace,&#8221; Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said earlier this month. He also believes that B&amp;R projects have helped boost Serbia&#8217;s economy and improved Serbian people&#8217;s living standards.</p>
<p>Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said in April that the Chinese-contracted Peljesac Bridge project is of long-term strategic importance, and its bidding was in accordance with Croatia&#8217;s public procurement procedures and EU standards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Slovakia is looking forward to taking part in the B&amp;R initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am convinced that the B&amp;R initiative is the future of Europe as a whole. Slovakia is at the intersection, so it means that for the Slovak economy in the next 25 years, this project can provide a relatively trouble-free existence,&#8221; said Dana Meager, state secretary of the Slovak Finance Ministry and government proxy for the B&amp;R initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;The B&amp;R initiative is a key opportunity for Europe to achieve development,&#8221; said Jochen Scholz, a political analyst who is writing a book titled<br />
<em>The New Silk Road: The Key to a Prosperous European Future</em>.</p>
<p>Scholz&#8217;s book was inspired by Michael Schaefer, German Ambassador to China from 2008 to 2013 and now chairman of the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt.</p>
<p>Schaefer wrote in the Berlin Policy Journal in January 2016 that the new Silk Road may well represent a sincere attempt by China to start a new kind of diplomacy based on inclusiveness, equal opportunity and respect for the diversity of cultures and political systems.</p>
<p>The EU should take China&#8217;s offer seriously &#8211; and act soon, he suggested.</p>
