<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />China&#8217;s mega water diversion project has transferred nearly 30 billion cubic meters of water in the past five years, official data showed Thursday.</p>
<p>The first phase of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project has directly benefited over 120 million people since it went into operation on Dec. 12, 2014, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/19.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Water Resources</a>.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s per capita water resources is only 28 percent of the world&#8217;s average and China&#8217;s water resources are unevenly distributed across the country. Water is abundant in the south while scarce in the north, making the water diversion project a necessary move.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Ge Fengjin, son of Ge Daorong, a survivor of the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1080223.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanjing Massacre</a>, held a testimony meeting here on Wednesday night to convey the truth about the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 and remind people to never forget history. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Ge Fengjin, son of Ge Daorong, a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, held a testimony meeting here on Wednesday night to convey the truth about the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 and remind people to never forget history.</p>
<p>At the invitation of a few local civil groups, Ge Fengjin shared his father&#8217;s story at the meeting to mark the 82nd anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre. About 100 people attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Ge Daorong, a survivor of the massacre, was only 10 years old when Nanjing fell to Japanese invaders. He survived by escaping into the Safety Zone during the mass killing, but his three uncles did not.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, he has devoted himself to sharing his story. As he gets older, his son has taken over.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Dec. 13, 1937, the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing and carried out the deadly Nanjing massacre, killing 300,000 of our compatriots, including my family members,&#8221; said Ge Fengjin.</p>
<p>As descendant of a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, he said he should not only remember the painful history, but also has the responsibility to tell the truth and testify to the the mass-killing, adding that he wants more young people to know and remember this part of history.</p>
<p>Sun Zhaiwei, an expert on the Nanjing Massacre and researcher at Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, delivered a speech themed &#8220;The solemn truth of Nanjing Defense Battle&#8221; at the meeting.</p>
<p>He introduced the historical background of the Nanjing Massacre, the historical truth of the Nanjing Defense Battle, from three aspects: &#8220;the capture of Nanjing is the established goal of the Japanese army,&#8221; &#8220;the heroic fight of Chinese soldiers&#8221; and &#8220;the important historical position of the battle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reviewing the truth of the battle is not to continue the hatred, Sun said, but to learn from the historical experience, be vigilant to the resurgence of Japanese militarism which has brought disasters to mankind, and work together to strive for and maintain lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Shota Naito, a postdoctoral fellow majored in history from Japan&#8217;s Meiji University, told Xinhua that he has been attending the testimony meeting of the Nanjing Massacre in Tokyo every year since 2015.</p>
<p>Each year, the organizers invite various people to talk about the massacre in different places and perspectives, which offers a rare opportunity to learn about the truth of history in Japan, he said, adding that he is concerned that some people in Japan do not know the truth of history, and some even attempt to falsify history, forget history and deny the existence of the Nanjing Massacre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time I listen to the stories with tears in my eyes, I feel sorry (for the Chinese people),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Massacre took place after the Japanese troops captured the city on Dec. 13, 1937. Over six weeks, they killed about 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers in one of the most barbaric episodes of World War II.&nbsp;</p>

(Xinhua/Zhao Ge)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />Leaders of some Chinese American groups have expressed firm opposition to and issued a strong condemnation of the Xinjiang-related bill passed by the US House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The passage of the so-called &#8220;Uygur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019&#8221; earlier this month is a gross interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs, and lays bare the double standards the United States is playing with on counterterrorism and human rights issues, said Liang Guanjun, president of the United Chinese Association of Eastern US Inc., at a gathering of over 100 Chinese Americans on Tuesday in Flushing, New York.</p>
<p>The political move will encourage the spread of terrorism in Xinjiang and have a negative impact on the development of US-China relations, Liang said.</p>
<p>Ma Yue, president of New York Association for the Peaceful Unification of China, said that Americans, especially New Yorkers, understand the pain inflicted by terrorism.</p>
<p>However, by passing the Xinjiang-related bill, the US House turned a blind eye to China&#8217;s efforts to eradicate terrorism, and the move will hinder the development of counterterrorism operations worldwide, Ma said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why conducting certain crimes are defined as terrorism in the United States, while doing the same things in China are somehow defined as a movement defending human rights? This is purely playing with double standards,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>A café chain in Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing municipality said it had returned red pandas, China&#8217;s second-class protected animal, to a local breeding facility after a social media post showing the animals in their shop triggered a flood of criticism online and caused the national forestry authority to launch an investigation.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Forestry and Grassland Administration said on Sina Weibo on Wednesday that trading in wild animals is prohibited and vowed further investigation into the case.</p>
<p>A netizen posted a photo on Sina Weibo on Monday that showed a red panda in a café in Chongqing and questioned if the café was allowed to have the animal. The photo featured the red panda lying on the floor in the café.</p>
<p>The post triggered a social media backlash with many netizens calling on the related authorities to investigate the case and protect the animals.</p>
<p>A café employee surnamed Zhu told the Global Times that they had stopped the activity and sent the pandas back to a local breeding facility after the criticism.</p>
<p>Zhu said that they did not buy the pandas and were not planning to raise the animals.</p>
<p>The café was cooperating with the breeding facility to hold science education activities in the shop and that&#8217;s why the red pandas were taken to the café to see if they could adapt to living there, said Zhu.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the red pandas could adapt to the café&#8217;s environment, there would be activities here where children could learn more about the animals and their habits by observing the pandas and the animals would be returned after the activities,&#8221; Zhu said.</p>
<p>According to the related law and regulation, an individual or group without a license to domesticate and breed wild animals will be fined up to 3,000 yuan ($426) and have the animals confiscated.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-top: 3px; color: #999">Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</p>
<p>The Communist Party of China&#8217;s (CPC) disciplinary watchdog has taken aim at a so-called academic paper analyzing biological causes for corrupt activities and suggested that the best way to prevent graft is to set up a mechanism under which no one dare, or is willing, to engage in corruption.</p>
<p>A research paper claiming that excessive activity and disorder of the gut flora DNA system may be a biological cause of humans&#8217; corrupt activities, and that by controlling gut flora, it would help physiologically eliminate hunger and reduce people&#8217;s material needs and desires, making them more diligent and self-disciplined.</p>
<p>The paper, which has been widely circulated online, has aroused heated discussion about its authenticity.</p>
<p>While some see it as a joke, the Central Commission of Discipline Inspection (CCDI) of the CPC, the anti-graft authority, is taking it seriously by publishing an article on its official WeChat account, saying that rather than targeting gut flora in anti-corruption efforts, it needs more reliable measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Corruption is a common problem in human society, and the causes of corruption are very complex. From case reporting to inspection to supervision and investigation, corruption is the result of a variety of factors,&#8221; the CCDI said in a post.</p>
<p>Various factors for conducting corrupt activities include that current punishment is not enough of a deterrent, the system is not perfect and the supervision is weak, or people have selfish desires, as well as political and social environments in addition to historical factors, it noted.</p>
<p>In this case, establishing a comprehensive mechanism to deter potential corruption is very necessary, as the Party has zero tolerance for corrupt acts.</p>

Photo: CFP</p>
<p>A senior official of the Chinese government responsible for Hong Kong and Macao affairs published an article in the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CPC) pointing out that Hong Kong has neither passed the national security law nor established any institute for enforcement while Macao has already passed the law and improved a lot, and this is why separatist activities have been intensifying in Hong Kong in recent years. The People&#8217;s Daily on Wednesday published a long signed article on its page 9 by Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, headlined &#8220;Adhere to and improve the &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; institutional system&#8221; to comprehensively expound the correctness and feasibility of the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; in China.</p>
<p>The article reflected the study and implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee on the special administrative regions (SARs) issue, while it stressed that strengthening the implementation and improvement of the national security legislation and enforcement mechanism as well as strengthening the capability of law enforcement in Hong Kong is an urgent mission for the HKSAR government and different groups among the society.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Pedestrians cross a road in the Central district of Hong Kong in October. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Apart from national security, the article also touched many issues including how to integrate Hong Kong and Macao into the overall development of the country, how to ensure the central government&#8217;s authority in SARs that are authorized by the Constitution and the Basic Law, and expressed the need to establish an anti-foreign interference mechanism in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Chinese experts said that publishing such an article at this time while Hong Kong is still suffering turmoil and Macao is waiting for the upcoming celebration of the 20th anniversary of returning to China, is delivering a signal that China is reviewing its policies and principles on governing SARs and it is trying to clarify some misunderstanding as well as introducing solutions and plans to solve long-existing problems and newly emerged challenges.</p>
<p>Establishing and improving a legal system for safeguarding national security in the SARs and improving related enforcement mechanisms are natural and have their practical needs, said the article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Macao has completed the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, established the committee for safeguarding national security and its office, and has proactively added anti-separatism provisions to the Legislative Council&#8217;s election law. The next step is to formulate and modify relevant supporting legislations.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong has not yet completed the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law and has not set up a corresponding enforcement agency. This is one of the main reasons why the activities of local radical separatist forces such as &#8216;Hong Kong secessionists&#8217; have intensified in recent years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making a comparison between Macao and Hong Kong on this issue shows that the official of the central government wants to tell the people and officials of the two SARs what is right and what is wrong, said an anonymous Beijing-based Hong Kong and Macao studies expert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Macao is more secure and can focus on development rather than suffering from unrests, the national security law is a key reason. At least it can prevent foreign forces and anti-China separatists using discontent among the people to create and incite a massive political movement to hurt the city,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong to enact Article 23 of the Basic Law, but the Chief Executive could evoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to make regulations, which, however, would lead to a judicial review, Kennedy Wong Ying-ho, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s abnormal that Article 23 has not been enacted since Hong Kong has returned to China for over 20 years. If national security could not be fully safeguarded, it would be far away from the universal suffrage, Tang Fei, a member of the Council of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the moment, the Public Order Ordinance, Societies Ordinance and Crimes Ordinance have certain interpretations concerning national security matters.</p>
<p>However, they are obviously not strong enough, Tang noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It requires more professional and much wider consultation on the matter,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no special full-time police department or prosecutors handling cases related to national security and it&#8217;s difficult for the police or department of justice to investigate and prosecute as soon as possible. Enactment of Article 23 has been delayed for years, the analyst said. &#8220;Because it&#8217;s under the Basic Law and in line with &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; principle, it&#8217;s reasonable to revive it despite of rising opposition of anti-government forces,&#8221; he added.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The press conference for the &#8220;Thunder 2019&#8221; special campaign jointly conducted by the police of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. Photo: China Police site </p>
<p>Police in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province and the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions finished a six-month campaign against cross border crime, apprehending 1,400 suspects and seizing 21 kilograms of drugs and 152 firearms. Experts said it shows the joint enforcement capability remains effective despite ongoing social unrest in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annual campaign lasted from July to December, according to a statement from China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/8.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Public Security</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two rounds of unified inspections were carried out during the period, in which the police investigated 17,700 entertainment venues and solved more than 1,000 criminal cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The police also intercepted 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) and HK$30,000 ($3,800) of illicit money, according to the statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tripartite police campaign shows that the joint governance mechanism in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area remains unaffected in spite of the Hong Kong unrest, Fan Peng, a researcher at the Institute of Political Science under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The enforcement capacity of the Hong Kong police can be demonstrated in the campaign, which shows that the months-long riots in Hong Kong have not affected the participation of Hong Kong police in the joint operation in the Greater Bay Area,&#8221; said Fan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of cross-border criminal gangs were tackled during the campaign. For example, police from Zhuhai, Guangdong cooperated with police in Macao in cracking two gangs and seizing more than 120 suspects in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August, police from Shenzhen and Hong Kong also worked together in cracking down on a smuggling group, seizing 13 suspects and 58 stowaways and successfully cutting a smuggling route from Vietnam to Guangdong.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chairman of Hong Kong&#8217;s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) Anthony Neoh (second from right) at a press conference on Agust 23 to announce the establishment of an international expert panel to facilitate the council&#8217;s study on recent public order events Photo: Screenshot from IPCC website</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) on Wednesday denied its international experts &#8220;quit&#8221; as some Western media reported, saying they had stepped aside after finishing an interim report.</p>
<p>Anthony Neoh, IPCC chairman, told Hong Kong media on Wednesday that the international experts were not resigning. It was just they finished their current phase of work collecting evidence and drafting a report. They had showed interest to come back and help when the IPCC moves to the next phase, he said.</p>
<p>Tony Tse Wai-chuen, a lawmaker and IPCC vice-president, also said Wednesday the international experts did not resign but stepped aside after finishing this stage of their work, local media reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statements came after the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday published a report, quoting the panel as saying it &#8220;steps down from probe of Hong Kong police&#8221; as the city&#8217;s watchdog &#8220;lacks powers to properly investigate&#8221; use of force during police operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using &#8220;stepping down&#8221; to describe the panel&#8217;s normal working arrangement was just a typical trick of some Western media, according to Fan Peng, a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong &amp; Macao Studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The media was exploiting the public&#8217;s limited knowledge of the IPCC panel&#8217;s remit and creating the impression that the police watchdog was restricted from working properly.</p>
<p>The analyst pointed out that the international expert panel, hired by the IPCC, has its missions and working pace within the framework of laws and administrative regulations of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel helped assess the independence and use of force of Hong Kong police operations and was designed to be a consultative body rather than an instructor, Fan noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IPCC doesn&#8217;t have to embrace everything the panel comes up with,&#8221; Fan said.</p>
<p>He also noted if the panel has offered advice, they must pass judicial organs before taking any effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC announced to establish an international expert panel on August 23 and later on September 4 released a list of the five-member panel chaired by Dennis O&#8217;Connor, who had investigated police action during disturbances in Britain in 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the IPCC website, the overseas experts&#8217; role is to provide international experience and advice for the IPCC&#8217;s thematic study on police practices and procedures arising from recent public order events.</p>
<p>Ian Grenville Cross, Hong Kong&#8217;s former director of public prosecutions, told Wen Wei Po on Wednesday that the IPCC has many experienced experts who can do the work in accordance with mature internal procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The international experts were mainly polishing the report to make it in line with international standards, Cross said, adding the experts were not familiar with the situation in Hong Kong and did not play a decisive role in forming the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anthony Neoh on Saturday told media that the expert panel did not have a thorough understanding of the complicated situation in Hong Kong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I already told them their opinions are noted with thanks but we must act according to laws,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The council also included police watchdog experts from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and a British specialist on crowd behavior.</p>
<p>One of the council&#8217;s specialists, Clifford Stott, in early November posted a report on Twitter saying that the IPCC had structural limitations in the scope and power of the inquiry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC replied then that the document released was not an announcement of the panel, but the personal action of Stott without prior consultation with the IPCC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC was disappointed with the tweet, according to a statement by the police watchdog.</p>

<p>Netizens hailed Peking University for sacking Professor Feng Renjie on Wednesday for violating teachers&#8217; ethics and discipline over an alleged sex scandal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The university revoked Feng&#8217;s qualifications as a teacher and disqualified him from relevant talent schemes.</p>
<p>Frequent sexual assault scandals among college teachers have prompted Chinese netizens to call for a mechanism to prevent sexual harassment in colleges and universities.</p>
<p>A sound investigation system is required to protect the informant and accused, experts said.</p>
<p>Peking University launched an investigation on December 2 into a report that Feng has maintained sexual relations with multiple women at the same time, including a brief marriage to a college student.</p>
<p>The university&#8217;s decision comes on the heels of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics&#8217; decision to dismiss an associate professor on Monday for allegedly sexually assaulting a student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar case happened on October 14 when Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University dismissed a teacher who was detained on criminal charges for allegedly raping a female student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netizens compiled a list of professors suspected of sexual harassment or scandals at universities across China on Sina Weibo, and encouraged more victims to expose scandals.</p>
<p>Unlike sexual harassment in public spaces, sexual harassment on university campuses is often more insidious, Zhu Wei, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students in a naturally disadvantaged position sometimes find it hard to resist &#8216;excessive care&#8217; shown by their teachers. It is also more difficult for them to obtain evidence and defend their rights after being violated, especially when the teacher has a final say on their test scores,&#8221; said a student, who had been sexually harassed but declined to tell her name.</p>
<p>Zhu emphasized the importance of an investigation mechanism on campus which can respond quickly to victims. But it is also necessary to prevent the abuse of a whistleblower if the complaint involves a false accusation.</p>
