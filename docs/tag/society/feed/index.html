<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo taken on Nov. 1, 2018 shows the night view of Shanghai, east China.&nbsp;(Xinhua/Cai Yang)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council on Sunday jointly issued an outline of the integrated regional development of the Yangtze River Delta.</p>
<p>The document outlined targets, requirements and measures to boost the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta and build a regional cluster of high-quality development.</p>
<p>As one of China&#8217;s most economically active, open and innovative regions, the Yangtze River Delta boasts strategic significance in the country&#8217;s modernization and further opening-up, which makes its regional integration crucial for leading the country&#8217;s high-quality development and building a modern economic system.</p>
<p>The outline, mapping development for a 358,000-square km expanse that encompasses Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, Anhui Province and Shanghai Municipality, consists of 12 chapters.</p>
<p>Tasks specified in the outline include establishing a coordinated innovative industry system, enhancing connectivity of infrastructure, strengthening environmental protection, advancing public services and building the Shanghai free trade zone under high standards.</p>
<p>The document detailed development goals to be achieved by 2025 and offered visions into 2035.</p>
<p>By 2025, the Yangtze River Delta is to see substantial development and basically realize integration in the science and innovation industry, infrastructure, environment and public services, said the document.</p>
<p>To fulfill integrated development in the science and innovation sector by 2025, the ratio of the region&#8217;s R&amp;D spending to its gross domestic product (GDP) should top 3 percent, while its output of high-tech industries should account for 18 percent of total industrial output.</p>
<p>In the same period, connectivity of infrastructure will be represented by improvements in railway and expressway density and a 5G network coverage of 80 percent.</p>
<p>The outline also laid out environment standards to be met by 2025 in terms of PM2.5 density and energy consumption per unit of GDP.</p>
<p>By 2025, accomplishments in public services should put per capita fiscal expenditure at 21,000 yuan (about 2,987 U.S. dollars) and extend the average life expectancy to 79 years, according to the outline.</p>
<p>The outline also called for a unified market system marked by openness and the free flow of resources.</p>
<p>Looking further into the future, the outline envisioned the Yangtze River Delta as the most influential and robust driving force of the nation&#8217;s development by 2035.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is out on bail and remains under partial house arrest after she was detained last year at the behest of American authorities, leaves her home to attend a court hearing in Vancouver, on September 23. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Calls were still loud Sunday on Chinese social media for the release of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou one year after her arrest in Vancouver&nbsp;airport at the request of the US.</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s case has evolved to be a linchpin in a stalemate between China and Canada, Chinese observers say, noting that breakthroughs made by the Chinese telecommunications giant over the past year prove that the US attempt to contain Huawei&#8217;s achievements and China&#8217;s technological rise has and will continue to come to naught.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Cong Peiwu, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Canada, also paid a visit to Meng in Vancouver.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government is determined to protect the just and legitimate rights and interests of its citizens and enterprises, and will continue to urge the Canadian side to correct its mistake and take measures to solve the issue as soon as possible,&#8221; Cong said, as quoted in a statement posted Friday on the website of the Embassy in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great motherland and nearly 1.4 billion Chinese people are your staunchest supporters. We expect you to go back to China safe and sound at an early date,&#8221; the statement said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition proceedings for Meng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei&#8217;s daughter, are scheduled for January, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has yet to respond to&nbsp;the Global Times&#8217; request for disclosure on the progress of the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detention of Meng has deeply hurt China-Canada relations, and both Canada and the US have staked their international reputations on the case, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US request for Meng&#8217;s extradition from Canada is destined to end in failure, he believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition request was based on insufficient evidence, which means it would be impossible for the request to be justified in the Canadian legal system, Yang asserted.</p>
<p>A thorough and complicated procedure must be gone through before any extradition request is validated, he explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case will most likely either become &#8220;a protracted juridical war that may last 10 years or even longer,&#8221; or result in a solution that all the three sides involved can agree on, he added, stressing that the solution won&#8217;t be what the US wants.</p>
<p>Huawei has also become a bone of contention in the China-US trade tensions, during which the US has launched multiple offensives against Huawei.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A temporary experience store of Huawei in Shanghai on Saturday Photo: VCG</p>
<p>In the words of Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, China has not given in at the trade talks with the US and Huawei has not collapsed amid the US-initiated blockage.</p>
<p>In a fresh move, the US Federal Communications Commission announced a decision on November 22 barring the use of an $8.5 billion government fund to buy equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE on national security grounds.</p>
<p>Huawei said it would make an announcement at an event in its Shenzhen headquarters on Thursday about filing suit to challenge the FCC&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen-based technology giant has reportedly secured over 50 commercial 5G contracts across the globe, with 28 from Europe, 11 from the Middle East, six from the Asia-Pacific, four from the Americas, and one from Africa, the company revealed in&nbsp;September.</p>
<p>Huawei said it had delivered over 200,000 5G base stations and built nearly two-thirds of all 5G base stations shipped globally.</p>
<p>The US blockage has prompted Huawei to shift toward Japan for imports of chips and other core components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has pioneered the nation&#8217;s push for indigenous technological prowess, Xiang told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering Huawei&#8217;s flagship 5G system on a chip (SoC) as an example of the company&#8217;s edge over its global rivals in terms of core technology, Xiang reckoned the company has largely weathered the US attempt to contain Chinese tech products and solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest data from Berlin-based market intelligence platform IPlytics showed, as of November, Huawei&#8217;s declared 5G patents total 3,325, topping the global 5G declaration rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies following Huawei include Samsung with 2,846, LG with 2,463, Nokia with 2,308 and ZTE with 2,204.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highest-rated US company is Qualcomm at seventh 7th with 1,330 declared 5G patents.</p>

<p>More than 10,000 companies could be exempted or partially exempted from the requirement to reduce emissions during polluted days in northern China in winter, according to an upcoming classification rule from the environment authority.</p>
<p>Companies in 15 key industries such as steel, coking and petroleum will be divided in to A, B and C levels in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p>A-level companies are those which lead in their industries and are models for other companies to look to when upgrading and reconstructing, Liu Youbin, spokesperson of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said on Friday during a press conference.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 companies that have advanced producing technologies and highly efficient facilities to tackle pollution will not need to reduce emissions, or will only need to reduce emissions during high-level emergency alerts for air pollution.</p>
<p>The companies are from industries which are newly-developed, strategic or concern people&#8217;s livelihood.</p>
<p>Coal-fired power plants used specifically for railways will be fully exempted.</p>
<p>Relevant companies will be exempted from halting their production, and supervision will decrease.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Ecology and Environment released a direction for the classification in July.</p>
<p>The final results of the classification will be announced by provincial-level environmental departments.</p>
<p>During the press conference on Friday, the ministry also announced progress on pollution-prevention work concerning soil, underground water, ecology and the environment in rural areas.</p>

<p>The Chinese Football Association (CFA) is considering to impose a salary cap in December following China&#8217;s loss to Syria in the World Cup qualifying stage, a move insiders predicted will help develop the embattled Chinese football industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFA on Wednesday night instructed football clubs to halt contract talks with Chinese national players, and to address and prevent financial problems at clubs, moves insiders believe pave the way for new regulations, including a salary cap, media reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CFA said they will further refine existing policies on clubs&#8217; financial supervision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the notice never mentioned &#8220;salary reduction,&#8221; observers said the move was made to prepare for the salary cap system, which will play an important role in reducing the financial burden of domestic clubs and standardize salaries.</p>
<p>CFA will set a salary cap of 10 million yuan ($1.42 million) for the Chinese Super League (CSL). Dual contracts will be severely punished and more players will be encouraged to play foreign league matches, the People&#8217;s Daily reported.</p>
<p>The notice shows China&#8217;s determination to break the bubble in its football industry, which is necessary, Ma Dexing, a deputy editor of the Changsha-based Titan Sports newspaper, told the Global Times on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ma said the salaries of China&#8217; professional leagues have become abnormal in recent years and bubbles are obvious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CSL clubs spent a total of $690 million on salaries in the 2018-19 season, almost three times Japan&#8217;s counterpart. The league also lost more than $700 million in 2017 for overspending on signing football stars. About 70 percent of a club&#8217;s expenses go to wages. However, the CFA failed to conduct effective measures, Ma said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese football fans have always been disappointed with &#8220;high salary, low competence&#8221; of the male footballers. They blamed players as &#8220;money-oriented&#8221; and lacking a sense of national pride.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new policy, however, sparked mixed reactions among football fans. Some believe it is a timely policy to build a first-class atmosphere, while others said the regulation may fail to stimulate the industry and footballers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clubs can still offer extra money through signing fees and bonuses, is that true? And the CFA failed to mention naturalized players in the Wednesday regulation,&#8221; a netizen said on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The notice and reducing salaries are not enough. A comprehensive policy and all-around supervision from society are needed, Ma said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to reports, CSL ranked No.6 on the list of 2018 world soccer average annually salaries at $1.05 million, behind the world&#8217;s &#8220;Big five:&#8221; Premier League in England, La Liga in Spain, Serie A in Italy, Bundesliga in Germany and Ligue 1 in France. China&#8217;s national team only ranks 74th in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China is scheduled to build and operate a space station in 2022, which will accommodate three astronauts, and space would be reserved for enlargement.</p>
<p>Zhou Jianping, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the chief designer of China&#8217;s manned space program, said at the Forth China Summit Forum on Human Factors Engineering that the station, which will orbit 340 to 450 kilometers above Earth&#8217;s surface, could be enlarged to 180 tons if necessary and will accommodate three to six astronauts, Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.</p>
<p>The station will last at least 10 years and could be extended through in-orbit maintenance.</p>
<p>A total of 16 experiment racks will be installed to support hundreds of space research projects, the report said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main goal of the station construction is to realize China a country capable of independently mastering the long-term manned flight technology, carrying out long-term manned experiments in near-earth space, and comprehensively developing and utilizing space resources.&#8221; Zhou said in the report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Astronaut selections are underway for the space station missions. The station will also welcome foreign astronauts to work together with Chinese astronauts.</p>

<p>China successfully sent its 49th satellite for its domestically developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, or BDS, into a planned orbit on Tuesday morning, navigation authorities told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Carrying the new BDS satellite, a Long March-3B carrier rocket was launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwest China’s Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>The satellite will be the 3rd Inclined Geo Synchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellite for the latest BDS-3 system, marking the completion of the IGSO constellation for the system.</p>
<p>The first IGSO satellite was launched in April, also by the Long March-3B rocket.</p>
<p>Ran Chengqi, director of the China Satellite Navigation Office, said he was very confident that all BeiDou-3 satellites will be launched by the end of next June to complete the constellation system half a year earlier.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s BDS is one of the four space-based GNSSs in the world, along with the US&#8217; GPS, Russia&#8217;s GLONASS, and the European Union&#8217;s Galileo. The BDS system started to provide global service at the end of 2018, as the construction of the BDS-3 primary system had been completed by then.</p>
<p>The Tuesday launch also marks the 10th consecutive successful mission this year for Long March 3A series which includes the Long March-3A, -3B and -3C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three more launches have been scheduled for the Long March-3A rocket family later this year, according to the statement the rocket developer, the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), sent to the Global Times.</p>
<p>The developer team has improved the rocket type’s reliability as well as the security of ground devices, Liu Lidong, a senior designer for the rocket series, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>An extra protection device and measures have been installed to the rocket in response to the harsh environment in flight, strengthening reliability of the data collecting system, and the team has also optimized the interior structure of the third-stage engine for the rocket, reducing the stress level of the diaphragm to extend the life of the capsule assembly and improve the product qualification rate, and make the cryogenic engine more reliable, he noted.</p>
<p>The Tuesday launch was the 106th launch of the Long March-3A rocket series and 317th of the Long March rocket family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A decade after McDonald&#8217;s shut down in Iceland, thousands of online users follow the live slow decay of the last order &#8211; a seemingly indestructible burger with a side of fries protected in a glass case like a precious gem.</p>
<p>The American chain closed its only three branches in Iceland during the subarctic island&#8217;s financial crisis in 2009, making it one of the only Western countries without a McDonald&#8217;s.</p>
<p>On October 31 of that year, just before the restaurant&#8217;s closure, Hjortur Smarason bought a menu for conservation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I decided to buy a last meal for its historical value since McDonald&#8217;s were closing down,&#8221; Smarason, who is a manager for a space tourism company, told AFP on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had heard that McDonald&#8217;s never decomposed so I just wanted to see if it was true or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>He first kept the meal in his garage but then lent it to the National Museum of Iceland, after which it was moved to a hotel in the capital Reykjavik for a while.</p>
<p>Now the burger is on display like a work of art inside a glass case at Snotra House, a hostel in Thykkvibaer in southern Iceland.</p>
<p>&#8220;People from around the world&#8230; come here just to visit the burger,&#8221; Sigurdur Gylfason, owner of the establishment, told AFP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hotel claims it receives up to 400,000 hits daily.</p>

<p>A senior officer in the People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force received a lot of praise and laughter when he told paratroopers at an event hosted by Central China Television that he simply uses his face to determine wind speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The officer, Li Zhenbo, was responding to questions about determining wind speed when attempting to land a parachute jump.</p>
<p>A paratrooper in the audience said he was instructed to determine wind speed by feeling it on his hands. The CCTV host at the event, which was held on an airport tarmac with a jet fighter in the background, walked over to the runway apron and threw a blade of grass in the air to see which way the wind was blowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li, who used to be a meteorologist with the PLA airborne troops, then calmly replies that &#8220;I can just feel the speed with my face,&#8221; said Li, receiving bemused chuckles from the seated soldiers and paratroopers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The topic &#8220;wind speed can be measured with the face&#8221; has been viewed 16 million times.</p>

<p>A portly little pig who is a resident of a wildlife park somehow managed to squeeze its way into a pen holding at least six lion cubs it was a bit of shock to both species.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cubs in the park in Nantong, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province immediately corner the pig, which appear to trigger a flight response. The little piggy bolts ten meters to the other side to pen, bulldozing one of the cubs with its snout.</p>
<p>The cub that was flipped over on its back runs to the corner of the pen and attempts to climb the short wooden picket fence, shows a video apparently shot by a guest at the park and posted my numerous social media video platforms on Sina Weibo.</p>
<p>A young handler comes to the rescue of both the pig and the cub, and is seen in the video lifting the young escape-artist cub off the fence and back into the pen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know how much I&#8217;m worth these days?&#8221; asked a netizen, referring to the rising cost of pork in China.&nbsp; &#8220;How did you manage to bully a bunch of demon lion cubs?&#8221; was another comment.&nbsp;</p>
