<p>Blackhall Colliery has one claim to fame &#8211; its beach featured in the climax of the Michael Caine film &#8221;<br />
<em>Get Carter</em>.&#8221; Apart from that, it is like many struggling former mining villages in northeast England.</p>
<p>But the village on the County Durham coast is now at the center of a mystery &#8211; as bundles of cash keep turning up in the street.</p>
<p>Durham Police said a total of ￡26,000 ($33,500) had been found over the past five years &#8211; 13 packages of ￡2,000 in ￡20 notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;These bundles are always left in plain sight such as on pavements and discovered by random members of the public who have handed them in,&#8221; said Detective Constable John Forster.</p>
<p>The latest discovery on Monday was the fourth this year, he added, speculating that a Good Samaritan could be dropping off the cash parcels. Forster, who said inquiries had so far drawn a blank, praised the &#8220;incredible community spirit&#8221; of the locals who had handed in the cash&nbsp;</p>

<p>Angered by foot-dragging by an insurance company in paying out for a burial policy, a family in South Africa took matters into their own hands &#8211; they hauled the corpse to the company&#8217;s offices.</p>
<p>In a video clip that has gone viral on social media, two women can be seen schlepping a blue plastic body bag into an insurance office as stunned clients look on.</p>
<p>After impressing the employees with this unusual act of fact-checking, they leave the premises and helped by several other people drag the bag into the boot of a car.</p>
<p>A man asks them whether their row over the payout has been resolved.&#8221;They&#8217;ve just paid now, that&#8217;s why we are removing&#8230; the body now,&#8221; a woman can be heard to reply.</p>
<p>The incident took place last Friday at a branch of the Old Mutual insurance company in KwaDukuza, north of the city of Durban.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Old Mutual said there had been an &#8220;incident at this branch (which) whilst isolated is regrettable.&#8221;</p>

<p>President Donald Trump&#8217;s spokeswoman claimed Tuesday that Barack Obama staffers left behind catty notes in White House offices for the incoming administration, telling them &#8220;you will fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Press secretary Stephanie Grisham&#8217;s comment, first made to a CNN reporter, prompted swift denials from ex-Obama officials and a torrent of online mockery from Trump opponents.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came into the WH, I&#8217;ll tell you something. Every office was filled with Obama books and we had notes left behind that said &#8216;you will fail,&#8217; &#8216;you aren&#8217;t going to make it,'&#8221; a tweet from CNN&#8217;s Abby Phillip quoted Grisham as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a complete and utter lie,&#8221; tweeted Obama administration lawyer Daniel Jacobson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite the opposite &#8211; we left them briefing books to try to help with the transition as much as possible,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director at Obama&#8217;s National Security Council, called it &#8220;an outrageous lie&#8230;. Shameless and disgusting.@PressSec should be fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faced by the heated denials &#8211; and snarky online gags about the &#8220;you will fail&#8221; prediction proving true &#8211; Grisham said her remark had been over-played.&#8221;I don&#8217;t know why everyone is so sensitive!&#8221; she told AFP.</p>

<p>Let sleeping bears lie? Not in Poland this New Year&#8217;s Eve, where a row is brewing over the decision to relocate an annual televised event with fireworks and partying to the slopes of the country&#8217;s main ski resort.</p>
<p>By Tuesday more than 27,000 people had signed a petition organized by a local newspaper, which broke the story after discovering the plan at a council meeting in late October.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters walked across the city of Zakopane with a fake bear on a stretcher on Saturday, days after the mayor confirmed the relocation, calling on him to stop the process.</p>
<p>TVP public television station, which organizes the show, criticized what it called &#8220;pseudo-ecologists&#8221; and argued that sports events had been held in the area in the past without any problems.</p>
<p>An expert from the park confirmed to AFP that there were Carpathian brown bears in the area, though he said precise numbers were not known.</p>

<p>In a case of reality imitating art, two chemistry professors in the US state of Arkansas have been arrested for cooking up methamphetamine in a university lab &#8211; in an uncanny echo of the hit series Breaking Bad.</p>
<p>Bradley Rowland, 40, and Terry Bateman, 45, were taken into custody Friday after an investigation initially launched by Henderson State University&#8217;s police service, the Clark county sheriff&#8217;s office said in a statement.</p>
<p>It all began with an &#8220;undetermined chemical odor&#8221; reported at the university&#8217;s science center on October 8 in the small town of Arkadelphia, according to Tina Hall, the university&#8217;s communications director.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initial testing indicated an elevated presence of benzyl chloride in a laboratory,&#8221; she said. Benzyl chloride can be used to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>
<p>The building was closed and an investigation launched by university police, who eventually called in the county sheriff&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>Soccer fans prone to seasickness may need to consider alternatives, but supporters with sea legs will be able to stay on one of two giant cruise liners during the 2022 Qatar World Cup.</p>
<p>Organizers said Monday they had agreed with Swiss-based MSC Cruises for two of its 16 ships with a combined total of 4,000 cabins to be berthed in Doha Port during the tournament.</p>
<p>The vessels &#8220;will give fans a spectacular view of (Doha&#8217;s) West Bay skyline,&#8221; Qatar&#8217;s Supreme Committee for Delivery said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chartering cruise liners for fans has long been part of Qatar&#8217;s accommodation strategy, with the country keen to offer sustainable solutions for the month-long tournament, which will kick off on November 21, 2022.&#8221;</p>
<p>British tabloids have speculated that alcohol could be permitted onboard despite Qatar&#8217;s strict Islamic rules governing alcohol consumption, leading to headlines encouraging &#8220;booze cruise for fans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the value of which was not given, the<br />
<em>MSC Europa</em> and<br />
<em>MSC Poesia</em> will be used to accommodate fans.</p>

<p>Three cows swept into the ocean when Hurricane Dorian struck the US east coast in September were found living on a string of sandy islands miles away from their home, US media reported Thursday.</p>
<p>The bovine trio is believed to have swum four to five miles (six to 10 kilometers) before placing hoof on land &#8211; in this case an island of sand dunes and scattered vegetation that is part of North Carolina&#8217;s Outer Banks, the Charlotte Observer newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The animals were recently discovered by park rangers at the Cape Lookout National Seashore, a long chain of undeveloped barrier islands off the North Carolina coast.</p>
<p>Three months had gone by since the animals went missing during the storm.</p>

<p>When Britain goes to the polls on December 12, all eyes will be on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to see if he can secure a parliamentary majority to help push through his<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a> deal.</p>
<p>But also being played out in Johnson&#8217;s constituency is a battle for supremacy between two very similar-looking intergalactic space lords.</p>
<p>Lord Buckethead &#8211; who bills himself as &#8220;mankind&#8217;s greatest hope for survival&#8221; and &#8220;a low-budget Darth Vader with a heart&#8221; &#8211; is a familiar figure on the British political scene, having stood against prime ministers since 1987.</p>
<p>In 2017, he came seventh in the constituency of former prime minister Theresa May and gained worldwide fans when he celebrated his 249 votes by &#8220;dabbing&#8221; on stage.</p>
<p>This time he faces a new challenger &#8211; Count Binface, who wears what appears to be biker leathers but whose head is often covered by a gray receptacle instead of a black one.</p>

<p>Andrew Griffiths&#8217; wife Kate, who is divorcing him, was on Tuesday night chosen instead of him to fight the seat of Burton and Uttoxeter in central England for Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#8217;s Conservatives, local party officials confirmed to AFP.</p>
<p>Griffiths on Tuesday apologized for his conduct adding that he had &#8220;sadly come to the decision that it is time for me to leave frontline politics,&#8221; a report in the Guardian said. Griffiths quit as minister for small businesses in July 2018 after the media revealed he had bombarded the two women with the unwanted messages.</p>
<p>He had wanted to stand again as Burton&#8217;s MP in the December 12 election, but faced significant local opposition.</p>
