<p>Lewis Hamilton will be making a milestone 250th Formula One start as he seeks to sign off his championship-winning campaign in style in Sunday&#8217;s Abu Dhabi season-ender.</p>
<p>The Briton, who became only the second driver to win a sixth title at the US Grand Prix earlier this month, is already the most ­successful driver at the floodlit Yas Marina track with four wins.</p>
<p>Another triumph in the dusk-to-night race would be a perfect finale for the 34-year-old, who can expect a more hard-fought battle next year from a younger generation hungry for the limelight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s inevitable that the youngsters are going to come through,&#8221; ­Hamilton said after the last race in Brazil, where he finished third but ended up seventh after a post-race penalty for tangling with Red Bull&#8217;s Thai rookie Alexander Albon.</p>
<p>The average age of the top three at Interlagos &#8211; Red Bull&#8217;s Max ­Verstappen, Toro Rosso&#8217;s Pierre Gasly and McLaren&#8217;s Spaniard Carlos Sainz &#8211; was 23 years, eight months and 23 days and the sport&#8217;s youngest podium yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m able to still kick it with these guys and so I&#8217;m excited for the future,&#8221; said Hamilton, who can also equal his own record of 33 successive points finishes on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully next year we&#8217;re going to have a serious three-way, four-way battle and that&#8217;s great for Formula One.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hamilton has won half of the season&#8217;s 20 races so far, propelling his team to an unprecedented sixth successive title double, but Brazil was a disappointing weekend with Valtteri Bottas retiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;The underperformance in Brazil means we head to Abu Dhabi with a point to prove,&#8221; said team boss Toto Wolff.</p>
<p>Ferrari&#8217;s 22-year-old Charles Leclerc has made his mark since the August break, winning twice and is set to end the season as the driver with most pole positions (seven so far).</p>
<p>Verstappen, also 22, took his third win of the campaign in Brazil and is fighting Leclerc for third overall.</p>
<p>If there is to be a challenge to Mercedes, who have won every race in Abu Dhabi since 2014, it looks more likely to come from Ferrari.</p>
<p>The Italian team have already secured second in the constructors&#8217; standings but have never won in Abu Dhabi, a track located right next to their Ferrari World theme park.</p>
<p>Even if they have cleared the air between their drivers after Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel collided in ­Brazil, there is still likely to be plenty of tension as they too seek to finish on a positive note.</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi is also the place for farewells.</p>
<p>Nico Hulkenberg is leaving, at least for a season, after losing his ­Renault seat to 23-year-old Frenchman Esteban Ocon, and Polish driver Robert Kubica will bring down the curtain on his comeback with Williams.</p>
<p>Canadian reserve Nicholas Latifi is favorite for the seat.</p>

<p>Formula E starts its sixth season in Saudi Arabia on Friday with debutants Porsche and Mercedes hoping to carry their respective success in sports cars and Formula One to a new all-electric battleground.</p>
<p>French driver Jean-Eric Vergne, the first double champion, is aiming to complete his title hat trick with the Chinese-owned DS Techeetah team in a series humming with renewed energy.</p>
<p>The presence of four German giants, with BMW and Audi regulars already, adds luster to a city-based championship that has grown ­steadily since a financially precarious first season in 2014.</p>
<p>Formula E recently reported record revenues and a first-ever profit and, burnishing environmentally conscious credentials with an emphasis on sustainability, feels increasingly in tune with the spirit of the times.</p>
<p>Nissan, Jaguar, Citroen, China&#8217;s NIO and India&#8217;s Mahindra are also involved.</p>
<p>The learning curve will be steep for the newcomers, in a championship that saw nine different winners in 13 races last season and where success costs a fraction of F1&#8217;s bloated budgets.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will have done their homework. They are not starting from scratch, they have a lot of resource and clever people behind them,&#8221; says Envision Virgin Racing managing director Sylvain Filippi. &#8220;I hope they do really well, because it makes the competition even more exciting, but it&#8217;s not going to be easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Mercedes, the dominant force in F1 for the past six years and the only carmaker involved in both, Formula E opens a new chapter in their 125-year racing history.</p>
<p>Their drivers are Belgian ex-­McLaren F1 racer Stoffel Vandoorne and 2019 F2 champion Nyck de Vries of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Porsche, part of the Volkswagen Group that includes Audi, have ­German Andre Lotterer and Swiss racer Neel Jani as their lineup.</p>
<p>The series reported revenues of more than 200 million euros ($221.12 million) last September and has grown to 14 races, with a first in the Indonesian capital Jakarta next June before a London finale.</p>
<p>Former Manchester United commercial director Jamie Reigle has joined from the NFL&#8217;s Los Angeles Rams franchise, taking on the chief executive role vacated by founder Alejandro Agag.</p>
<p>&#8220;I genuinely believe that we have the zeitgeist in terms of one of the most compelling global sports properties with potential for income growth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think the task and the challenge is &#8216;can we get that audience to grow and be engaged?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia will host two ­races on Friday and Saturday in Ad ­Diriyah, on the outskirts of Riyadh.</p>

<p>Alex Marquez will ride ­alongside his older brother and six-time MotoGP world ­champion Marc at Honda next season, the team announced on Monday.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old Alex ­Marquez, who added the Moto2 world title this year to the Moto3 crown he won in 2014, has signed a one-year deal&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the constructors&#8217; champions.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will move from the intermediate class to partner eight-time world champion Marc Marquez in 2020 for his debut season in the premier class,&#8221; Honda said in a statement.</p>
<p>The younger Marquez replaces three-time world champion Jorge Lorenzo, who retired after the weekend&#8217;s season-­ending Valencia Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Alex has been riding for Kalex in Moto2. He won five races in the 2019 campaign, taking the title by three points from South African Brad Binder.</p>
<p>The announcement means that Briton Cal Crutchlow and Frenchman Johann Zarco miss out on joining Honda&#8217;s top outfit.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Crutchlow, who races for Honda-LCR, ­finished ninth in the 2019 standings. He has won three races and finished on the podium 19 times in his MotoGP career.</p>
<p>Zarco, a two-time Moto2 champion, moved up to MotoGP last season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He raced the final three Grands Prix for Honda&#8217;s ­second string, having struggled earlier in the season with KTM.</p>

<p>Max Verstappen underlined his potential as a champion of the future on Sunday with a commanding victory for Red Bull in an astonishing and crash-hit Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Dutchman twice passed newly crowned six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton in a thrilling contest that had two safety car interventions and saw the Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc clash and retire, before clinching the eighth victory of his career.</p>
<p>His third win this season also made up for his disappointment in last year&#8217;s race in Brazil when he looked certain to win before a late accident wrecked his hopes of victory.</p>
<p>He made the most of pole position and finished a dominant winner ahead of his former Red Bull teammate Pierre Gasly, now with Toro Rosso, as they delivered a Honda-powered one-two for the Japanese company for the first time since the heyday of local hero Ayrton Senna.</p>
<p>Frenchman Gasly came home 0.062 seconds ahead of Hamilton, who finished third for Mercedes but was ­demoted to seventh following a post-race stewards&#8217; investigation after crashing with luckless Thai driver Alexander ­Albon, the man who replaced Gasly at Red Bull, in the final laps.</p>
<p>Hamilton&#8217;s demotion gifted McLaren&#8217;s Carlos Sainz his first Formula One podium, subject to several other stewards&#8217; inquiries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lewis was very quick,&#8221; said Verstappen. &#8220;So I had to keep pushing all the time. He pitted early so we had to be on top of our pit-stops and we had a good move on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could control the race with the tires I had, so, for me, it was unbelievable. It was a lot of fun out there and great to win the race.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said his decisive second overtake of Hamilton was achieved thanks to his superior speed in the rarefied atmosphere of the 700-meter altitude Interlagos circuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was behind so I was pushing flat out on my out lap,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We knew we had great top speed the whole weekend &#8211; but that was a guess &#8211; and I&#8217;m very happy to have got past him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gasly screamed with delight at his good fortune on his slow-down lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my first podium in F1 and, for sure, I will never forget it,&#8221; he said. It&#8217;s such a special moment. So emotional&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toro Rosso have given me such a fantastic car since I came back. This is an amazing day&#8230; I was praying for the engine to give everything it had &#8212; without Honda, it would not have been possible.&#8221;</p>
