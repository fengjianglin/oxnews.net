<p>Kenyans placed first in the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s races during Sunday&#8217;s Nanning Marathon in the capital of South China&#8217;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>Kiura Mugendi won the men&#8217;s 42.195-kilometer race in 2:16:57, while his compatriot Flavious Kwamboka won the women&#8217;s race in 2:45:29.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were also good achievements by domestic athletes, as Wei Guochao and Bao Yuekun finished second and third in the men&#8217;s half marathon race, while Deng Yufang won the women&#8217;s half marathon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The marathon, held annually since 2006, has become a magnet for distance runners in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Yang Xuemin, chief of the Nanning Sports Bureau, said about 40,000 runners applied to enter the Nanning race, and 28,000 runners participated in Sunday&#8217;s race.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The marathon is a qualifier race for runners over the age of 40 to enter the World Marathon Majors (WMM) in 2021, organizers said. Currently only four marathon races in China serve as a WMM qualifier event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WMM includes prestigious marathons in London, Tokyo, Boston, Chicago, New York and Berlin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nanning has established itself as a sports city after hosting the World Gymnastics Championships, Cup of China football tournament and badminton&#8217;s Surdiman Cup among other sporting events.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Matthias Mayer won the first super-G of the men&#8217;s alpine ski season Sunday, edging the discipline&#8217;s reigning World Cup champion Dominik Paris at Lake Louise.</p>
<p>In bright sunshine Mayer, who won the 2014 Olympic downhill gold and super-G gold at the Pyeongchang Games in 2018, clocked 1 minute 31.40 seconds to notch his first win in the Canadian Rockies &#8211; where he had three runner-up finishes between 2013 and 2015.</p>
<p>The Austrian&#8217;s sixth World Cup victory was his third super-G win &#8211; and his first in the discipline on the World Cup circuit since January 2017.</p>
<p>It put him in the lead in the overall standings with 161 points &#8211; just one point in front of Paris who was second in 1:31.80.</p>
<p>Italy&#8217;s Paris, who won three World Cup super-G races last season, was the seventh man out of the gate.</p>
<p>He appeared to have picked up where he left off when he powered into the lead, overtaking Switzerland&#8217;s Mauro Caviezel.</p>
<p>But he was knocked out of the top spot by Mayer, with Caviezel finishing the day tied for third with Austrian Vincent Kriechmayr in 1:31.89.</p>
<p>Paris settled for his second runner-up finish of the weekend.</p>
<p>He was edged in Saturday&#8217;s downhill by German Thomas Dressen, who ­posted a stunning comeback victory exactly a year to the day after a crash at Beaver Creek ended his 2018-19 season.</p>
<p>Dressen capped his return from ­injury with a 10th-place finish in the super-G.</p>
<p>Mayer&#8217;s victory ended seven years of Norwegian dominance at Lake Louise. Since 2011, now-retired Aksel Lund Svindal and his compatriot Kjetil Jansrud had ruled the Super-G at the Canadian resort.</p>
<p>Jansrud, winner of the Lake Louise super-G the past two years, finished eighth.</p>
<p>The men now travel to Beaver Creek, Colorado, for a super-G, downhill and giant slalom on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>Former New Zealand coach Steve Hansen confirmed Monday he is taking up a role with the Toyota Verblitz in Japan&#8217;s Top League.</p>
<p>Hansen&#8217;s tenure with the All Blacks ended after they finished third at the Rugby World Cup in Japan, where they beat Wales 40-17 in the bronze-­medal match.</p>
<p>In a video statement, Hansen said his role with Toyota Verblitz would be more as a consultant rather than a coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a new job which involves me mentoring, consulting and advising at Toyota Verblitz,&#8221; Hansen said, confirming widespread speculation that he had taken up an offer to work in Japan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not as a head coach, it&#8217;s more as an adviser, a mentor, and it requires me to be up there for five to 17 weeks a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is the second big All Blacks signing for Verblitz after Kieran Read, who ended his 127-Test international career after the World Cup, announced earlier this year he was also moving there.</p>
<p>The highly acclaimed Hansen, who was the All Blacks head coach when they won the World Cup in 2015 and an assistant coach when they won in 2011, will be working alongside former New South Wales ­Waratahs assistant Simon Cron who is now the Verblitz head coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity to help him grow is something that ­really excites me,&#8221; Hansen said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;While we want a winning Toyota Verblitz team, we also want an environment at the club that people can be proud of and that is very much like a family, like the sort of thing we had in the All Blacks.&#8221;</p>

Photo: AFP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spin king Nathan Lyon snared five wickets, including dangerous half-century makers Shan Masood and Asad Shafiq, as Australia wore down a stubborn Pakistan to clinch the second Test and wrap up the series 2-0 Monday.</p>
<p>Pakistan resumed Day 4 of the day-night match on a precarious 39 for three with Masood not out 14 and Shafiq on eight after being bowled out for 302 in their first innings and forced to follow on.</p>
<p>It followed Australia&#8217;s mammoth 589 for three declared, built around David Warner&#8217;s exceptional 335 not out &#8211; the 10th highest Test score of all time.</p>
<p>Needing another 248 to force Australia to bat again and avoid a second successive innings defeat, they had a decent crack but were eventually all out for 239 with the home team claiming victory by an innings and 48 runs.</p>
<p>It was Australia&#8217;s sixth consecutive win in a pink ball Test &#8211; four of them at Adelaide &#8211; with every day-night Test played so far since the concept was introduced in 2015 producing a result.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really happy. Barring few slip-ups in the field yesterday, we played excellent cricket in the last two matches,&#8221; said Australia captain Tim Paine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;David and Marnus [Labuschagne] have been unbelievably good. We all witnessed a special knock from David&nbsp;Warner. It is among the top one or two innings ever by an Australian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyon was Australia&#8217;s savior, finishing with 5-69 on a lifeless pitch that offered little for the home side&#8217;s fast bowlers, who were made to toil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was his 16th five-wicket haul and his first against Pakistan, who have lost all four Tests they have played this year after two defeats to South Africa in January.</p>
<p>Defeat continued Pakistan&#8217;s appalling record in Australia, where they have now crashed in 14 consecutive Tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to congratulate Australia and especially David Warner,&#8221; said Pakistan skipper Azhar Ali.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been beaten by a better team. We will take some positives from here. As a bowling unit, we need to control the scoring rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least they offered some resistance on Monday, with Masood, who models himself on England&#8217;s Alastair Cook, playing some glorious strokes as he assumed a leadership role after Babar Azam and captain Azhar Ali fell cheaply on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>His sixth Test 50, in his 17th Test, arrived with a boundary off Lyon, his sixth four, before he chipped the spinner to mid-off on 68 where Mitchell Starc collected an easy catch.</p>
<p>Shafiq, who has 12 Test hundreds to his name, proved to be Masood&#8217;s equal and brought up his 25th half-century with a single off Josh Hazlewood.</p>
<p>But Lyon struck again, with Shafiq getting a thin edge to a flighted ball that carried to ­Warner at slip and he was gone for 57.</p>
<p>Lyon then removed Iftikhar Ahmed, caught at short leg by Labuschagne for a battling 27, before trapping surprise first-innings century-maker Yasir Shah lbw for 13.</p>
<p>Shaheen Afridi became his fifth victim, caught at mid-off by Hazlewood on the last ball before dinner.</p>
<p>The new pink ball was taken when they returned and with the lights on it didn&#8217;t take long to finish off the tail, with Hazlewood clean-bowling Mohammad Rizwan for 45 and Mohammad Abbas run out.</p>
<p>It capped another commanding victory for Australia who exploited Pakistan&#8217;s inexperienced bowling attack, which includes two teenagers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deshaun Watson passed for three touchdowns and caught another as the Houston Texans beat the New England Patriots for the first time in a decade with a 28-22 win on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Texans last win over New England came in January 2010 as they maintained their one-game lead atop the AFC South Division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a big one,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;We can play with the top teams in the NFL.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson also welcomed the opportunity to go head to head with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and come out on top.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the [greatest of all time],&#8221; he said of Brady.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is special for me. Before he hangs it up I had to at least get one [win] on him. I had to get this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson, who finished 18 of 25 for 234 yards, is just the third player since 1970 to have three touchdown passes and a touchdown catch in the same game.</p>
<p>Watson scored the first receiving touchdown of his career when he snared a flip pass from teammate DeAndre Hopkins as the Texans trick play worked in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>His 14-yard touchdown pass to Duke Johnson with 38 seconds left in the first quarter gave the Texans the lead for good.</p>
<p>Brady completed 42 of 47 passes for 326 yards.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Justin Tucker booted a 49-yard field goal as time expired to lift the Baltimore Ravens to an eighth straight NFL victory Sunday, 20-17 over the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>In a clash of Super Bowl contenders, Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson completed just 14 of 23 passes for 105 yards in rainy weather that he admitted &#8220;messed with me a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he ran for 101 yards and a touchdown to help the Ravens improve to 10-2 for the first time in franchise history.</p>
<p>Tucker&#8217;s game-winner was his 38th straight fourth-quarter field goal, the longest active streak in the league.</p>
<p>The Ravens had taken over at their 35-yard line with 6:28 to play and advanced just nine yards on their first three plays.</p>
<p>Going for it on fourth down, Jackson got the first down on a quarterback sneak as the Ravens put Tucker in range.</p>
<p>As playoff contenders wrestled for position in week 13 of the season, the Cincinnati Bengals grabbed their first win of 2019 with a 22-6 victory over the New York Jets.</p>
<p>Quarterback Andy Dalton, benched a month ago, returned to lead the Bengals, who snapped an 11-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Dalton completed 22 of 37 passes for 243 yards and a touchdown and the Bengals defense held the Jets &#8211; who had scored 34 points in each of their last three games &#8211; to two field goals.</p>
<p>The Jets became the first team in NFL history to lose twice in one season to teams with records of 0-7 or worse.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Green Bay&#8217;s Aaron Rodgers threw for 243 yards and four touchdowns without an interception in the Packers&#8217; 31-13 win over the New York Giants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Blacks star Ardie Savea is to miss most of the 2020 Super Rugby season after announcing Sunday he is to undergo surgery following an injury suffered in the World Cup semi-final loss to England.</p>
<p>He is the second marquee player to be missing from the Wellington Hurricanes after All Blacks fullback Beauden Barrett transferred to the Auckland Blues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Savea, a finalist for the world player of the year, revealed the extent of the knee injury in an Instagram post when he said he could be sidelined for up to six months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I&#8217;d let you guys know that I&#8217;ll be getting surgery on my knee that I injured in the semifinal,&#8221; Savea said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately will be out for 5-6 months so will miss the majority of the Super Rugby season with my Canes brothers.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the regular super rugby season finishing at the end of May, it means Savea is unlikely to be seen before the playoffs &#8211; if the Hurricanes qualify.</p>
<p>The bruising loose forward had been seen as a likely All Blacks replacement at number eight for Kieran Read who retired from international rugby after the World Cup. However, a lack of game time may rule him out of the mid-year Tests against Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>Pakistan was battling to stave off defeat in the day-night second Test against Australia on Sunday after being forced to follow on, with Tim Paine&#8217;s men needing seven wickets to clinch the series 2-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The visitors, who have lost 13 consecutive Tests in Australia, were in big trouble at 39 for three when rain forced an early end, 248 runs behind with two days left and their top order decimated.</p>
<p>They had resumed on an overcast and cold afternoon teetering at 96 for six in their first innings, in reply to Australia&#8217;s 589 for three declared, built on the back of David Warner&#8217;s monumental 335 not out.</p>
<p>Yasir Shah smacked a dogged maiden Test century and Babar Azam hit 97 but they were all out for 302 and still 287 runs adrift, with Mitchell Starc the hero, taking 6-66.</p>
<p>Australian skipper Paine enforced the follow on and it started badly for Pakistan, whose first task was to survive intact for 15 minutes before the dinner break.</p>
<p>They failed with opener Imam-ul-Haq &#8211; recalled after being overlooked for the first Test in Brisbane, which they lost by an innings and five runs &#8211; out lbw for a duck to Josh Hazlewood.</p>
<p>It was quickly 11 for two with Starc tempting skipper Azhar Ali into a thick outside edge and Steve Smith taking a quality catch just seconds before a ­shower forced them off.</p>
<p>The rain had been threatening all day and when they returned after 30 minutes Hazlewood bagged the key wicket of dangerman Azam for two, caught behind by Paine.</p>
<p>But more rain soon blew in, to Australia&#8217;s frustration, and the umpires called it a day.</p>
<p>Earlier, Yasir and Azam had kept Pakistan&#8217;s slim hopes alive with disciplined first innings batting.</p>
<p>Better known as a spin bowler, Yasir had never gone better than 42 in his previous 36 Tests, making his 113 against one of the world&#8217;s most fearsome pace attacks even more remarkable.</p>
<p>In a scintillating spell under lights on Sunday night, left-armer Starc snapped up four quick wickets and the omens for Pakistan did not look good.</p>
<p>But the gloomy conditions at Adelaide Oval offered little for the bowlers during daylight hours on Sunday and Azam and Yasir took advantage.</p>
<p>They put on a 105-run stand and Azam looked destined for a third Test century until Starc pounced again, with the 25-year-old edging an attempted drive to Paine behind the stumps on 97.</p>
<p>Azam &#8211; who scored a century in the first Test at Brisbane and is rapidly emerging as his country&#8217;s top batsman &#8211; left the field dejected but to a standing ovation.</p>
<p>The very next ball Starc grabbed his sixth, with Shaheen Afridi plumb lbw before Mohammad Abbas fended off the hat-trick ball.</p>
<p>Abbas made a gutsy 29 before he was undone by a Pat Cummins bouncer, caught at gully by Warner.</p>
<p>At the other end, Yasir showed composure to compile his first-ever ton, bringing up the milestone off 192 balls, clattering 12 fours and kissing the turf in celebration.</p>
<p>He had a near-miss off the bowling of Marnus Labuschagne on 33. Steve Smith believed he caught him at slip and made a big appeal, but replays showed the ball fell just short of his fingertips.</p>
<p>Yasir was then dropped by Labuschagne off his own bowling on 43.</p>
<p>He was finally out hooking a Cummins delivery to Nathan Lyon.</p>

<p>Gao Mengfan of Team Sichuan claimed the national Olympic sailing qualifier race on Friday, as he outperformed his domestic rivals in the RS:X competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a tough race as it was super windy on the course,&#8221; Gao told reporters as he secured five wins in eight rounds in the qualifier series in Haikou, South China&#8217;s Hainan Province, during the three-day competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The win bagged Gao 50,000 yuan ($7,110). Bi Kun of Team Hainan, who finished second, collected 20,000 yuan. Bi was only one point shy of Gao&#8217;s total in the final. Huang Zhen of Team<br />

<p>In the women&#8217;s competition, Lu Yunxiu of Team Fujian won the title by an 11-point margin over Tan Yue of Team Liaoning. Shi Hongmei of Team Zhejiang also got to the podium. </p>
