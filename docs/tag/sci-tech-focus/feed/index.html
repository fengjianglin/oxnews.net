<p>An international team led by Chinese scientists has discovered a new specimen of a tiny raptor in a 100-million-year-old amber from north Myanmar.</p>
<p>The discovery shows the diversity of birds in the dinosaur age and has revealed the evolution of feathers.</p>
<p>The team led by Xing Lida, a paleontologist from China University of Geosciences in Beijing, has discovered a series of ambers that preserve enantiornithine fossils and have enriched people&#8217;s knowledge of the evolution of ancient birds and enantiornithine, according to a press release Xing sent to the Global Times.</p>
<p>Fossils remains discovered this time preserved some skeletons and skin of a bird&#8217;s foot. Its overall shape and the curvature of the preserved ungual sheath strongly suggest it was an arboreal bird, Xing told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The prominent plantar pads and papillose plantar surface are related to gripping substrates and prey. The combination of strongly padded, robust digits with elongated claws was most commonly found in extant raptorial birds, which may suggest the bird was a small aerial insectivore.</p>
<p>The ambers came from Hukawng Valley, a mountainous region of Myanmar with high rainfall and many rivers. Local language refers to it as &#8220;the place where demons live.&#8221; Ambers discovered in the region, which date back 100 million years, record its unique ecosystem in ancient times.</p>
<p>The team had earlier discovered strange-shaped feathers that have an open central shaft. The cross-section of the shaft is in the shape of the letter C, not the letter O as extant birds. C-shaped feathers were not as good for flying as O-shaped ones because they were less sturdy, but they were lighter than O-shaped feathers and more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>The newly discovered fossils connect such feathers with enantiornithine as a previous discovery contained only feathers without skeletons.</p>
<p>Xing&#8217;s team discovered the world&#8217;s first raptor fossils in ambers and wings of ancient birds in 2016. They have also discovered snakes and frogs in ambers.</p>

 <br />The US Air Force&#8217;s mysterious X-37B space plane returned to Earth on Sunday after completing its fifth secret space mission that lasted more than two years. </p>
<p>X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle successfully landed at NASA&#8217;s Kennedy Space Center Shuttle Landing Facility at 3:51 a.m. US Eastern Time, wrapping up its on-orbit experiments for 780 days, which broke its own record set in the fourth mission. </p>
<p>The X-37B, built by Boeing and initially designed for an on-orbit duration of 270 days, looks much like NASA&#8217;s retired space shuttles, only much smaller. It is boosted into orbit by a rocket and lands like an aircraft on a conventional runway. SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9 rocket carried the space plane to orbit on Sept. 7, 2017. </p>
<p>&#8220;This program continues to push the envelope as the world&#8217;s only reusable space vehicle. With a successful landing today, the X-37B completed its longest flight to date and successfully completed all mission objectives,&#8221; said Randy Walden, US Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office director. </p>
<p>&#8220;This mission carries small satellite ride shares and will demonstrate greater opportunities for rapid space access and on-orbit testing of emerging space technologies,&#8221; the US Air Force said in 2017. </p>
<p>However, the exact purpose of the X-37B was never clearly revealed and the secrecy surrounding the project has led to speculation that the solar-powered X-37B can be used as a spy satellite or to deliver weapons from space. </p>
<p>The US Air Force is preparing to launch the sixth X-37B mission in 2020.

<p>&nbsp;<br />China plans to launch the Chang&#8217;e-5 probe in 2020 to bring moon samples back to Earth, according to Wu Weiren, chief designer of China&#8217;s lunar exploration program. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1015489.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long March-5</a> carrier rocket, China&#8217;s current largest launch vehicle, will be used to send the probe into space, Wu, also an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said at the first China Space Science Assembly, which opened Saturday in Xiamen, east China&#8217;s Fujian Province. </p>
<p>The second Long March-5 rocket was launched from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in the southern province of Hainan on July 2, 2017, but a malfunction happened less than six minutes after its liftoff. </p>
<p>China&#8217;s space engineers have spent over two years looking for the cause of the malfunction. The third Long March-5 rocket is being transported to the Wenchang Space Launch Center for a new flight, according to Wu. </p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">A model of Chang&#8217;e 4 probe.Photo: VCG</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The success of the flight will be the key for China&#8217;s future space missions including the Chang&#8217;e-5 probe. </p>
<p>Wu said the Chang&#8217;e-5 probe includes a lander, an orbiter, an ascender and a returner. The key of the mission will be lunar sample collection, takeoff from the moon, rendezvous and docking on lunar obit and high-speed reentry into Earth&#8217; atmosphere. </p>
<p>China&#8217;s current lunar program includes three phases: orbiting, landing, and returning. The first two phases have been accomplished, and the next step is to launch the Chang&#8217;e-5 probe to collect 2 kg of moon samples and bring them back to the earth. </p>
<p>China is also drawing up the plan for the fourth phase of the lunar exploration program. </p>
<p>In the fourth phase of the program, China will conduct scientific detection in the south polar region of the moon by mainly using high intelligent robots, and realize long-term exploration in the complicated lunar environment, Wu said. </p>
<p>There might be some ancient craters and frozen water at the south pole of the moon, which is of great research value, said Wu. </span></p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; margin-top: 3px; font-weight: bold">Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>We could soon live in a world where domestic service robots perform household chores and clean up for us as we go about our daily lives. But what if your new mechanical helper decides to put your laptop in the dishwasher, places your cat in the bathtub and throws your treasured possessions into the trash?</p>
<p>Current vision systems being tested on &#8220;simulated&#8221; domestic robots in the cluttered, unpredictable environments of the real world, are suffering severely from what experts refer to as overconfidence &#8212; meaning robots are unable to know when they don&#8217;t know exactly what an object is.</p>
<p>When introduced into our day to day lives, this overconfidence poses a huge risk to people&#8217;s safety and belongings, and represents a barrier for the development of autonomous robotics.</p>
<p>&#8220;These (models) are often trained on a specific data set, so you show it a lot of examples of different objects. But in the real world, you often encounter situations that are not part of that training data set,&#8221; Niko Sunderhauf explained to Xinhua. He works as a chief investigator with the Australian Center for Robotic Vision (ACRV), headquartered at Queensland University of Technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, if you train these systems to detect 100 different objects, and then it sees one that it has not seen before, it will just overconfidently think it is one of the object types it knows, and then do something with that, and that can be damaging to the object or very unsafe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in an effort to curb these potentially cocky machines, Sunderhauf&#8217;s team at the ACRV launched a world-first competition, the Robotic Vision Challenge, inviting teams from around the world to find a way to make robots less sure of themselves, and safer for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Sunderhauf hopes that by crowdsourcing the problem and tapping into researchers&#8217; natural competitiveness, they can overcome this monumental stumbling block of modern robotics.</p>
<p>The open-ended challenge has already captured global attention due to its implications regarding one of the most excitement inducing and ear-tingling concepts in robotics today &#8212; deep learning.</p>
<p>While it dates back to the 1980s, deep learning &#8220;boomed&#8221; in 2012 and was hailed as a revolution in artificial intelligence, enabling robots to solve all kinds of complex problems without assistance, and behaving more like humans in the way they see, listen and think.</p>
<p>When applied to tasks like photo-captioning, online ad targeting, or even medical diagnosis, deep learning has proved incredibly efficient, and many organizations reliably employ these methods, with the cost of mistakes being relatively low.</p>
<p>However, when you introduce these intelligence systems into a physical machine which will interact with people and animals in the real world &#8212; the stakes are decidedly higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you put these systems on robots that work in the real world the consequences can be severe, so it&#8217;s really important to get this part right and have this inbuilt uncertainty and caution in the system,&#8221; Sunderhauf said.</p>
<p>To solve these issues would undoubtedly play a part in taking robotics to the next level, not just in delivering us our autonomous housekeepers, but in a range of other applications from autonomous cars and drones to smart sidewalks and robotic shop attendants.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is why this push is coming out of the robotic vision lab at the moment from our side, because we understand it&#8217;s important and we understand that deep learning can do a lot of important things,&#8221; Sunderhauf said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you need to combine these aspects with being able to detect objects and understand them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since it was launched in the middle of the year, the competition has had 111 submissions from 18 teams all around the world and Sunderhauf said that while results have been promising, there is still a long way to go to where they want to be.</p>
<p>The competition provides participants with 200,000 realistic images of living spaces from 40 simulated indoor video sequences, including kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms and even outdoor living areas, complete with clutter, and rich with uncertain objects.</p>
<p>Entrants are required to develop the best possible system of probabilistic object detection, which can accurately estimate spatial and semantic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Sunderhauf hopes that the ongoing nature of the challenge will motivate teams to come up with a solution which may well propel robotics research and application on a global scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think everybody&#8217;s a little bit competitive and if you can compare how good your algorithm and your research is with a lot of other people around the world who are working on the same problem, it&#8217;s just very inspiring,&#8221; Sunderhauf said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the Olympic Games &#8212; when everybody competes under the same rules, and you can see who is doing the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, Sunderhauf will travel with members of his team to the annual International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) held in Macao, China to present and discuss their findings so far.</p>
<p>As one of three leading robotics conferences in the world, IROS is a valuable opportunity for researchers to come together to compare notes, and collaborate on taking technology to the next level.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a lot of interaction and discussion around the ways forward and that will be really exciting to see what everybody thinks and really excited to see different directions,&#8221; Sunderhauf said.</p>

<p>China on Monday released a management regulation on human genetic resources, banning their commercial trade. The measure also requires foreign organizations to cooperate with the Chinese side when conducting research on the country&#8217;s human genetic resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts hailed the move claiming it will promote rational utilization of human genetic resources and contribute to global biomedical development.</p>
<p>Last month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signed a state council order promulgating the regulation which is expected to go into effect on July 1, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
<p>The regulation stipulates that China prohibits the sale or purchase of human genetic resources. However, resources provided for scientific research with reasonable expenses shall not be deemed as illegal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulation also mandates the implementation of a declaration and registration system for genetic families and human genetic resources in specific regions. International organizations and institutions will be expected to cooperate with the Chinese when using domestic human genetic resources for scientific research.</p>
<p>The information on human genetic resources needs to be filed or backed up when used publicly or provided to overseas organizations, persons, or institutions established or controlled by foreign staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulation stipulates that all information should pass security checks if it is suspected to affect China&#8217;s public health, national security, and interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conducting biotech research and development activities or clinical tests must observe proper research and clinical application management laws, administrative, and relevant state regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulation is focused on protecting China&#8217;s human genetic resources and preventing illegal access to use them for biotechnology research and development, such as the gene-edited twins case, the<br />

<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/5.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Science and Technology</a> said in a press release sent to the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese scientist He Jiankui in November 2018 claimed to have created the world&#8217;s first gene-edited twins immune to HIV, causing a global ethics whirlwind of condemnation and scorn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This followed the news of Shenzhen-listed genomics company BGI Genomic in October that was conducting an illegal genetics study with a foreign institute and exporting human genetic resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is home to the largest and most complete human genetic resources representing the East Asian population. Protecting and utilizing such resources will not only serve the health and well-being of the Chinese but also around the world, said Zhao Guoping, an academician from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulation also provides a legal guarantee for Chinese scientific researchers to enhance abilities and improve research levels by using human genetic resources to engage in joint efforts with the world&#8217;s greatest research institutions, said Zhan Qimin, vice president of Peking University.</p>
<p>Human genetic resources are materials and information that can be used alone or in combination to identify human body characteristics. They are essential guarantees for the development of disease prevention, intervention, and control, and have become the strategic, public welfare and vital resources for health and life safety, said Jin Li, vice president of Fudan University.</p>
