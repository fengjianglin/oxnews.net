<p>China&#8217;s central environmental inspection is the country&#8217;s largest, highest-level environmental campaign.</p>
<p>Since 2016, the inspection and its &#8220;looking back&#8221; review mechanism have taken place across the country, diagnosing environmental problems. The campaign uncovers some drawbacks of the effect local governments have on natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>In addition to the management of Jinyun Mountain National Natural Reserve, other cases also saw the effect of the central inspection on improving ecology and environment.</p>
<p>Lianjiang River, the mother river of the Chaoshan region in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, had suffered from severe pollution for two decades. Its water was &#8220;black, stinky and full of trashes,&#8221; news site thepaper.cn reported.</p>
<p>In the past three years, after several rounds of central inspection to the Lianjiang River and inspectors twice criticizing pollution management, the river finally saw improvements and severe pollution is a thing of the past. For the first time in 20 years, the water in the Lianjiang River reached Level V.</p>
<p>During the second round of the first central inspection on ecology and environment, about 18,900 cases had been reported by late October, according to the statement the Ministry of Ecology and Environment sent to the Global Times in November.</p>
<p>Among the cases, 11,417 have been resolved. A total of 8,734 involved companies have been ordered to rectify, and 3,157 have been filed, with total fines of 231.8 million yuan ($33 million).</p>
<p>The ministry has also continued the &#8220;beat the air pollution&#8221; campaign, reinforcing its supervision and support in key areas. In October, the inspection has checked 16,100 places, according to the statement.</p>
<p>China launched a series of central environmental inspections in 2016 after decades of growth left the country saddled with problems such as smog and contaminated soil, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
<p>In July, the country started a new round of central environmental inspections in six provincial-level regions and two centrally administered state-owned enterprises.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illegal buildings are demolished in the Jinyun Mountain, Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing Municipality. Photo: Courtesy of Chongqing forestry administration</p>
<p>To recover the ecology of a mountain national reserve seated in Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing Municipality, original residents on the mountain&nbsp; moved out and illegal constructions were demolished amid a national environmental campaign.</p>
<p>Li Xinghua&#8217;s old house had the best view on Jinyun Mountain. The 55-year-old farmer did not remember how many generations of his family had been living there, but felt firmly rooted in these parts.</p>
<p>From the house, nestled deep in mountains and hills, one could enjoy the stunning view of bamboo woods and serene mist common in Chongqing&#8217;s countryside.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why Li wanted to develop the area into a tourist attraction. He spent seven years reconstructing his house, which became a four-floor hotel with an area of 973 square meters.</p>
<p>But Li&#8217;s enlargement and renovation of the house was illegal. The area of the house surpassed the acceptable maximum of 700 square meters.</p>
<p>Li&#8217;s house was in the core region of the Jinyun Mountain National Natural Reserve, where there should not be residential or any other human activity aside from permitted scientific investigation.</p>
<p>Jinyun Mountain is home to 2,407 plant and 1,071 animal species, including one of China&#8217;s best subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest system, &#8220;treasure of genes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;The Jinyun Mountain is the ecological guard of the Chongqing city,&#8221; said Zhou Xu, secretary of the CPC committee of Beibei district, Chongqing. &#8220;In the regions on the same latitude, Jinyun Mountain has richest natural resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Jinyun Mountain National Natural Reserve was established in 2001. More scenic areas encircle the reserve&#8217;s 76 square kilometers, and under the mountain is downtown Chongqing, China&#8217;s largest municipality with a population of 31 million.</p>
<p>More than 8,800 residents called the reserve home. In its core area and buffer area, there were more than 300 households.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aborigines lived here long before the scenic site and national reserve were set here, which brought difficulties in the administration,&#8221; Zhou noted.</p>
<p>It is hard to balance people&#8217;s daily lives and commercial activities with ecological protection. Illegal commercial buildings, such as restaurants and hotels, attracted tourists and made a bigger environmental footprint, according to a statement from Chongqing&#8217;s forestry administration.</p>
<p>In May 2018, the central environmental inspection in the region indicated that 105 households and nine companies were running unregulated recreational activities. In 2017, the &#8220;Green Shield&#8221; campaign came into effect, led by seven national departments, including the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. By 2018, these departments discovered the problematic trend of illegal construction.</p>
<p>The management on Jinyun Mountain began in June 2018 under the instruction of the central government, according to a statement from the municipal forestry administration.</p>
<p>During the past year, residents inside the reserve area have been moving out and illegal constructions have been torn down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the municipal forestry administration, a total of 3,085 buildings in the reserve have been checked in several rounds of investigations and inspections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of the total 190 cases, 184 have been resolved. Seventy-eight officials and four government departments were held accountable.</p>
<p>In July, the fourth central environmental inspection group was back on Jinyun Mountain and confirmed the achievements of the management work in the reserve.</p>
<p>After a year and a half of management, fauna is finding its way back to the sites of demolished artificial buildings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ecological immigrants of Jinyun Mountain have begun enjoying their new life and new identity as urban residents. Many of them have been recruited to patrol, protect and clean the mountain.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Return to green</strong></span></p>
<p>The management campaign has torn down different kinds of unregulated constructions in the Jinyun Mountain, allowing the sites to return to natural conditions.</p>
<p>Daihu Lake, a 19,000 square meter lake on Jinyun Mountain, is home to more than 130 kinds of algae. However, hotel buildings&nbsp; around the lake discharged wastewater into the lake before. Such buildings have been demolished since 2016. No buildings can be seen around the lake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deep in Jinyun Mountain, a horse riding club was built in 2011 on the land that could only plant trees. It was knocked down a year ago.</p>
<p>Different kinds of trees have been fostered on the site, such as metasequoia and osmanthus tree. Chongqing government officials said that they planted tree species that suit the environment here and consciously did not import non-indigenous species.</p>
<p>The four religious sites in Jinyun Mountain also met with problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tiantai Temple rests in the experimental area of the reserve, which means there could be some human activity under regulation. A total of 8,460 square meters of illegal buildings were demolished in the temple.</p>
<p>In the future, the core area of the Jinyun Mountain National Natural Reserve will become depopulated zone and only open to scientific research. The Chongqing government is also studying how to scientifically plan and develop other areas of the reserve, but protection is priority number one.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Starting a new life</strong></span></p>
<p>After the house was demolished, Li Xinghua, the Jinyun Mountai resident, and his wife moved to his daughter&#8217;s apartment in the town of Beibei district, Chongqing.</p>
<p>He drives his white Hyundai car for 40 minutes to the mountain every day. He serves as a member of the forestry firefighting team thanks to the policy to settle down the immigrants from the Jinyun Mountain. Li said he earns 3,000 yuan a month.</p>
<p>Li&#8217;s family of six received a compensation of 1.2 million yuan in total for the ecological immigration.</p>
<p>Li said that living in the city is more convenient, especially when he is getting older. In the past, he had to walk two hours to the nearest bus stop.</p>
<p>Li used to farm traditional Chinese medicine ingredients such as Chinese angelica and chrysanthemum in the mountain. But he stopped as China requested to return the grain plots to its forestry agencies in early 2000s. Afterwards, he lived with basic living allowance of about 250 yuan a month from the government.</p>
<p>When he first heard about the management, he said he and his wife could not accept their house being demolished. But they gradually understood, and said that they &#8220;believe in the policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guo Yonghai, a 74-year-old resident of Shilengbei village in Jinyun Mountain, told the Global Times that he understands that their moving out will protect wildlife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said that when he was a boy, there were many wild animals, even leopards, living in the mountain. But some species are extinct because of human activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guo&#8217;s house will be demolished in a short time. He has moved to a rental house.</p>
<p>Shen Xiaozhong, chief at the municipal forestry administration, told the Global Times earlier this month that communication with residents might be the most difficult part of Jinyun Mountain management.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to get the understanding and support of people and deal with their benefits well… During the management in the past and half years, no mass events happened,&#8221; he said.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">&nbsp;</p>
<p>On November 2, China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> opened its official Twitter account, following the efforts of Chinese embassies and diplomats around the world.</p>
<p>The account, dubbed &#8220;spokesperson office,&#8221; has more than 14,200 followers.</p>
<p>Tweets are often quotes from daily foreign ministry press conferences with a picture of the spokesperson for a given week. Hua Chunying was the spokesperson during the account&#8217;s first week.</p>
<p>The ministry also tweeted in solidarity with Meng Wanzhou, Huawei&#8217;s CFO, who has been under partial house arrest in Canada for one year. &#8220;Light up #MsMengWanzhou&#8217;s way home with justice and warmth,&#8221; read the foreign ministry&#8217;s tweet.</p>
<p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry has followed at least 65 twitter users, including more than 30 Chinese embassies around the world, including embassies in the US, Japan and Poland. It followed 19 Chinese ambassadors. Most of the ambassadors launched their own Twitter accounts within the past three months.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaoming, Chinese Ambassador in the UK, joined Twitter in October and has posted more than 400 tweets on issues such as China-UK relations, Hong Kong and BRICS.</p>
<p>Chinese diplomats making a Twitter presence is fairly new. Only a few Chinese diplomats had Twitter accounts as recent as this summer.</p>
<p>Zhao Lijian, current deputy director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry&#8217;s information department, has been the most active Twittter user since he joined the platform back in May 2010. He was the minister counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan before becoming the department director in August. Following Zhao, Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai first tweeted on July 8 of this year.</p>
<p>Chinese experts said the new generation of Chinese diplomats have been more open and more likely to follow the current trend. But their appearance on Twitter may make the Western world &#8220;uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Technically speaking, using Twitter is necessary, Gao Fei, vice president of China Foreign Affairs University told the Global Times on Sunday. &#8220;If all others are using Twitter to express their voices but we do not, it would be self-deceiving.&#8221;</p>
<p>While noting the significance of Weibo, Gao said that if China&#8217;s own social media system doesn&#8217;t keep track of the world, Chinese voices could lose their impact in global discourse.</p>
<p>He noted that Chinese diplomacy has mainly been defined by a fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Veteran Chinese diplomat Wu Jianmin, who served as the former president of China Foreign Affairs University, has introduced a communication studies course to teach future Chinese diplomats about how to communicate with the rest of the world, Gao said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now China has good technologies, and so many people can speak English. Therefore we could not be trapped by the online attack,&#8221; said Gao noting that &#8220;the voice of 1.4 billion people must be heard by the world.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Children in <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> play happily with a muscial drum. Photo: Cui Meng/GT</p>
<p>Typing &#8220;China&#8221; on Twitter&#8217;s search engine, numerous tweets on heated topics concerning China come up. Many of them deal with China&#8217;s economy and political system, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Tibet Autonomous Region and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The increasing attention paid to China by the international community, especially foreign netizens and media, is not hard to understand since China has become the second-largest economy in the world and its influence is becoming more apparent. One noticeable phenomenon is that many of the comments spreading on Twitter, Facebook or other foreign social media and Western traditional media have the prevailing trend of negative coverage and rumor-based reporting, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Western media, including CNN, and The Guardian, reported the case of Mihrigul Tursun, a Uyghur woman who claimed to be tortured in a vocational education and training center in Xinjiang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Chinese Foreign Ministry and Xinjiang regional government refuted Mihrigul Tursun&#8217;s claims with solid evidence, saying that the woman had never even been to a training center in Xinjiang nor did her son die in China, as she falsely said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of making a balanced story including real Chinese voices on Mihrigul Tursun&#8217;s claim as an ethical journalist would do, major Western media, including CNN which initially reported on Mihrigul Tursun&#8217;s claim, failed to authenticate the story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another case is Western media&#8217;s collective silence compared with heated discussions among netizens over two documentaries aired by CGTN on Xinjiang&#8217;s overall anti-terrorism work and the terrorist group East Turkistan Islamic Movement, one of the major terror networks responsible for many attacks in China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of ideological bias and prejudice, some foreign reporters and Western media only cherry-pick cases, which are in line with their stereotypes of China, Zheng Liang, a research fellow at Guangdong-based Jinan University, who studied Xinjiang for more than 10 years, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, some Western media usually attribute Xinjiang&#8217;s terrorist attacks to the Chinese government&#8217;s &#8220;oppression&#8221; in the region to deny China&#8217;s anti-terrorism work in the region. But the two documentaries aired by CGTN showed clearly that terrorist attacks in China are no different to those that happened in other countries, and Western media chose to remain silent, said Zheng.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Painting a demon</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For quite some time, major Western media have formed stereotypes on China and criticized China&#8217;s political system, a perceived lack of freedom of speech, and its policies in Xinjiang, Tibet and other areas autonomous regions, and these stereotypes have become &#8220;politically correct,&#8221; analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some anti-China politicians in the West, especially the US, are responsible for fostering this antagonistic tone against China while some Western media play the role in hyping reports of China&#8217;s &#8220;problems.&#8221; Western NGOs also constantly smear China&#8217;s human rights record, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University&#8217;s Institute of International Relations, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tunc Akkoç, Chairman of the Turkish Aydınlık Newspaper, the oldest newspaper in Turkey told the Global Times that some &#8220;Western media is under full control of the Western countries&#8221; and they do care about ethics of journalism but &#8220;serve the interests of Western countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The social media platforms abroad are helping the spread of rumors and slandering of China, and even censor voices attempting to uphold&nbsp; the truth, observers said.</p>
<p>Facebook deleted five accounts, seven pages and three groups for &#8220;coordinated inauthentic behavior,&#8221; while Twitter suspended roughly 200,000 &#8220;spam&#8221; accounts created to &#8220;sow political discord in Hong Kong&#8221; in August.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such moves will only lead Twitter and Facebook toward becoming a political tool, or a victim [kidnapped] by politics, which drifts the two platforms further from being&nbsp; a responsible public product,&#8221; a Beijing-based professor of politics and law, who asked for anonymity, told the Global Times.</p>

<p>Kate Dorset (pseudonym), 20, an exchange student at Peking University in China from the University of Cambridge in the UK, told the Global Times that information on China from Western news and social media channels is not outright wrong but is almost always one-sided, only providing a Western perspective and relying on the same few narrow stereotypes and misconceptions about China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She finds that &#8220;every time there are events in China covered in global media, such as banning NBA coverage and the situation in Hong Kong, people will often see individuals posting comments, though this is obviously their individual opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>These comments usually tend to refer to China as &#8220;aggressive&#8221; or even &#8220;authoritarian,&#8221; she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dorset referred to Huawei introducing 5G in the UK, which received almost universal negative coverage among Western media. &#8220;Most people believed this meant China would use it to interfere with the British government and would be a threat to data protection, ignoring the potential benefits of the plan,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>Western news publications tend to provide more coverage of Chinese current affairs and thus their bias is more obvious and perhaps more influential on social networking sites. They only tend to focus on two things &#8211; censorship and the Chinese government, which are generally portrayed negatively, according to Dorset.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not so much that all news is definitely &#8216;fake,&#8217; but rather that Western social media and news media tend to twist all stories about China to fit their narrow or misguided understanding of what China is like,&#8221; said Dorset.</p>
<p>Kei Pritsker, a 23-year-old US journalist working in the New York City, told the Global Times it is now common to see many videos on Twitter made to smear China&#8217;s policies. He said it is easy to tell these shoddy videos are slanderous but some people may believe them since the US media lied about many countries in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people believe lies about these countries simply because they hear something on TV or see something on social networking sites,&#8221; Pritsker said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added that China represents a threat to US world dominance so the US lies about China to maintain relevancy and to discourage countries from befriending China and trading with China.</p>

<p>
<strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Misunderstanding hard to dispel&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Biased reports on China in Western media and online rumors that circulate widely and are hard to correct may lead to misunderstanding among foreigners about China, Chinese analysts said.</p>
<p>Zheng Liang from Jinian University said that being influenced by one-sided reports of China, most foreigners, who may have little chance to go to China, may not properly understand China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US and some Western media are making moves out of political purpose under the disguise of freedom of speech. Their deeds are actually hurting the freedom of speech,&#8221; Zheng said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many foreigners are misled by biased news about China, Li, 28, a PhD candidate in London, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He noted that some YouTube users post content criticizing China&#8217;s social system on their channels. This prompts Li to leave comments explaining why he, as a Chinese, supports the Chinese government.</p>
<p>&#8220;The uploaders are incapable of arguing with me, so they block opposition comments arbitrarily,&#8221; Li said, adding that their content will mislead most foreigners who are unfamiliar with China into thinking their one-sided view is true.</p>
<p>Li noted the irony of how Western social media platforms claim to support free speech, but are censoring and attacking different opinions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xiao Mengyao, a 28-year-old Chinese woman who runs a café in Perth, Australia, finds that her patrons acquired misinformation about China from Australian media and Western social platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always share the real growing experience of myself face to face and tell them the true life of Chinese people, which is not the same as what they know on social media,&#8221; Xiao told the Global Times. </p>

<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson appreciated Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev&#8217;s fair and just remarks on Northwest China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region, saying that the president&#8217;s stance on Xinjiang demonstrated the high-level mutual trust of the two countries.</p>
<p>Before visiting Germany, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev told German media that allegations from human rights organizations regarding China&#8217;s Xinjiang are not true, especially those concerning the Kazak ethnic group living in Xinjiang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The president said Xinjiang launched training centers and it is not true to say China kept all Kazak people in so-called &#8220;concentration camps.&#8221; People of Kazak ethnic group living in Xinjiang are Chinese citizens and Xinjiang affairs are China&#8217;s internal affairs, he said, adding that Kazakhstan would not interfere with China&#8217;s domestic affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry, said at a press briefing on Tuesday that &#8220;we highly appreciate President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev&#8217;s stance. China and Kazakhstan are good neighbors and have a permanent comprehensive strategic partnership.&#8221; She continued to say &#8220;the leaders of the two countries stressed to deepen mutual support and cooperation under the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative to achieve shared development and prosperity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chinese government&#8217;s Xinjiang policies have received comments of support in the international community, Hua said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A certain country wants to hype Xinjiang topics; their deeds are against the will of most of the people and their malicious attempt will not succeed, said Hua.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the six-month of chaos in Hong Kong, rioters have spread a lot of rumors trying to mislead the international community. The Global Times compiled some of these rumors and held them to scrutiny with a timeline of major events in the unrelenting 2019 riots that have paralyzed Hong Kong. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Rumor</strong></span></p>
<p>Hong Kong police were blamed for the death of 15-year-old Chan Yin-lam whose naked body was found floating in the sea off Yau Tong on September 22.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some posts even claimed she was raped and killed by Hong Kong police, calling for strong condemnation of &#8220;police brutality.&#8221; Some protesters and supporters of anti-government movement called it a &#8220;humanitarian crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Truth</strong></span></p>
<p>After an investigation, the Hong Kong police found that Chan&#8217;s death was a suicide and she had not been arrested at anti-government protests. However, some protesters who ignored the facts and evidence shown by surveillance camera footage continued spreading rumors regarding the girl&#8217;s death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chan&#8217;s mother, surnamed Ho, said in an interview with Hong Kong broadcaster TVB that she wanted to clarify that her daughter took her own life and was not killed by anyone elese.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chan&#8217;s mother also denied her daughter&#8217;s death is related to the latest protests and asked the public not to speculate on this tragedy. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Rumor</strong></span></p>
<p>Rioters claimed that women protesters were assaulted and gang raped by police officers while being detained at the San Uk Ling Holding Center. On September 27, protesters assembled at Edinburgh Place to voice support for detainees at the center under the pretext of mistreatment by police officers. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Truth</strong></span></p>
<p>Cheung Po-yuet, Chief Inspector of Family Conflict and Sexual Violence Policy Unit at the Hong Kong Police Force, rebutted those allegations in October, saying that police have not received any complaint of sexual assault related to the San Uk Ling Holding Centre or Kwai Chung Police Station. The police also appealed to any &#8220;victim&#8221; to provide concrete evidence so that police can launch a transparent fact-finding investigation as soon as possible. However, no one came forward to the police to report any specific case. During a dialogue held at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) on the night of October 10, a student claimed that, after being arrested, she was sexually assaulted by police officers while being detained at the San Uk Ling Holding Center. She later changed her story and said it took place at&nbsp; the Kwai Chung Police Station. Such contradictory claims cast doubt over the authenticity of her allegations. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Rumor</strong></span></p>
<p>Rumors claimed a police officer chased and pushed Alex Chow Tsz-lok, a student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), causing him to fall from third to second floor of Sheung Tak Estate car park on November 4. Chow later died after suffering a severe brain injury. Protesters also blamed the police for delaying an emergency medical response for 20 minutes. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Truth</strong></span></p>
<p>According to the released footage, Chow was wandering alone in a car park. The police also provided a detailed timeline about what happened before and after Chow&#8217;s fall. Chow showed up in a black shirt at the car park during a clash between rioting protesters and police nearby, and unveiled messages confirm that he acted as a sentinel using his Parkour skills to report police actions. There was a testimony from Chow&#8217;s friend that provides a clue to when Chow lost contact with his friends. However, as footage showed during this moment, there was no police present at the scene. The police came to the car park before Chow arrived and later came after he fell from the building, according to the footage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ambulance sent to treat Chow was not delayed due to the police. It was repeatedly blocked by road blocks set by black-clad rioters that night. Rioters set up bricks and road barricades as a way to hinder police. The ambulance had to make several detours to arrive at the scene. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Rumor</strong></span></p>
<p>A woman sustained a serious eye injury during an anti-government protest on August 11 at Tsim Sha Tsui. Protesters blamed police for shooting her in the eye with a beanbag round, making her an icon for the fight against so-called &#8220;police brutality.&#8221; </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Truth</strong></span></p>
<p>The police deny blame for the woman&#8217;s eye injury and clarified after the incident that there is no evidence that shows the cause of this incident was related to the police. Some officials also suggested the woman might have been hit by a projectile fired by rioters. However, the woman did not report the incident to police, and Hong Kong police had to apply for search warrant to access her medical record to investigate the cause of the injury. A police lawyer has accused the woman of impeding the investigation by seeking to access the warrants police used to obtain her medical records. The cause of her injury is still unknown.</p>

<p>In the third quarter of 2019, Hong Kong&#8217;s GDP saw a decline of 3.2 percent compared with the previous quarter, and suffered a year-on-year decrease of 2.9 percent.</p>
<p>Bernard Aw, the principal economist at IHS Markit, a London-based global information provider, pointed out that unless a remarkable recovery occurred in the fourth quarter, Hong Kong&#8217;s GDP will decrease by 5 percent.</p>
<p>According to the HKSARG, retail sales decreased by 24.3 percent in October compared with the same period in 2018.</p>
<p>Tourists to Hong Kong decreased by 43.7 percent in October compared with the same period in 2018.</p>
<p>Paul Chan Mo-po, Financial Secretary of HKSARG, said on December 2 that the regional government will see its first financial deficit by March 2020 in 15 years.</p>
<p>Hotel occupancy remains 60 percent under capacity due to the impact of the chaos in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate in the Hong Kong catering industry increased to 6.1 percent.</p>

<p>Fu Dawei, a citizen of Shenyang, capital of Northeast China&#8217;s Liaoning Province, teaches residents Manchu language free of charge.</p>
<p>Fu, in his late 50s, holds Manchu language classes every Saturday at a museum in Shenyang, aiming to save the language. His vision is the preservation of Manchu language, culture, and customs for future generations.</p>
<p>Created in the 16th century, Manchu language was one of the official languages of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) together with Han language, Mongolian language and Tibetan language.</p>
<p>There are 15 languages in China that are spoken only by 100 to 1,000 people. The Manchu language is one of them, Sun Hongkai, an expert on Sino-Tibetan languages at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>Sun has conducted language investigations in the field for more than 60 years.</p>
<p>In 2009, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) classified Manchu language as a critically endangered language.</p>
<p>According to an article published in the November issue of the Journal of Changchun Normal University, only a few people can understand and speak Manchu language out of tens of millions of Manchu people in China. Manchu language is spoken only by some seniors in several Manchu villages in Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province; some language experts can understand written Manchu language.</p>
<p>The number of people who learn and try to master the endangered language is increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in the three provinces in Northeast China where Manchu language is natively spoken, less than 10 people are involved with teaching, translating and researching the language, according to the article. </p>

<p>A recruitment list from the No.1 Middle School affiliated to Central China Normal University ignited debate on China&#8217;s social media platform. The list released on November 18 shows that six out of nine of the candidate teachers in the first round are PhDs from top Chinese universities. The rest are all postgraduates from Tsinghua University (THU) and Peking University (PKU). Some netizens perceived PhDs being recruited at high schools as a waste of talent. Others expressed the hope it might raise primary education standards.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Molding a team</strong></span></p>
<p>Zhou Bin, a professor with East China Normal University based in Shanghai, told the Global Times that recruiting more high-end talents to primary schools is a trend to develop primary education.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/4.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Education</a>, only 4.71 percent of teachers in junior high schools and senior high schools had a master&#8217;s degree or above in 2017, while the percentage in Japan&#8217;s public junior high school system is 7.5 and 15.2 percent in Japan&#8217;s public senior high schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhou believes well-educated teachers provide qualified teaching methods for students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feng Shuo, who graduated from Tsinghua University in 2015, teaches Chinese language and literature in the high school affiliated to Renmin University of China in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Feng recalled, more than half of the newly recruited teachers to the school in 2015 were postgraduates and PhDs from Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as other top universities such as Beijing Normal University and Beijing Foreign Studies University. The situation remained the same in 2016, and the number of PhD graduates and postgraduates recruited to the school saw an increase in 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teachers of physics, chemistry and biology are all PhDs graduates from THU and PKU, and they would take high school students to university laboratories to do some research projects, which helps students to choose a college major they love and get familiar with the scientific researches in the universities in advance,&#8221; Feng told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;A teacher&#8217;s knowledge should be far more than that of the students,&#8221; Feng said. &#8220;A teacher should have a bucket of water before giving students a glass of water.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary education has higher requirements in both experience and skill, which requires teachers with refined and efficient teaching methods now.</p>
<p>Qualified postgraduates and PhDs from THU and PKU influence students in a subtle but effective way. &#8220;Teachers who graduated from top universities inspire students with their own excellent learning experience, which gives students lifelong benefit,&#8221; Feng said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Global Times</p>
<p>&#8220;With sound knowledge foundation and research ability, postgraduates and PhDs also hold seminars and optional courses in addition to traditional classroom courses, which provides students deeper insights to the subjects,&#8221; said Feng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang Jie, a postgraduate from PKU, is a biology teacher in Beijing Etown Academy. Wang started teaching in 2015. She told the Global Times most of her colleagues recruited to the school that year were postgraduates and PhDs from THU and PKU.</p>
<p>&#8220;On one hand, we can share with students our experience as successful learners in the class, which is an incentive to students. On the other hand, students tend to believe and worship highly educated teachers from top universities,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p>Jiang Xinglong, a deputy headmaster of No.1 Middle School affiliated to Central China Normal University, said the school needs these excellent postgraduates and PhDs as they play an exemplary role in cultivating students&#8217; innovation capability and interdisciplinary learning, according to a video report by Pear Video.</p>
<p>Jiang said that a PKU postgraduate recruited by the school in 2016 performed excellently so the school decided to hire more graduates from top Chinese universities.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Level-up primary education</strong></span></p>
<p>Zhou told the Global Times that more highly educated graduates teaching in the primary education sector contributes to developing classroom standards.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a group of 15-year-old students from Beijing, Shanghai, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province (B-S-J-Z China) helped rank China as the top scoring country of the 2018 Program of International Students Assessment (PISA) education test.</p>
<p>B-S-J-Z students beat 78 participating countries and regions in all three test items (reading, mathematics and science) with scores of 555, 591 and 590 respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2015, Shanghai represented the Chinese mainland in the test of the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) and ranked first in the 38 participating countries and regions, according to thepaper.cn.</p>
<p>Shanghai students also ranked in the top position in the PISA education tests in 2009 and 2012.</p>
<p>TALIS and PISA are student assessment programs devised by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to measure 15-year-olds&#8217; ability to use their reading, mathematics, science skills to meet challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The result shows that China&#8217;s primary education is among the best in the world,&#8221; Zhou said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhou said that in China, a teaching team comprised of PhDs, postgraduates and graduates are replacing the old teaching staff who graduated from junior colleges and vocational schools.</p>
<p>Management and institutionalization in China&#8217;s primary education system make it among the best in the world, which makes it critical that standards are consistently improved, said Zhou, noting that some world&#8217;s leading universities such as Cambridge announced it would accept results of the Chinese college entrance examinations as a standard for their undergraduate enrollment. A school should not only boost students&#8217; development, but also improve the performance of its teaching staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without well-educated teachers, development in primary school can hardly be attained, said Zhou.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the beginning, I was asked many times whether teaching junior high school students is unworthy of my education, but I believe with the development of people&#8217;s education, there will be more top university talents go to primary education, which should be encouraged&#8221; said Wang.<br />

<p>A senior imam in Northwest China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region called on Western media to stop spreading rumors about Xinjiang, and he invited more people to visit Xinjiang to experience its social stability and harmony.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my view, it is very good and necessary to set up vocational training and education centers in accordance with the law to protect people of all ethnic groups from terrorism and extremism to the maximum extent possible,&#8221; Abuduxiker Rehemudula, vice president of Xinjiang Islamic Association and the imam of the Baima Mosque in Urumqi, said in an article he wrote for Xinjiang-based news site ts.cn on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Violent terrorist and religious extremist forces once carried out destructive activities in Xinjiang, seriously affecting social order, severely trampling on people&#8217;s rights to life, health and development of all ethnic groups, he said, adding that attacks seriously hindered Xinjiang&#8217;s economic and social development.</p>
<p>He said the Xinjiang regional government insists on prioritizing preventive counter-terrorism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abuduxiker, who was born and raised in Xinjiang, said great changes have taken place in the region&#8217;s economy, society, culture, education and transportation over the decades. But he also witnessed some around him were infiltrated by religious extremist forces.</p>
<p>Some refused to let their children attend school while some are hostile to society and the people around them, and gradually lose their common sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;If religious extremism is allowed to continue without control, will there be a future for Xinjiang?&#8221; wrote Abuduxiker.</p>
<p>To strike against terrorism and extremism, vocational training and education centers have been set up to provide those subjected to religious extremist propaganda with trainings in the common language, laws and practical skills.</p>
<p>After training, some returned to their original jobs and some set up businesses with skills they learned in the center.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really appreciate the government for getting me back to normal life. Now I have a broader vision, more contact with my family and friends. I said goodbye to those days full of fear and ignorance,&#8221; said Abuduxiker recalling what one center graduate said to him. Therefore, Abuduxiker supports the training center from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>Carrying out vocational skill education and training is an imperative move supported by the general public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xinjiang has not seen a single violent terrorist attack in three consecutive years, which further proves the necessity and effectiveness of the training centers, Abuduxiker said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">People attend a culture and tourism festival themed on Dolan and Qiuci culture in Awat County of Aksu Prefecture, northwest China&#8217;s <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uygur Autonomous region, Oct. 25, 2019. The festival kicked off recently in Aksu Prefecture. (Xinhua/Sadat)</p>
<p>Some Western media and politicians turned a blind eye to the great efforts on counter-terrorism made by people in Northwest China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and keep maliciously hyping China&#8217;s policies in the region, a senior official from the region said.</p>
<p>Xinjiang&#8217;s vocational education and training centers have attracted attention from the global community and many people have praised the region&#8217;s achievements on counter-terrorism. However, some Western media and some politicians have misconstrued Xinjiang&#8217;s policies, maliciously hyped Xinjiang affairs and smeared the training centers, Shohrat Zakir, deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Xinjiang Committee and chairman of Xinjiang&#8217;s regional government, was quoted in a release seen on ts.cn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;They neglect the fact that China&#8217;s Xinjiang has made great efforts on anti-terrorism and de-radicalization and the region is trying its best to save people who have been influenced by extremism,&#8221; said Shohrat.</p>
<p>The Western media and politicians harshly attack the training centers in Xinjiang, which showed their malicious attempt to interfere with China&#8217;s internal affairs, stir up separatism and make trouble to contain China, Shohrat noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The senior regional official also said that Xinjiang launched the training centers in accordance with laws to fight against terrorism and extremism at their roots while protecting human rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smear campaign against Xinjiang&#8217;s policies demonstrates the West&#8217;s double standards on anti-terrorism and de-radicalization. They condone terrorism and extremism by hyping up the training centers in Xinjiang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Western-based propaganda campaign against Xinjiang is despised by honest people and will not be accepted by the people in Xinjiang, according to the release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shohrat also asked these Western media to give up their ideological bias and stop making fake news regarding the training centers.</p>
