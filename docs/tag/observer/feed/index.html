<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>China&#8217;s State Council Information Office released an annual report titled &#8220;China&#8217;s Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate Change (2019)&#8221; on Wednesday. The report said China has basically reversed the situation of the country&#8217;s rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on Tuesday released its Emissions Gap Report 2019, saying greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise in the last decade. The report said, &#8220;Despite contributing significantly to the slowdown in global emissions from 2014 to 2016,&#8221; China&#8217;s emissions are now rising again.</p>
<p>But the UN should see that although China&#8217;s emissions are rising, the trend of rapid growth has been reversed. Despite the recent rebound in China&#8217;s coal power demand, China has adhered to a clean coal power supply system with strict standards. China is marching toward its target of net zero emissions, but this needs to be gradually accomplished.</p>
<p>China has been actively dealing with climate change and taking responsibility as a major power. This is completely different from the US stand. Since Chinese Premier Li Keqiang &#8220;declared war&#8221; on pollution in 2014, China has been improving its industrial efficiency and increasing investment in renewable energy. China has also been fulfilling its promises under the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/958199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Agreement</a>. These are all outstanding accomplishments that should be applauded.</p>
<p>But it seems that the US has not shouldered its obligations at all. In the UNEP report, the US greenhouse gas emission per capita in 2018 was still much higher than that of the global average. In early November, US President Donald Trump formally started the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement. Trump also skipped a session devoted to climate change at the G7 summit in August, saying that he is not going to lose the &#8220;tremendous wealth&#8221; of the US &#8220;on dreams&#8221; and &#8220;on windmills.&#8221;</p>
<p>But can that &#8220;tremendous wealth&#8221; help the US escape the extreme weather and natural disasters worldwide? No. In January, extreme cold weather hit Midwestern US, causing tens of deaths and many frostbite victims. In July, millions of Americans suffered from a dangerous and widespread heat wave, leading to power outages in the country. Such extreme weather not only hurts people, but also costs US companies more for repairs. Right now that climate change also harms the US economy. Is the Trump administration still not going to do anything about it? No country is an island when facing climate change. If the US insists on caring about nothing but its own short-term interests, it will be ruining its own future as well as that of others.</p>
<p>China-US cooperation has faced many difficulties after Trump assumed office. But the two countries still have opportunities to cooperate on climate change and many other hot global issues. As the 25th UN Climate Change Conference will be held in Spain on Monday, we hope the US, as a superpower and the largest economy, can meet China halfway on climate change.</p>
<p>China and the US have the common need to deal with climate change. The two countries now have different understandings of their responsibilities, but the Trump administration still should understand that when facing extreme weather, cooperation is the only way out. This is not only for the sake of the American people, but more importantly, for the future of mankind.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>To refute US fears that Huawei would send sensitive data records to the Chinese government, German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier said on Sunday that &#8220;Germany still did not impose any boycott&#8221; on the US despite the US National Security Agency&#8217;s surveillance of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell hysterically fought back by saying that equating the US government action with that of the &#8220;Chinese Communist Party&#8221; was &#8220;an insult&#8221; to the US troops who &#8220;help ensure Germany&#8217;s security&#8221; and &#8220;the millions of Americans committed to a strong Western alliance.&#8221; He said there is &#8220;no moral equivalency&#8221; between China and the US.</p>
<p>First of all, Grenell&#8217;s remarks were an insult to China and the 1.4 billion Chinese people. It was an extreme statement full of discrimination against another kind of value, race and civilization. Indeed, it is not equivalent to compare China with a hegemonic and inconsistent government full of double standards.</p>
<p>Grenell was also insulting and despising Germany and Europe by forcing European countries to choose sides between China and the US. Washington has been forcing Europe to divide on many issues, and this is completely against European countries&#8217; interests. More and more countries have seen US double standards: While the US is hyping Huawei&#8217;s unfounded spying concerns, it is also spying on its European allies. As time passes by, fewer countries will follow the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US will insist on targeting Huawei worldwide. However, Germany&#8217;s reaction shows that the results may not be as optimistic as the US had expected. During the Christian Democratic Union of Germany&#8217;s convention on Friday and Saturday, Merkel said Germany should not rule out any company due to political problems. Indeed, countries should focus more on objective factors, such as companies&#8217; technological security and standards, instead of ideology or political system.</p>
<p>Despite US provocation of China-Europe relations, China is determined to promote relations with Europe. For example, Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> expressed on November 6 their support for early conclusion of an ambitious and balanced China-European Union investment agreement. Many leaders from Central and Eastern European countries have expressed their will to deepen cooperation with China. As Merkel said in 2017, Europe has to take its destiny in its own hands.</p>
<p>China has never told Europe to follow China&#8217;s steps and fight the US. It is the US that has been trying to rope in European countries to oppose China. Washington should not turn Europe into a battlefield of China-US disputes. This is contempt for Europe.</p>
<p>It seems that some US politicians can never get rid of their Cold War mind-set. But 21st century conditions are different from those in the Cold War era, and today&#8217;s China is not like the Soviet Union decades ago. China is not a threat to any country. China and Europe are victims of US hegemony and protectionism, and neither of them can bear multilateralism breaking down. When facing the US government&#8217;s words and deeds, China and Europe must jointly maintain the free and open global investment environment to deal with the challenges.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: GT</p>
<p>US Republican Senator Ted Cruz is creating trouble again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anti-China senator is planning to propose a bill called &#8220;Taiwan Symbols of Sovereignty Act,&#8221; which aims to &#8220;peel back some of the extreme insults of Taiwanese that are inflicted by the one-China policy protocol,&#8221; such as the ban of Taiwan&#8217;s &#8220;officials&#8221; from visiting US government agencies, and prohibiting the island&#8217;s exchange students at West Point from wearing the uniform of their own &#8220;military.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scheme was made public by Christian Whiton, former senior adviser in the Trump and Bush administrations, on Friday at the Washington-based Hudson Institute. Whiton added, &#8220;I hope this will be a good start.&#8221; Cruz has long been hostile to China and has slammed the Asian country on various issues. But even if all his past misdeeds can be forgotten, it is totally unacceptable that he is now advocating Taiwan&#8217;s &#8220;sovereignty&#8221; and zeroing in on relevant legislation. This is a grave challenge to China&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.&#8221; This is the US declaration on record, written explicitly in the Shanghai Communiqué signed by China and the US in 1972.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the eyes of certain US politicians like Cruz and Whiton, the one-China policy has inflicted &#8220;extreme insults&#8221; to Taiwan citizens and set restrictions for the US, but it is exactly this policy that has helped maintain stable China-US ties over the past 40 years. Once Cruz&#8217;s ridiculous bill is passed, it would be an overt violation of Washington&#8217;s own words, would cast all his predecessors&#8217; efforts to the wind, and lead to disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>China must be and will be reunified &#8211; this is Beijing&#8217;s persistent position. China has already made it clear that &#8220;if anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all cost for national unity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill is a bare provocation. Anyone who challenges China&#8217;s core interests must pay a heavy price. Once Cruz&#8217;s proposal becomes a concrete policy, the US will certainly be placed in a dangerous situation. If US politicians continue to interfere in the Taiwan question, they will eventually draw fire against themselves. The worst-case scenario could even be a termination of the US-led order in Asia.</p>
<p>Politicians like Cruz reflect the decline and inefficiency of US politics. They are like clowns performing burlesques on the world power&#8217;s political stage. The worst is that Cruz and his likes are good at mobilizing public opinion, but lack basic history knowledge. If Cruz understands a little about the Korean War in the 1950s, he will figure out how much the powerful US paid for underestimating China&#8217;s determination.</p>
<p>The proposal might indeed be a &#8220;start,&#8221; as Whiton hopes, but one of disasters. Cruz and his colleagues had better ask if the Pentagon is well prepared.</p>

<p>There is a group of academic elites in the US who have kept a close watch on the situation in Hong Kong. These so-called scholars insist on the supremacy of their Western values and refuse to acknowledge the fact that China&#8217;s system is more suitable to its current situation &#8211; particularly after China repeatedly dismissed their conspiracy theories on it. They feel discomfort and try to vent their anger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since US President Donald Trump had threatened to veto the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights Democracy Act, they came out to voice their support for the bill and condemned their democratically elected president for failing the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christian Whiton, a senior fellow at the Center for the National Interest and former adviser to the Trump administration, said on Friday that it would be foolish if Trump does not sign the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shows people coming from behind the scene to the stage. In the 1920s, Edward Bernays, who is widely regarded as father of public relations and propaganda, outlined how to control what people think. His theory was believed to be the origin of the &#8220;color revolution&#8221; concept. Some American scholars may have followed Bernays&#8217; theory and played an important role in the current Hong Kong unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These people have taken Hong Kong and Taiwan as &#8220;fortresses&#8221; and &#8220;experiment fields&#8221; of democracy. Together with Washington, they use the two places as leverage to contain China, and infiltrate education and social groups of Hong Kong with their thinking and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some US academic institutions and foundations, such as the Washington DC-based National Endowment for Democracy (NED), regard Hong Kong as a laboratory and have done so-called experiments, in addition to funding local organizations to preserve so-called democratic rights &#8211; in line with the protests &#8211; and help organize training seminars for scholars, lawyers and civil servants.</p>
<p>For instance, the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions &#8211; the city&#8217;s second-largest labor group that supported the &#8220;umbrella movement&#8221; in 2014 &#8211; has reportedly received donations from the NED worth about $2 million in the past two decades.</p>
<p>According to a conference paper issued by the Boston-based think tank National Bureau of Economic Research in June, some researchers have &#8220;indirectly incentivized&#8221; Hong Kong university students to participate in the July 1 marches in 2017 and 2018 for &#8220;scientific purposes,&#8221; and paid them up to HK$ 350 ($45) for individual surveys. Nearly 850 subjects completed all four study waves.</p>
<p>The escalating violence in the city excited these US elites and also worried them. They were excited to see their anticipated so-called democratic movement taking place in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, they were worried they would miss the precious chance to advocate their political ideas and actively support the US government while violating international norms by intervening in China&#8217;s domestic affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the unrest escalates in Hong Kong, they have completely removed their academic veneer and showed their true anti-China intentions. We have become clearer about what they are really up to. But as it had happened several times in the past, their evil intentions will eventually collapse amid China&#8217;s steady pace forward.</p>

<p>German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom will gradually phase out Huawei components from its core network as part of the routine replacement of equipment, Wirtschaftswoche, a German weekly business news magazine, reported on Wednesday. Chinese Ambassador to Germany Wu Ken said the same day that Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s move would send a protectionist message.</p>
<p>Excluding Huawei from Germany&#8217;s 5G network construction is groundless discrimination against Chinese companies. If Huawei really has technological and security issues, we may accept Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s decision. But the fact is there has been no evidence to date that proves Huawei threatens other countries&#8217; cyber security. Germany&#8217;s reasons to ban Huawei don&#8217;t hold water.</p>
<p>Many high-ranking German officials have misunderstandings and prejudice against Huawei. Bruno Kahl, president of Germany&#8217;s Federal Intelligence Service, said Huawei cannot be trusted because Huawei is &#8220;a state company that has a very high level of dependence&#8221; on the Communist Party of China and China&#8217;s intelligence agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Huawei has repeatedly said it is not a state-owned enterprise, but a private company that has nothing to do with China&#8217;s national security agency. Some German anti-China hawks have been stubborn. They have made a conclusion on Huawei without even trying to understand the situation.</p>
<p>The European Union recently proposed a concept called digital sovereignty. Indeed, each and every country values its digital sovereignty. The problem is the rules and regulations these countries form on the issue and the fairness and equality of the rules. It seems Germany has not treated Huawei in a fair and reasonable way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei is always willing to follow and has been strictly following the laws of the countries concerned. However, some German companies believe Huawei has violated the law just because they think Huawei has a close relationship with Chinese authorities. This will seriously harm Germany&#8217;s own rule of law. To choose or not to choose Huawei should have been a market choice, but it has almost become a political choice in many countries and regions. And it is the US that has forced such a political choice on them.</p>
<p>Although the concerns of Huawei&#8217;s potential security risks have been rising in Germany, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has decided not to formally exclude the Chinese company from Germany&#8217;s 5G construction. But some do not agree with Merkel, and German officials have not reached a consensus on Huawei. We hope Germany can treat Huawei equally from the perspective of international norms and the market economy.</p>
<p>We are aware that some people in Germany are deeply influenced by the US Cold War mind-set. However, these people should understand that any ban on Huawei for political reasons or another country&#8217;s pressure will harm China-Germany relations. Hopefully, these people see that in the context of globalization, cooperation between China and Germany is a general trend.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s move is against the rules of the market economy. If German companies set political standards and ban Huawei for political reasons, China will not sit idly and ignore it.</p>

CNN also offered an explanation &#8211; &#8220;Public pressure has been the driving force of pollution policy in China.&#8221; Yet CNN overlooked the most crucial factor, which is, how did China make enormous strides in tackling pollution?</p>
<p>CNN quoted a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America on Monday as saying &#8220;significant declines&#8221; in PM2.5 levels across China have been realized from 2013 to 2017. But not surprisingly, it would not let go of any opportunity to play up China&#8217;s challenge. This time, it noted, &#8220;The government is facing an uneasy balancing act: it must handle the public&#8217;s environmental concerns but avoid taking action that would slow growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNN said so as if only the Chinese government is facing the test. The truth is, which government is not? The most crucial part in China&#8217;s progress in cutting pollution, which CNN will not recognize, is the power of Chinese system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Xi Jinping warned in 2013 that officials will be held responsible for life if projects they approved are found to harm the environment. In 2015, China established the mechanism of environmental inspection. As of December 2017, over 18,000 government officials were penalized for their failure to control pollution after inspection, and 234 Party and government leaders have been punished in 2019&#8217;s environmental inspection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese officials are put on guard to take environmental protection seriously, and some are even fired for failing to fix pollution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is only a part of a string of China&#8217;s environmental policies. But because these policies can be well implemented, even some Western media admit that China is winning in the war against pollution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, China has seen swift PM2.5 reduction. A growing scale of deserted lands has become natural oxygen bars. Wetlands have been significantly increased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which other country has the capability to improve its environment at this spectacular speed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As India is suffering from &#8220;unbearable levels&#8221; of air pollution, an increasing number of Indian netizens and media have been asking why India can&#8217;t learn from China and reach the same achievements as China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>India has been plagued by air pollution for a long time. Agricultural burn-off and vehicle exhaust are the major reasons. But given different constituencies in rural and urban areas in the country, urban politicians find it difficult to convince farmers not to burn straw that much, while rural politicians can barely persuade residents in the city not to drive their cars that often. Policymakers are pretty constrained in what they can do.</p>
<p>But in China, as Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington, once said, &#8220;If they want something to be done, they can do it. Nothing stands between the decision and the implementation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consciously or unconsciously, CNN ignored that the Chinese government has long before noticed the concerns of its people. The key is not about public pressure, but about how exactly to respond to it. This is the biggest stumbling block for the West to understand China &#8211; while it focuses on the Chinese government&#8217;s challenges, it turns a blind eye to how China resolves the task, which happens to be one of the most crucial issues in a country&#8217;s governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Residents receive free health checkup at a health center in Hotan, Northwest China&#8217;s <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region, August 23, 2019. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>&#8220;The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.&#8221; These words were adopted in the Constitution of the World Health Organization in 1946, establishing the right to health as a fundamental human right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As China has once again become the target of criticism over the alleged human rights abuses in its Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, let&#8217;s examine how the region&#8217;s medical services have developed and the status of the people&#8217;s health conditions there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xinjiang&#8217;s medical services used to be in a poor state that saw a shortage of doctors and medicine. The region suffered epidemics of the plague, smallpox and cholera. It has witnessed a significant improvement over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Official statistics show there were 15,721 medical institutions of various kinds by the end of 2016 and the average life expectancy there has risen to over 72 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A multi-layered basic social security system with wide coverage has been in place and special attention is given to the poor. Just last month, the Xinjiang regional government announced that it has appropriated about 2.5 billion yuan ($350 million) this year for medical assistance for its poor population.</p>
<p>This is big progress. As the country makes strides to improve health and development, Xinjiang is no exception. China&#8217;s achievements have been acclaimed by many international heavyweights, including Bill Gates. The billionaire philanthropist said in a recent interview with the Xinhua News Agency that China&#8217;s remarkable progress in improving health equity and reducing poverty could offer lessons for other developing countries to accelerate their development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has been endeavoring to improve human rights, notably in ensuring fundamental rights and development rights over the past 70 years. Xinjiang&#8217;s progress in health and medical services is the epitome of China&#8217;s improvement in the sector over the past decades. The country is doing what it can to promote healthcare reform and improve health equity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Philip Alston, the UN&#8217;s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, observed in a report in 2017 that the &#8220;health gap&#8221; between the US and its peer countries continued to grow and that Americans could expect to live shorter and sicker lives. How can Washington sit on the moral high ground and criticize China&#8217;s Xinjiang governance and human rights development?&nbsp;</p>
<p>West and China have different judgment criteria when it comes to human rights. But there should be no dispute that Xinjiang, a region facing terrorism and extremism threats, should prioritize the protection of fundamental human rights, including the right to live, health and development. What China is doing in its Xinjiang region is ensuring stability so that the people&#8217;s fundamental rights can be realized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the country&#8217;s and region&#8217;s efforts, Xinjiang is embracing its best time in history with improved livelihood, social stability, security and economic development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to improve human rights there is to continue the current governance, and not be influenced by Western criticisms that are full of arrogance, prejudice and lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The New York Times published an article titled &#8220;Can Hong Kong&#8217;s courts save the city?&#8221; on Saturday. The author, Audrey Eu Yuet-mee, is a barrister and former Hong Kong legislator. In the article she wrote she has been using &#8220;legal action&#8221; to help the protesters. &#8220;The rule of law cannot survive&#8221; if the government &#8220;does not respect fair play, freedom or democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disappointedly, Hong Kong&#8217;s High Court announced on Monday that the anti-mask law was &#8220;unconstitutional.&#8221; The ruling will seriously hamper Hong Kong police operations against violence and to restore order.</p>
<p>The concept of Hong Kong&#8217;s rule of law is broken. Who does Hong Kong&#8217;s law protect, the ordinary people and the police, or the violent black-clad rioters? Unfortunately, many people in Hong Kong and Western countries agree with the New York Times article. In their opinion, laws and regulations are meant to protect the so-called underprivileged protesters and to restrict the police. This is a completely wrong view of law.</p>
<p>It makes sense to launch an investigation. But why do these people only aim at investigating the police and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, rather than investigating what people have been instigating, encouraging and hyping terror-like violence in the city?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the article, Audrey Eu said she helped Jacky So Tsun-fung, president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) student union, who wanted to apply for an urgent injunction to stop the police from breaching the campus without a warrant. It goes without saying that such an injunction should not be passed. If Hong Kong&#8217;s law helps the rampant rioters in such a way, then the law is completely useless.</p>
<p>Hong Kong must fix such a reverse concept of the rule of law. Hongkongers should understand who resorted to violence first and who destroyed the city first. If the mob had not broken the law first, Hong Kong police would not have to operate against them. Some ill-intentioned people have been calling white black and distorting the truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, Eu said &#8220;whatever the protesters were doing did not justify the authorities&#8217; disproportionate response,&#8221; adding that even CUHK&#8217;s current vice chancellor Rocky S. Tuan was tear-gassed. However, the fact is the police had no choice but to stop the rioters from throwing debris from an overpass endangering ordinary people and agreed with Tuan that the police would withdraw as soon as rioters stop throwing. But the mob did not stop after the police left. How can this be regarded as &#8220;disproportionate?&#8221;</p>
<p>The rioters have been creating rumors, smearing the police and intensifying the condition only to advocate for themselves. If even Hong Kong&#8217;s law condones these rioters of their crimes, then Hong Kong&#8217;s situation will be further shadowed.</p>
<p>The rule of law can save Hong Kong, but the premise is that the rioters must be punished. The mob&#8217;s terror-like violence is bound to be punished. Eu said &#8220;the rule of law cannot survive,&#8221; but it is precisely people like her who are pushing Hong Kong&#8217;s rule of law into the abyss. Just like the rioters, the judges and lawyers who absolve rioters of their crimes will be despised.</p>

<p>What is a child supposed to do at the age of 11 or 12? The answer should be a list of beautiful things. But in Hong Kong, a child that young could be arrested for illegal acts in unlawful assemblies carrying offensive weapons such as Molotov cocktails or metal poles for attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) seems self-satisfied in its new findings about the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//content/968898.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hong Kong riot</a>s. In an article entitled &#8220;The 11-Year-Old Dissident: Hong Kong&#8217;s Schoolchildren Fuel Protests,&#8221; it stressed that &#8220;more than a third of 4,000 protesters arrested are age 20 and younger… The youngest protester arrested is 11.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, does the WSJ believe an 11-year-old&#8217;s inclination toward violence should be encouraged?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is unfortunate to see young protesters in Hong Kong destroy public facilities, attack police and even innocent people who disagree with them, without the rationality of listening to what others have to say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one would believe turning that way is the natural process of growing up. There can thus only be one answer &#8211; young people, who easily absorb everything and are not mature enough to judge, are being utilized by certain forces with ulterior motives. All in all, this is a failure of Hong Kong&#8217;s education and their parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The young Hongkongers, who have no idea what democracy is, are becoming destroyers of democracy. There are reasons for that. Some radical parents have been taking their children to the protests and they witness how riots occur. Some protest organizers instigate teenagers to participate in destructive actions. Some schools and educators are instilling radical thoughts in their students, and social media, which is spreading information, including rumors and misleading messages, at an unprecedentedly rapid speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When young rioters in Hong Kong think they are pursuing democracy, they have only shown they are in desperate need of democracy 101 education. Real democracy needs rationality, and it needs people who abide by the law when voicing their opinions and who are willing to believe that those who hold different views are entitled to the same rights as others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not allowing disagreements and turning violent once their demands are not met is not democracy, neither is blocking roads or setting metro stations and universities on fire. Such behavior is not democratic, but could invite anarchy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong put it, the five demands raised by the Hong Kong protesters are not meant to solve Hong Kong&#8217;s problems, but &#8220;are intended to humiliate and bring down the government.&#8221; What is happening in Hong Kong is becoming a violent movement to subvert the city&#8217;s current system. Any legal government would not allow it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Western media have also woken up to the fact. Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung published an article on Friday, saying that whoever fights for democracy must accept counterviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The educational environment for young Hongkongers needs urgent reforms. It is not only about their concept of history, but more importantly, about the real meaning of democracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cotton is the latest tool some Western media outlets, human rights groups and observers use to slander the human rights situation in Northwest China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Claiming that cotton products from Xinjiang are tainted by the &#8220;forced labor&#8221; of Uyghurs, they are demanding that global brands, such as Japanese retailers Muji and Uniqlo, stop buying cotton from their Xinjiang-based suppliers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t be sure that you don&#8217;t have coerced labor in your supply chain if you do cotton business in China,&#8221; Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, was quoted as saying in a BBC report on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does cotton symbolize human rights violations or improved human rights in Xinjiang? Let&#8217;s take a look at what has happened to the region&#8217;s cotton and textile industry in recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xinjiang is China&#8217;s largest cotton production base, accounting for over 80 percent of China&#8217;s total cotton output. Thanks to good natural ecological conditions and agricultural modernization, the region boasts top-quality cotton and high-efficiency in production. According to a national plan, the cotton-rich region will be built into a major textile and clothing manufacturing base by 2020. Stimulated by preferential policies from the central and regional governments, an increasing number of textile companies have moved to the autonomous region from across the country, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and boosting the livelihood of local people. It&#8217;s expected that 1 million jobs will be created by 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claims that cotton is produced by forced labor in Xinjiang are based on speculations that Uyghurs in the region&#8217;s vocational education and training centers, what the West calls &#8220;reeducation camp,&#8221; were &#8220;persecuted&#8221; and &#8220;forced to do unpaid labor.&#8221; But the reality is in those centers, as many foreign diplomats, media people and scholars who visited there have seen, trainees learn language, basic law and working skills that would help them return to society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Val Thompson, founder and publisher of the Houston-based International Focus Magazine, wrote after interviewing the trainees: &#8220;I interviewed several of them; they seemed very happy… For those who want to believe these young people may have been coerced, I say you can&#8217;t fake happiness; and happiness is exactly what I saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Western countries and organizations deliberately turn a blind eye to that fact. They are in no position to talk about human rights with China. Cotton, in the history of Western imperial expansion, was a symbol of Western encroachment on human rights. Many Asian, African, and Latin American farmers were forcibly turned into farm laborers on white-owned cotton plantations. But what the plant has brought to Xinjiang benefits the local people.</p>
<p>For nearly three years, no violent terrorist attacks have taken place in Xinjiang. Local people&#8217;s livelihood, boosted by industries such as agriculture, energy and textile, continues to improve. The Xinjiang autonomous region&#8217;s per capita GDP was 49,000 yuan ($6,879) in 2018, more than three times that of India, one of the world&#8217;s largest cotton producers. Isn&#8217;t this the greatest achievement in human rights protection in Xinjiang?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>More foreign enterprises are welcome to enter the cotton business in Xinjiang and contribute to the region&#8217;s human rights development.&nbsp;</p>
