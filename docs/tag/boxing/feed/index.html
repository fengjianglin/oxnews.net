<p>World heavyweight champion Andy Ruiz Jr said he was the more skilled fighter and Briton Anthony Joshua will have to rethink his strategy in their ­December 7 title rematch.</p>
<p>Mexican-American Ruiz produced one of boxing&#8217;s biggest upsets when he dethroned the previously undefeated world champion Joshua with a seventh-round stoppage at New York&#8217;s Madison Square Garden in June.</p>
<p>Their second WBA, IBF and WBO title showdown &#8211; dubbed the &#8220;Clash on the Dunes&#8221; &#8211; takes place in Saudi Arabia ­after former Olympic champion Joshua triggered a rematch clause and Ruiz said the fans can expect &#8220;fireworks&#8221; when they slug it out again.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to try to make adjustments. I don&#8217;t know if he wants to exchange punches, but I&#8217;d love for him to do that because I&#8217;m the more skilled boxer,&#8221; Ruiz said in an interview published on Saturday by The Telegraph.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll try to box me round and use his jab. But for how long? How long can he keep me away from hunting him down? That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been working on most of all right now, heading into the fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fight fans are&#8230; going to see a lot of fireworks. If he knocks me down, I&#8217;m going to get up and knock him down. I know he&#8217;ll try to do the same if I knock him down. The main thing is to stay focused and disciplined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joshua was dropped to the canvas four times in the June bout and Ruiz, who has never been knocked out in his career, said that he would look to control the fight and use his speed against his taller opponent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to impose myself in this fight, but I don&#8217;t want to overlook him,&#8221; Ruiz added. &#8220;He&#8217;s still a dangerous fighter. I respect him and all the fighters who risk their lives inside the ring&#8230; He&#8217;s going to have some tricks up his sleeve and it&#8217;s my job to not let that affect me. The main thing is pressure, throw combinations and use my speed. I can&#8217;t let him grow balls in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unbeaten Deontay Wilder landed a devastating right hand to knock out Luis Ortiz in the seventh round and retain his World Boxing Council heavyweight title.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Wilder remains on course to achieve his goal of unifying all four heavyweight belts despite being largely outboxed by Ortiz before the explosive one-punch finish at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas late Saturday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I see the right shot, it is baby good night,&#8221; Wilder said.</p>
<p>Unbeaten in 43 fights, Wilder showed why he is widely regarded as the most destructive puncher in the resurgent heavyweight division.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Bronze Bomber&#8221; recorded his 10th straight title defence to equal Muhammad Ali who achieved the feat between 1974 and 1978. Only four heavyweights in the history of boxing have made more than 10 consecutive title defences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wilder waited patiently for his big moment and when it came, with just nine seconds left in the round, it was stunning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He followed a pawing jab with a crushing straight right that sent Ortiz&#8217;s head snapping back and his body crashing into the ropes before landing on the canvas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a punch intended to hurt for sure,&#8221; said the American. &#8220;I got him at the right angle, my feet were planted perfectly and I felt the torque.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ortiz tried to get up but he clearly could not continue. The fight was officially stopped at 2:51 of the seventh.</p>
<p>It was a repeat of their 2018 fight where Wilder had battled adversity to deliver a 10th-round stoppage.</p>
<p>Wilder&#8217;s win now sets up another money-spinning rematch with Tyson Fury scheduled for February.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If he comes through that a unification showdown against the winner of next month&#8217;s rematch between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz in Saudi Arabia for the other three major heavyweight belts could follow.</p>
<p>The fights with Fury, and Ruiz or Joshua, would generate millions for Wilder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last two years in heavyweight boxing have provided plenty of rousing matchups and renewed enthusiasm in contrast to the previous 15 years or so which were dominated by the Klitschko brothers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking for a unification bout,&#8221; Wilder said. &#8220;I want one champion, one face, one name that goes by Deontay Wilder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The heavyweight division is too small to have so many belts lingering around. It should be just be one champion and I think I am the perfect man for that job.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 40-year-old Ortiz, who was coming off three straight victories, was trying to become the first Cuban to win the world heavyweight title.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is boxing. I told everyone it wasn&#8217;t going to go 12 rounds,&#8221; said Ortiz.Unbeaten Wilder KOs Ortiz</p>

<p>China&#8217;s Xu Can retained his World Boxing Association featherweight title with an impressive 12-round unanimous decision over previously unbeaten Manny Robles III in ­Indio, California on Saturday.</p>
<p>Xu lived up to his &#8220;Monster&#8221; nickname, pummeling Robles in an action-packed bout to take the decision by the wide margins of 120-108, 119-109 and 118-110 on the scorecards.</p>
<p>Xu improved to 18-2 with three knockouts, capping a year that saw him claim the lesser of the WBA&#8217;s two world titles at featherweight with an upset of Puerto Rico&#8217;s Jesus Rojas in Houston in January &#8211; a ­victory that announced him on the world stage.</p>
<p>He successfully defended the title at the first attempt when he stopped former champion Shun Kubo of Japan in six rounds in Fuzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangxi Province in May.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old is just the third Chinese boxer in ­history to have won a world title, after minimumweight Xiong Chaozhong and flyweight Zou Shiming.</p>
<p>He could find himself in the mix for the more elite version of the crown &#8211; the WBA&#8217;s &#8220;super&#8221; world title &#8211; since the holder of that belt, Leo Santa Cruz, stepped up in weight to claim the vacant WBA super featherweight &#8220;super&#8221; title with a unanimous decision over Miguel Michoacan in Las Vegas on Saturday.</p>
<p>Xu fans made their presence felt with Chinese flags and banners at the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino, and their fighter gave them what they came for.</p>
<p>Robles fell to 18-1 with eight wins inside the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We trained very hard in the camp, three months for the fight,&#8221; said Xu Can afterward. &#8220;We wanted to show everybody in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked whom he ­wanted to fight next, Xu replied, &#8220;Josh [Harrington]! You coming out? Now I&#8217;m here. You see I&#8217;m here, right? Let&#8217;s fight. Let&#8217;s unify.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he said he could fight &#8220;anywhere.&#8221; &#8220;I can fight anywhere. I promise I will bring the belt back home to China.&#8221;</p>
