<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Masked rioters hurl petro bombs in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of Appeal lifted a mask ban on Tuesday by refusing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government&#8217;s request to suspend an earlier ruling by the High Court of HKSAR that found it &#8220;unconstitutional,&#8221; in a move which solicitors said is unhelpful to end violence and chaos which has rocked the city for six months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The High Court ruled the anti-mask law enforced by the city government to quell months-long radical protests was &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; on November 18, but the Court of Appeal set aside two days, January 9 and 10, for the appeal to be heard, Hong Kong media reported.</p>
<p>This means the anti-mask law has been lifted, but if the appeal succeeds in January, the law will be reinforced. &#8220;So before the appeal is heard, if the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC) issues an interpretation of the Basic Law, this would be very helpful for the appeal,&#8221; Kennedy Wong Ying-ho, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On November 19, after the High Court&#8217;s ruling, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the NPC expressed deep concern over the ruling related to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, saying that only the Standing Committee of the NPC can judge and decide whether Hong Kong laws are in line with the Basic Law.</p>
<p>Yang Guang, spokesperson of the State Council&#8217;s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, also said on November 19 that Hong Kong&#8217;s High Court ruling on anti-mask law is not in line with the Basic Law, posing a blatant challenge to the authority of the Standing Committee of the NPC and the chief executive of HKSAR, which will lead to negative consequences in social and political aspects.</p>
<p>Lifting the mask ban is unhelpful for the HKSAR government and the police to stop violence and chaos in Hong Kong, despite the central government and national leaders have expressed their support to the government, the police and judicial bodies of HKSAR to work together to restore public order, Wong noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, the facts that we see show that judicial bodies are not very cooperative to some extent,&#8221; Wong noted.</p>
<p>Acting High Court chief judge Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor and Court of Appeal vice-president Johnson Lam Man-hon on Tuesday said they were satisfied the government appeal was &#8220;reasonably arguable&#8221; but found that the authorities had failed to show a need to further suspend the lower court&#8217;s declaration of unconstitutionality and refused the application, the South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the judges also warned their decision &#8220;is not and should not be regarded as an encouragement or condonation for any person to cover their face&#8221; in situations previously caught by the ban.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have in no way determined the appeals one way or the other,&#8221; Poon wrote. &#8220;If one is to continue to wear masks &#8230; in the meantime, he has to face the inherent risk of having acted contrary to the law should the [HKSAR government] later succeed on appeal.&#8221;</p>

<p>As more detailed evidence about the case of Meng Wanzhou emerged, experts called on Canada to respect the rule of law and correct errors in law enforcement procedures, saying that the arrest of Huawei&#8217;s chief financial officer was purely politically driven.</p>
<p>Meng is facing extradition to the US for alleged bank fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She was arrested at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian authorities at the request of the US on December 1, 2018, and has been held under house arrest since then.</p>
<p>Now detailed documents provided to the Global Times by sources close to the matter suggest that the arrest of Meng was a politically driven trap jointly colluded by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) that included abuse of law enforcement procedures and violations of the law for US political purposes: The border agency abused its inspection powers to conduct an illegal covert criminal investigation.</p>
<p>The documents show that CBSA staff arrested Meng on December 1 and sealed her phone in a mylar bag that blocked signals and forced her to give out the phone PIN code then transferred it to the police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Routine border inspection does not include a probe of a subject&#8217;s electronic equipment and the agency has no mylar bags which had been provided by RCMP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mounted Police work notes showed that the FBI had clearly brought up that Meng&#8217;s electronic devices should be seized when she was arrested. Meng&#8217;s lawyers question the way the Canadian authorities handled the case, as the CBSA forced Meng to give out her phone passwords and hand over serial numbers to the police.</p>
<p>Canada&#8217;s border security agency has admitted this was an &#8220;error,&#8221; according to a court document previously filed.</p>
<p>CBSA officers also questioned Meng for three hours, before the police executed a provisional warrant of arrest on December 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few minutes before the three-hour questioning ended, Meng was forced to hand over passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts say that her rights were infringed even before she was arrested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;A person being arrested has the constitutional right to be promptly informed of the charges and to receive legal counsel in a timely manner.&#8221; Yue Dongxiao, a US-based lawyer who is closely observing the lawsuit, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meng accuses Canadian authorities of deceiving her into providing passwords to her electronic devices under the false pretense of a routine border check,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such conduct infringed on Meng&#8217;s fundamental rights, including her right to remain silent and right to counsel during custodial interrogation.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou.Photo:VCG</p>
<p><strong>Procedural flaws</p>
<p></strong>The border agency court testimony contradicts the actual way Meng was treated at the airport, according to the documents.</p>
<p>An agency official later said the phone passwords were provided &#8220;in error&#8221; and could not be used as evidence. The official alleged neither the border agency nor Mounted Police checked the device&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>However, according to the working notes of officials who enforced the law, the police sent phone identification information like serial numbers to the FBI.</p>
<p>In RCMP Sgt. Janice Vander Graaf&#8217;s work notes for December 12, RCMP constable Dhaliwal told her that Ben Chang, another RCMP constable, had provided seized phone serial numbers to the&nbsp;FBI, but said she had no independent knowledge or recollection of the information provided during her conversation with Dhaliwal.</p>
<p>The Canadian police&#8217;s denials that they shared phone information with the FBI have raised doubts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The documents show that Meng&#8217;s arrest at the airport constituted a gross abuse of process, during which the CBSA, RCMP, the Canadian Department of Justice and the FBI closely coordinated and cooperated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Particularly during the process, Canadian Department of Justice officials and other high-level officials had been timely briefed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canadian police witnessed the whole process of arrest and search by border agents in violation of Canadian court orders, the documents showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canadian law enforcement officials have an obligation to accurately document work notes, but the agency border inspectors, when recording notes, intentionally and &#8220;strategically missed the critical matters&#8221; without recording certain key sensitive facts, according to the documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the agency missed out the fact that the agency communicated with US authorities, that the agency and police met on December 1, and the arrest plan was changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agency also missed out the fact that the agents wrote down phone passwords on a separate note and asked Meng questions concerning criminal charges in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Political plot</p>
<p></strong>Meng&#8217;s extradition trial is scheduled to start in January, and her lawyers filed an application in November calling the Canadian government to immediately stop its attempt to extradite her, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US and Canada arbitrarily detained a Chinese citizen, seriously infringing on her legitimate rights, according to a statement published on the website of the Chinese Embassy&nbsp;in Canada on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Embassy urged again the Canadian side to&nbsp;correct its mistakes and release Meng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking into consideration new evidence on the law enforcement process, &#8220;the Canadian side should go ahead and release her,&#8221; Fang Xingdong, founder of Beijing-based technology think tank ChinaLabs, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;To act in line with the law will further prove it as a country valuing rule of law, not being contained by US political pressure,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts said judicial independence was seriously jeopardized by flaws in the law enforcement procedure, which also heavily weigh upon the reputation of Canada as a country with the rule of law.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to Canada to save its reputation, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meng&#8217;s arrest was not in line with the extradition law and also exposed procedural flaws by law enforcement,&#8221; Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University&#8217;s institute of international relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Canada continues politicizing the case, the legitimacy of its law and the independence of its judicial system will be further doubted,&#8221; said Li.</p>

<br />The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held a meeting Friday to analyze and study the economic work for 2020 and make plans for improving conduct and building integrity as well as fighting corruption.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Facing the complicated situation of rising risks and challenges both at home and abroad this year, China has maintained sustained and sound economic and social development, said the meeting.</p>
<p>Major steps have been taken in reform and opening-up with deepened supply-side structural reform, and breakthroughs have been made in scientific and technological innovation, the meeting noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The year 2020 will be the year to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and it is also the final year for the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/972044.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13th Five-Year Plan</a>. China shall achieve its first centenary goal,&#8221; said the meeting.</p>
<p>It called for taking Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as a guide and working hard to ensure the tasks are well completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The basic trend of steady long-term growth for China&#8217;s economy remains unchanged at present and for a period to come,&#8221; the meeting said, stressing transforming external pressure into motivation for deepening reform and furthering opening-up, and focusing on running China&#8217;s own affairs well.</p>
<p>Stressing the policy framework of keeping macroeconomic policies stable and microeconomic policies flexible, and ensuring social policies cover people&#8217;s basic needs and welfare of the disadvantaged, the meeting underscored preemptive, targeted and effective macroeconomic control and adoption of countercyclical adjustment tools.</p>
<p>The meeting emphasized further efforts in building a modern economic system, strengthening the high-quality development of agriculture, manufacturing and tertiary industries, and enhancing science and technology prowess and innovation capacity, as well as deepening reforms in the economic system to achieve a higher level of opening-up.</p>
<p>The meeting called for turning the institutional strength of the Party leading the economy work into more effective governance as underlined in the fourth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the CPC.</p>
<p>Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the National Supervisory Commission and their local organs have strengthened their supervisory duties, implemented the eight-point decision on improving Party and government conduct, taken action against the practice of formalities for formalities&#8217; sake and bureaucratism, and conducted political inspection and rectification, said the meeting.</p>
<p>It said efforts have been intensified to address corruption that occurs on people&#8217;s doorsteps, and to consolidate the sweeping victory in the fight against corruption.</p>
<p>Efforts have also been made to deepen reform of the disciplinary inspection and supervision system and build a contingent of anti-corruption officials who are loyal to the Party, have moral integrity and demonstrate a keen sense of responsibility, the meeting noted.</p>
<p>The fourth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee has made new requirements on promoting full and rigorous governance over the Party.</p>
<p>The meeting called for the disciplinary inspection and supervision work to strengthen checks on and oversight over the exercise of power, comprehensively promote the system under which officials &#8220;don&#8217;t dare to, are unable to and have no desire to commit acts of corruption,&#8221; and train a competent and professional disciplinary inspection team to safeguard the realization of the first centenary goal.</p>
<p>At an earlier meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Xi was briefed on the CCDI&#8217;s work in 2019 and preparations for the commission&#8217;s upcoming fourth plenary session, scheduled for Jan. 13 to 15, 2020.</p>

<p>China on Friday said it had taken &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; measures on US diplomats in the country. </p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a press conference that the Chinese side issued a note to the US Embassy in China on Wednesday, informing it of reciprocal measures going into immediate effect. </p>
<p>Hua made the remarks when asked to respond to reports that China had taken countermeasures in response to the previous restrictions imposed on Chinese diplomatic and consular officials posted in the United States. </p>
<p>In October, the United States ordered Chinese diplomats to notify the State Department in advance of any official meetings with US diplomats, local or municipal officials and before any visits to colleges or research institutions. </p>
<p>Asked to confirm reports that US diplomats in China are required to notify the Foreign Ministry five working says in advance of meetings with local officials, Hua said, the countermeasures &#8220;are reciprocal to the US State Department&#8217;s restrictive measures against Chinese diplomatic and consular officials.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;We once again urge the US side to correct its mistake, withdraw the decision and provide support and convenience for Chinese diplomatic and consular officials posted in the United States as they fulfill their official duties,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Hua said China has always supported diplomatic and consular personnel from other countries, including the United States, in carrying out normal official duties according to law. </p>
<p>&#8220;We will take appropriate measures in response to US actions,&#8221; she said.</p>

<br />China&#8217;s first documentary on its overall counter-terrorism efforts in<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> aired Thursday night prompted wide discussions among the audience with never-before-seen scenes of terrorism, which highlighted the hefty price China has paid and the country&#8217;s resolve to eradicate terrorism.</p>
<p>Video and audio clips in the English-language documentary were shown for the first time as evidence of the horrible crimes wrought by terrorists in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It also showed interactions between terrorists and overseas masterminds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nearly one hour-long documentary, &#8220;Fighting Terrorism in Xinjiang,&#8221; which was streamed on CGTN, China&#8217;s state broadcaster, has four parts. It begins with the evolution of extremism in Xinjiang, followed by the fight against terrorism. It also illustrated the interactions of terrorists and overseas forces accompanied by audio and video evidence. The documentary ends by highlighting international cooperation on counter-terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zheng Liang, a research fellow at Guangdong-based Jinan University, who studied Xinjiang for more than 10 years, told the Global Times that he felt &#8220;shocked&#8221; after viewing the documentary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zheng said that previous videos on Xinjiang&#8217;s counter-terrorism were not as specific and well-edited as the Thursday one. &#8220;This newly released documentary uses quite different visual language adopted by mainstream media.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The authorities did not publish the video and details of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang before out of concern they may cause panic. This proves China had paid a high price in fighting terrorism, and the international community should have a clear understanding of this,&#8221; Li Wei, a counter-terrorism expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Li noted that the video and audio footage justify China&#8217;s Xinjiang policies in countering terrorism, including launching the vocational education and training centers, which have been highly effective in de-radicalizing and fighting extremist forces.</p>
<p>The beginning of the documentary features the landscape of Xinjiang, its culture and the different ethnic groups in China, including the prosperous markets and people&#8217;s peaceful and happy lives. Then the scene shifts to depicting the threat of terrorism that wrought havoc in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Global threat</span></strong></p>
<p>Xinjiang has long been the main battlefield of countering terrorism. According to incomplete data, from 1990 to 2016, Xinjiang endured thousands of terrorist attacks that killed large numbers of innocent people and hundreds of police officers.</p>
<p>The documentary features video footage of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, including one in Yining, Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture in 1997, which left seven dead and 198 injured; the Urumqi riots on July 5, 2009, which caused 197 deaths and over 1,700 injuries; and the 2013 Seriqbuya attack in Kashi, which left 15 dead and two wounded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terrorists also orchestrated attacks in other cities of China: ramming a car into a crowd in Tiananmen Square in 2013, and another attack that struck the Kunming railway station on March 1, 2014, that left 31 dead and 141 wounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police officers in Xinjiang work on the frontline of the fight against terrorism. According to data from China Central Television, from 2013 to 2016, a total of 127 police officers in Xinjiang sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.</p>
<p>Experts believe terrorism is a global threat, and no country can win the war against terrorism on its own. In the face of the threat of terrorism and extremism, Xinjiang has taken a series of measures, including establishing laws and regulations, and launching effective counter-terrorism operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to media reports found by the Global Times, the Xinjiang region launched a special counter-terrorism campaign in May 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities have cracked down on 1,588 terrorist groups, and 12,995 terrorists and 2,052 explosive materials had been seized in Xinjiang since 2014, read a white paper on regional work on counter-terrorism, de-extremism and human rights protection in March.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Chinese national political advisors convened a bi-weekly seminar on Thursday to discuss addressing problems in developing compensation mechanisms for ecological conservation. </p>
<p>The seminar, held by the National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China&#8217;s top political advisory body, was presided over by Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. </p>
<p>Wang called for efforts to improve related policies and step up investments, and stressed both the government&#8217;s leading role and social participation in establishing a Chinese-style policy system for eco-compensation that fits the country&#8217;s conditions. </p>
<p>A total of 12 political advisors, experts and scholars put forward their suggestions, while over 160 political advisors voiced their opinions via a mobile platform. </p>
<p>They noted that since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, a lot of explorations have been carried out for eco-compensation mechanisms, and the policy framework has been established. </p>
<p>Some problems still need to be addressed, including the imperfect laws and regulations in the area and a lack of funding channels, according to the political advisors. </p>
<p>Political advisors proposed advancing legislation concerning eco-compensation mechanisms to better define the principles, areas, scope, subjects, standards and funding sources of the compensation and the rights and responsibilities of stakeholders. </p>
<p>They also proposed setting up more market-oriented and diversified eco-compensation mechanisms and strengthening trans-departmental information sharing and trans-regional coordination.</p>

<p>The so-called &#8220;Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019,&#8221; which was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday local time, has ignored facts, smeared and groundlessly criticized the human rights situation in China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Chinese government&#8217;s Xinjiang policies, according to a statement issued by the association.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese government institutions have voiced strong opposition on Wednesday against the US move of pushing forward the &#8220;Uyghur human rights policy act,&#8221; condemning the US of interfering in China&#8217;s domestic issues.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the US Uyghur human rights act that smears China&#8217;s counter-terrorism and anti-secession work in<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a>. &#8220;China will respond according to the situation,&#8221; said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Congress and the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference strongly opposed the act, and called on the US to stop damaging bilateral cooperation and mutual trust.</p>
<p>&#8220;We urge the US to stop interfering in China&#8217;s domestic affairs or it will reap the bitter fruits that it sowed itself,&#8221; said Chinese National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Some US politicians turn blind eye to the three forces&#8217; violent activities in Xinjiang and don&#8217;t care at all about the safety of Xinjiang residents. The act reveals their menacing intention to contain and split China, the commission said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s top counterterrorism official Liu Yuejin, the counter-terrorism commissioner of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/8.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Public Security</a>, also slammed the act as distorting the truth and using double standards and &#8220;human rights&#8221; excuses to grossly interfere in China&#8217;s internal affairs.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Xinjiang regional government, regional People&#8217;s Congress, regional committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference announced on Wednesday that they firmly oppose the US House move of passing the Uyghur bill, calling it an interference in China&#8217;s domestic affairs and severe infringement of international laws.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />Xinjiang is in the best situation in history where people of all ethnic groups stick together closely like pomegranate&nbsp;seeds. Xinjiang people have the final say on affairs concerning Xinjiang, they noted.</p>
<p>China will take strong countermeasures against the US, including releasing an &#8220;unreliable entity list&#8221; that includes relevant US entities, and imposing sanctions on relevant US officials, experts said, after the US House passed an act filled with groundless accusations against China&#8217;s Xinjiang Tuesday night, local time.</p>
<p>The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019 smeared China&#8217;s counter-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and used fabricated information to slander the vocational education and training centers and religious freedom in the region, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A look at the act shows it sticks to the old US rhetoric that uses double standards to distort China&#8217;s policies on Xinjiang, and it never mentioned the impressive social and economic development that Xinjiang has achieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lü Xiang, a research fellow on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times that this act doesn&#8217;t have any review process. The sources of the act are loose and unreliable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times that in addition to conveying the truth to the international community, China can adopt the unreliable entity list to list &#8220;those companies that dance to the act.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China will hit back with stronger countermeasures,&#8221; Wei Jianguo, a former Chinese vice minister of commerce and executive deputy director of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, told the Global Times. He hinted that the countermeasures could be even stronger than what China had taken after the US passed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wei said China can sanction certain US entities and personnel in the unreliable entity list and restrict their entry to and activities in China. &#8220;Chinese people are never afraid of a threat or the US. We will fight back with tough measures,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Erkin Oncan, a Turkish journalist who has followed Xinjiang issues for many years, slammed the act for its sinister intentions. &#8220;What China is trying to achieve, the US is trying hard to destroy,&#8221; Oncan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Origins of the act</p>
<p></strong>The act was initially submitted to the US Senate by notorious anti-China Senator Marco Rubio on January 17. Ironically, the act, which tarnished the counter-terrorism efforts in Xinjiang, was passed at the Senate on September 11, the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>According to the document that Global Times reporters saw on the US House website, the act is divided into nine chapters, and its core parts include findings, sense of congress and chapters requiring sanctions targeting China. It claimed the act aims to &#8220;direct United States resources to address human rights violations and abuses, including gross violations of human rights, by the People&#8217;s Republic of China&#8217;s mass surveillance and internment of over 1,000,000 Uighurs and other predominantly Turkic Muslim ethnic minorities in China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Compared with the previous version that got passed in the Senate, this amended act took out the &#8220;specific cases&#8221; and added an updated statement of US policy toward China. The act states that US policy toward China should be explicitly linked with the situation in Xinjiang. It also proposes sanctions on certain senior Chinese officials and restrictions on exports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the act was discussed in Congress, the US government had already issued a series of administrative orders against China on Xinjiang-related issues. On October 7, the US Department of Commerce announced that it would include 20 Chinese government agencies and eight companies in the list of entities which they claimed are related to the suppression of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The Chinese government agencies in the list of entities include the Public Security Department of Xinjiang and the Public Security Bureau of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. On October 8, the US State Department announced that it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese government officials.</p>
<p>Addressing the differences between the administrative order and act, Yuan Zheng, senior fellow of the Institute of American Studies at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the administrative order issued by the government can be cancelled anytime based on the real situation. But for the act, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to abolish it once it is signed by the president and becomes law. It needs adequate reasons and a whole process to abolish it, which is even harder than legislating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the act is passed, it means a new phase for the US in interfering in Xinjiang affairs begins, Yuan said. He pointed out that this interference will become &#8220;law-based&#8221; for the administrative departments and Congress. And it will also tarnish China&#8217;s international image, giving the US enormous influence.</p>
<p>Diao told the Global Times the US hastily pushed the act shortly after Trump singed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act because congressmen believe it would be easier to get the new act passed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the US House was quite busy in the first half of the year. If they don&#8217;t push it now, they may need to wait until April 2020. &#8220;So they want to fight a quick battle. Some congressmen also think the act is easy to get passed under the current situation of pressuring China,&#8221; Diao said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The act shows how US government grossly interfered into China&#8217;s internal affairs. It&#8217;s a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations. It is also a provocation against the Chinese people,&#8221; Wei said. He added that China is no longer the lamb to be slaughtered and won&#8217;t tolerate finger pointing by the US at its internal affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fabrication and double standards</strong></p>
<p>The amended act deleted specific cases in the findings. The Global Times checked these specific cases in the previous version with relevant agencies and found that they were fabricated. Some of them have been clarified in China&#8217;s white paper, titled The Fight Against Terrorism and Extremism and Human Rights Protection in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Diao noted that American politicians are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their attacks against China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cases they listed in the previous version were not credible and could spark criticism regarding its authenticity. Therefore, they didn&#8217;t bother to include these unreliable &#8220;cases&#8221; that could be attacked,&#8221; Diao said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pressuring China has become a bipartisan consensus. They don&#8217;t need many excuses to pass the act,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The act criticized medical facilities at the vocational education and training centers in Xinjiang. Global Times reporters who have visited the centers many times since 2018 saw that they are equipped with complete medical devices, with doctors who can provide free medical services to the trainees around the clock. Seriously ill trainees can be transferred to the local hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s noticeable that many of the &#8220;facts&#8221; listed in the act do not have an exact time, location or sources.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is self-circulation. I believe that the anti-China lawmakers did not spend any time to study what happened in Xinjiang. They made the so-called investigative findings based on some of the media&#8217;s unreliable reports and the so-called &#8216;testimonies&#8217; of the hearings. The legislators referred to Free Asia Radio and Voice of America to make some unwarranted reports. Then they used these media outlets again to say &#8216;further confirmation&#8217; [with their reports]. This is a game that the United States has played for many years,&#8221; Lü said.</p>
<p>Lü said that the US Congress does not care if the cases are true or not. &#8220;They are prejudiced. As long as this mistake does not affect the perception of Xinjiang in the West led by the United States, they won&#8217;t care,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from factual errors, the act is also full of double standards. It accused China of using advanced technology for surveillance across the region. But the adoption of modern technology and big data to improve social governance is common in the international community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the US is the last country that has the right to criticize China in tech security. US itself uses high technology to monitor people, and the US commits very serious crimes by doing it illegally,&#8221; Oncan told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s surveillance system is based on security, but the US version is based on the citizens&#8217; privacy. They [the US] watch secretly, categorize them and even sell them to companies which are working on matters like the elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that it&#8217;s absurd for the US to criticize China because China uses its surveillance system to prevent crime and make life easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China is not doing it secretly, unlike the US. The US uses the biggest data collection app in the world: Facebook!&#8221; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example of the double standards is that the US totally ignores the achievements Xinjiang has made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oncan said as a country with a base in Guantanamo Bay, the US represents doubles standards. &#8220;The US repeatedly uses the same arguments, which have already been explained by the Chinese government. And they purposely use a &#8216;human rights&#8217; discourse which has the wrong context. China secures the beliefs, language and culture by blocking radical Islam and terrorism.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to public data, from 2014 to 2018, Xinjiang lifted over 2.31 million people out of poverty and the incidence of rural poverty fell to 6.1 percent. More than 70 percent of the general public budget expenditures in the region are used to improve people&#8217;s livelihood, ensuring that all ethnic groups share the development achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The accusations against China reflect a &#8216;political tradition&#8217; of the US,&#8221; Lü said. According to him, the US has never stopped such practices ever since the normalization of ties between China and the US. Almost every 10 years, the US comes up with a new issue against China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Xinjiang issue is not new. It was brought up 10 years ago. But at that time, because the terrorist activities were so intense, they could not support it directly. But now when China has made great achievements in Xinjiang and no terrorist activities have happened in nearly three years, they bring up Xinjiang again,&#8221; Lü said.</p>
<p><strong>Countermeasures<br /></strong><br />
<br />While the act threatens to sanction certain Chinese senior officials and restrict exports of certain items, Diao told the Global Times that they cannot be realistically implemented, and any rational government will not implement it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the act will be like a sword hanging over China&#8217;s head. In the future, any US president can use it. In this sense, the act will have a very negative influence,&#8221; Diao said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diao suggested China should also impose sanctions on US politicians who pushed the act, and the NGOs behind it. &#8220;The US tactic is to place national law above international law. We should also think about coming up with our own agenda,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuan said China should give a timely response. He suggests a &#8220;precise strike&#8221; and that the strike should hit where it hurts the other side most without hurting ourselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lü suggested that if the act damages China, we can consider sanctioning the states represented by those legislators.&nbsp;</p>
