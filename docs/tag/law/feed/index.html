<p>China&#8217;s leading organ transplant scholar rebuked a report published in a peer-reviewed medical journal criticizing China&#8217;s organ donation data, saying the report is laden with logical and academic fallacies.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo, head of China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS), the country&#8217;s official organ distribution system, said that China will lodge a formal rebuttal to the journal BMC Medical Ethics questioning how such a paper came to be published.</p>
<p>During the Symposium on Development of Organ Donation and Transplantation in China in Kunming, capital of Southwest China&#8217;s Yunnan Province on Saturday, Wang referred to the medical journal report as a &#8220;serious accusation, and China felt the need of response.&#8221;</p>
<p>The paper published by Jacob Lavee, an Israeli scientist, Matthew Robertson and Raymond Hinde, Australian doctoral students, claimed China generated fake organ donation data using a simple mathematical equation.</p>
<p>The researchers claimed the quadratic equation produces an upward swing and that the data could be easily falsified.</p>
<p>In response, Wang showed slides drawn from data from the US, Brazil and Iran on the WHO website: All fit the binomial equation that gives an upward swing. Data from other countries also closely matches the equation, he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every countries&#8217; data can fit into an equation, because the equation is generated from the data,&#8221; Wang said. If the China&#8217;s organ donation data was generated by the equation, then any four-year number would fit the equation, Wang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But through cooperation with mathematicians of Peking University, Wang and his team found that any four-year number from China&#8217;s organ data generates different equations.</p>

<p>This powerfully disproves Lavee&#8217;s report, Wang declared.</p>
<p>Wang outlined how the organ donation data system works to more than 100 specialists from more than 30 countries including Germany, the Vatican, the US and Australia.</p>
<p>When a donor&#8217;s name is typed into the system, up comes his or her personal information, China national identify card number, consent details and other pertinent information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The allocation process of the system is real-time and supervised by institutes including transplant hospitals and the Red Cross, Wang said.</p>
<p>Huang Jiefu, head of the China National Organ Donation and Transplantation Committee and chairman of the China Organ Transplantation Development Foundation, said that he felt &#8220;sorry for Lavee&#8221; as the latter could have spent more time on organ transplantation to save people in his country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was invited by the Israeli Ambassador to China several times to introduce China&#8217;s experience on organ donation and transplantation reform, which I believe is the best rebuttal for Lavee,&#8221; Huang said.</p>
<p>Jose Núñez, in charge of the transplantation program at the World Health Organization, told the Global Times that they received the report produced by Lavee and it was sent to them repeatedly twice a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we didn&#8217;t respond,&#8221; said Núñez, noting that China has already provided efficient data to the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation.</p>
<p>Núñez said there was nothing that cast doubt on China&#8217;s data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;So anything that comes from the magazine or the scientific journal is just his or her opinion,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Chinese experience hailed</span></strong></p>
<p>Huang the foundation chairman said that the malicious attacks proved China&#8217;s organ donation and transplantation work was achieving great success worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise, no one would bother to attack it,&#8221; Huang said.</p>
<p>The official Chinese data documents 2,766 organ donations in 2015, 4,080 in 2016, 5,146 in 2017 and 6,302 in 2018. The number of organ donations in 2018 ranked second in the world.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of a green channel for organ transport three years ago, the transfer time for organs has been shortened by an average of 1 to 1.5 hours and the overall organ sharing rate&nbsp;&nbsp; has increased by 7.3 percent, the Chinese mainland data showed.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Song Liuping, chief legal officer of Huawei, speaks at a press conference at the company&#8217;s headquarters in Shenzhen, China, on Thursday. Huawei has filed a lawsuit challenging a recent US Federal Communications Commission. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Amid legal disputes and an escalated crackdown by Washington, Huawei has not stopped moving forward to defend its rights, a rational and legitimate way to win the battle against the US as well as the hearts of&nbsp;the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei announced it is suing the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday, asking to overturn the latest restrictions limiting the Chinese firm&#8217;s market access to rural America. It was Huawei&#8217;s second legal challenge against the US in a year, though the company has been used by Washington as a leverage amid the US-China trade war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its latest legal move, Huawei filed a petition with the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, seeking to reverse an FCC order passed on November 2 which bans carriers from purchasing Huawei equipment through a federal subsidy plan, citing national security concerns, the Chinese company announced at a press conference in Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangzhou Province on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has become the world&#8217;s largest telecoms equipment vendor, holding over 25 percent of market share. It has also been a leading force in 5G network roll-outs, as it was ranked first in technology contributions to 5G standards.</p>
<p>The FCC&#8217;s latest decision labeling Huawei a national security threat, forbidding small, mostly rural carriers, from purchasing its equipment through Universal Service Fund subsidies, has come as part of broader efforts by current US administration to suppress Huawei.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banning Huawei from building 5G networks would delay the roll-out of the next generation of wireless technologies in the US by six to 18 months, which would lead to $240 billion in the country&#8217;s GDP losses, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Growing controversies</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some analysts see Huawei&#8217;s lawsuit as finally &#8220;showing its claws&#8221; after the Chinese telecoms giant has been repeatedly placed under scrutiny and sanctions by the US government, at a time when China-US relations are imperiled by a protracted trade war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington has been escalating its crackdown against Huawei. For example, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been urging European countries to reject Huawei and ZTE on excuse of security risks, while the some in the Trump administration has even considered the &#8220;nuclear&#8221; option to ban the firm from the US banking system, media reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The logo of China&#8217;s tech giant Huawei. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Furthermore, some Western media claimed that the Chinese firm, as a rallying point for patriotism amid the trade war, began losing the sympathy of the Chinese public as it has been facing a backlash in the country over the 251-day detention of one of its former employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, the lack of detailed evidence in the case of Li Hongyuan, the company&#8217;s former employee jailed allegedly for extortion, made it bewildering, but it did not subdue public&#8217;s support for Huawei in suing the US federal institution. &#8220;Huawei sues FCC&#8221; is among the top 10 most searched topic on Chinese Twitter-like Weibo on Thursday, viewed 140 million times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people support Li&#8217;s lawsuit against Huawei, now Huawei has set an example,&#8221; a Weibo user said. As Li harshly criticized Huawei&#8217;s alleged wrongdoings, the Chinese company replied that it supports Li&#8217;s handling of the dispute through legal measures, which was considered by some as a cold PR response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too early to draw any conclusion, as more details about the case are expected to be disclosed,&#8221; Fang Xingdong, founder of Beijing-based technology think tank ChinaLabs, told the Global Times. &#8220;The image of Huawei in Chinese people&#8217;s hearts has not changed,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Taking the initiative</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei challenged the constitutionality of the US government&#8217;s decision in March, as the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) not only restricts the Chinese firm from serving US customers, but also deprives it of opportunities to serve customers outside the US. The company once said it is compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nine months later, the firm challenged a US court&#8217;s decision, which would also test the spirit of the rule of law in the US, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a legal attack and defense strategy. If Huawei only endures attacks but never fights back, it will lose its initiative. Even if Huawei loses its case, it will put pressure on the US,&#8221; Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the rule of law in the US, the end does not justify such unlawful means of the FCC, Glen Nager, Huawei&#8217;s lead counsel for the legal action, told reporters. &#8220;We are confident that the Fifth Circuit Court will vacate the commission&#8217;s order.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of so-called national security risks, the Chinese foreign ministry also raised questions about the standards and who defines them. &#8220;China can suspect that the US may issue an order to shut off a Boeing engine at will if we follow US logic,&#8221; Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the ministry, told a routine conference on Thursday, in response to US side&#8217;s statements on the participation of Huawei and ZTE in 5G.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCC said it declined to comment on the case when it was contacted by the Global Times on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While facing growing pressure from the US, Huawei senior executives are still committed to openness and collaboration, although uncertainties remain whether the Trump administration would impose tougher restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We insist on an open attitude to embrace globalization. If the law allows it, we&#8217;ll keep collaborating with US partners,&#8221; Song Liuping, Huawei&#8217;s chief legal officer, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is out on bail and remains under partial house arrest after she was detained last year at the behest of American authorities, leaves her home to attend a court hearing in Vancouver, on September 23. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Calls were still loud Sunday on Chinese social media for the release of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou one year after her arrest in Vancouver&nbsp;airport at the request of the US.</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s case has evolved to be a linchpin in a stalemate between China and Canada, Chinese observers say, noting that breakthroughs made by the Chinese telecommunications giant over the past year prove that the US attempt to contain Huawei&#8217;s achievements and China&#8217;s technological rise has and will continue to come to naught.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Cong Peiwu, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Canada, also paid a visit to Meng in Vancouver.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government is determined to protect the just and legitimate rights and interests of its citizens and enterprises, and will continue to urge the Canadian side to correct its mistake and take measures to solve the issue as soon as possible,&#8221; Cong said, as quoted in a statement posted Friday on the website of the Embassy in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great motherland and nearly 1.4 billion Chinese people are your staunchest supporters. We expect you to go back to China safe and sound at an early date,&#8221; the statement said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition proceedings for Meng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei&#8217;s daughter, are scheduled for January, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has yet to respond to&nbsp;the Global Times&#8217; request for disclosure on the progress of the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detention of Meng has deeply hurt China-Canada relations, and both Canada and the US have staked their international reputations on the case, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US request for Meng&#8217;s extradition from Canada is destined to end in failure, he believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition request was based on insufficient evidence, which means it would be impossible for the request to be justified in the Canadian legal system, Yang asserted.</p>
<p>A thorough and complicated procedure must be gone through before any extradition request is validated, he explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case will most likely either become &#8220;a protracted juridical war that may last 10 years or even longer,&#8221; or result in a solution that all the three sides involved can agree on, he added, stressing that the solution won&#8217;t be what the US wants.</p>
<p>Huawei has also become a bone of contention in the China-US trade tensions, during which the US has launched multiple offensives against Huawei.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A temporary experience store of Huawei in Shanghai on Saturday Photo: VCG</p>
<p>In the words of Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, China has not given in at the trade talks with the US and Huawei has not collapsed amid the US-initiated blockage.</p>
<p>In a fresh move, the US Federal Communications Commission announced a decision on November 22 barring the use of an $8.5 billion government fund to buy equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE on national security grounds.</p>
<p>Huawei said it would make an announcement at an event in its Shenzhen headquarters on Thursday about filing suit to challenge the FCC&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen-based technology giant has reportedly secured over 50 commercial 5G contracts across the globe, with 28 from Europe, 11 from the Middle East, six from the Asia-Pacific, four from the Americas, and one from Africa, the company revealed in&nbsp;September.</p>
<p>Huawei said it had delivered over 200,000 5G base stations and built nearly two-thirds of all 5G base stations shipped globally.</p>
<p>The US blockage has prompted Huawei to shift toward Japan for imports of chips and other core components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has pioneered the nation&#8217;s push for indigenous technological prowess, Xiang told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering Huawei&#8217;s flagship 5G system on a chip (SoC) as an example of the company&#8217;s edge over its global rivals in terms of core technology, Xiang reckoned the company has largely weathered the US attempt to contain Chinese tech products and solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest data from Berlin-based market intelligence platform IPlytics showed, as of November, Huawei&#8217;s declared 5G patents total 3,325, topping the global 5G declaration rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies following Huawei include Samsung with 2,846, LG with 2,463, Nokia with 2,308 and ZTE with 2,204.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highest-rated US company is Qualcomm at seventh 7th with 1,330 declared 5G patents.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Chinese pattern&#8221; of treatment has helped reduce the mortality rate among Chinese AIDS patients in recent years and proved one of the world&#8217;s most effective and cheapest methods in combating this deadly disease, Chinese experts said after the latest official report indicated the epidemic was still at a low prevalence level in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A total 958,000 AIDS-infected patients in China were reported by the end of October this year, according to statistics from the bureau of disease control and prevention at China&#8217;s National Health Commission (NHC).</p>
<p>From January to October this year, 230 million people were tested nationwide of which 131,000 were newly found infected, said the NHC ahead of Sunday,&nbsp;the 32nd annual World AIDS Day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The commission said that 86.6 percent of infected patients eligible for treatment received antiviral treatment, with a 93.5 percent rate of success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has made significant progress in AIDS prevention and control, especially in recent years, said Gao Fu, head of the country&#8217;s disease control and prevention center.</p>
<p>HIV infection via blood transmission has been almost eliminated, while infections among drug users through injection and mother-to-child transmission have been effectively curtailed. Sexual transmission has become the main route of transmission, experts say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&nbsp;has been promoting HIV testing&nbsp;and scaling up, and has made notable achievements in strengthening&nbsp;HIV&nbsp;counseling and&nbsp;testing, said Wu Zunyou, head of the AIDS and HIV prevention and control center of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HIV diagnostic rate in China has soared from 21 percent in 2005 to 69 percent in 2018, and the inhibition ratio of the virus has reached 94 percent in 2018 compared with 85 percent in 2011, an employee from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention was quoted by China News Service as saying on Sunday.</p>
<p>New technology has also played an important role in bolstering the detection rate of HIV in China.</p>
<p>Newly developed test kits, which only require saliva and urine, have spared many the embarrassment of running to public institutes for a test,&nbsp;said experts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October, a research center in Xiamen University, along with Beijing Wantai BioPharm, a bio-pharmaceutical company, worked out a urine test kit which enables one to take an HIV test by collecting urine, and the result is out in 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese government has also stepped up efforts ensuring treatment, relief and medical security for AIDS patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September, 10 government departments including the NHC introduced a three-year plan from 2019 to 2022 to curb the spread of AIDS.</p>
<p>The plan required AIDS treatment be included in a hospital&#8217;s performance evaluation and encouraged hospitals to utilize the internet and other new technologies to provide long-distance consultation and treatment of the disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Premier Li Keqiang clarified in the instruction that all levels of government and departments should carry out their responsibilities to increase investment, make effective and down-to-earth efforts in ensuring treatment, relief and medical security for patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said that more key problems in science and technology, such as drug development, should be tackled, while more humanistic care should be delivered to patients to keep improving their quality of life, according to an article published on China&#8217;s State Council website on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is including more AIDS medicine in its medical insurance system, which has helped relieve the burden for some patients, Wang Ruotao, a former research fellow at the National Center for&nbsp;AIDS&nbsp;Control and Prevention, told the Global Times.</p>

<strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">More challenges ahead</span></strong></p>
<p>The NHC report found that the number of teenagers and elderly people infected with HIV was on the rise among reported HIV infection cases during January to October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People aged 60 or older and infected with HIV has surged in recent years from 9.7 percent in 2011 to 16.46 percent in 2018, said Wu, noting the boom even outstripped the increase in the elderly population in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many elderly people lack safe sex awareness, believing that they need no protection as they already lost their fertility, said Chinese experts, noting that the elderly also don&#8217;t have sufficient knowledge of AIDS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile young people, despite available information about AIDS, easily forget risks in real life, said Wang. He pointed to emerging social media and dating apps.&nbsp;<br />
<br /> <br />
<center><br />
 &nbsp;<br />
</center>Among cases of sexual transmission, men having sex with men (MSM) accounted for 23.3 percent of the newly infected AIDS patients in China from January to October this year.</p>
<p>It is estimated that one quarter of all people infected with HIV in China did not take a&nbsp; test, or are not aware of the infection.</p>
<p>The public&#8217;s awareness of AIDS urgently needed to be improved, Zhou Yuhui, an official from NHC&#8217;s disease control and prevention center was quoted by media as saying.</p>
<p>Peng Liyuan, wife of&nbsp;Chinese President Xi Jinping and a goodwill ambassador of the World Health Organization for tuberculosis and&nbsp;HIV/AIDS, attended an activity related World AIDS Day at Communication University of China in Beijing on Thursday.</p>
<p>During the activity, she visited AIDS prevention volunteer services and encouraged attendants to contribute their ideas to keep AIDS out of campus.</p>
<p>To raise people&#8217;s awareness of AIDS prevention and treatment, Tencent and the Chinese Association of STD and AIDS Prevention and Control, introduced an online game on Sunday which focuses on the lives of three AIDS patients and follows their treatment.</p>

<p>Foreign-related intellectual property cases have been increasing in China, with many involving the US, accounting for 33.2 percent, a senior judge said on Sunday.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2019, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court processed 13,736 foreign cases, accounting for 21.1 percent of its total cases since it was founded in November 2014, Chen Jinchuan, vice chief of the court, said on Sunday at the China Forum for International Legal Cooperation in Guangzhou, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, thepaper.cn reported on Monday.</p>
<p>A total of 10,755 cases involving foreign affairs have been closed. The cases do not include those involving Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan.</p>
<p>About 95.8 percent of the foreign-related intellectual property cases are administrative cases, among which 91.8 percent are on trademarks, the report said. Meanwhile, 572 are civil cases, involving trademarks, copyright and unfair competition.</p>
<p>Cases concerning Fortune 500 companies are up to 1,122, accounting for 10.4 percent of the total cases. The automobiles and parts industries have the most cases, followed by computing, office supplies and petroleum refining.</p>
<p>The cases involved 90 countries and regions, with 33.2 percent of them involving the US, 10.3 percent of involving Germany and 8.8 percent involving Japan.</p>
<p>According to Chen, interested parties in the civil cases asked for an average compensation of 2.77 million yuan.</p>
<p>The court was set up in 2014 as China&#8217;s first intellectual property court. Many foreign companies and multinationals have chosen to file lawsuits in the court to safeguard their intellectual property rights (IPR). China has stepped up the protection of IPR in a bid to improve the business environment and encourage innovation, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>

<p>A criminal gang was nabbed by the police in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province for running&nbsp; a gambling app for visually-impaired people.</p>
<p>The app, &#8220;Xiangni Entertainment,&#8221; made 9 million yuan ($1.3 million) in eight months, according to the Binjiang district public security bureau in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, The Beijing News reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The police said they detained suspects connected to the app and seized the devices they used. The police are undergoing further investigation.</p>
<p>According to the police, the app provided gambling games for visually-impaired people.</p>
<p>The app was not open to the public. New users had to be invited to register, the Zhejiang Legal Newspaper reported on Friday.</p>
<p>More than 5,000 people were involved in the app&#8217;s gambling games.</p>
<p>A victim said the app was &#8220;deeply trusted by blind community&#8221; because they could use it without handicaps. The app proved devastating for users. Some lost as much as 300,000 yuan in one month, The Beijing News reported.</p>
<p>Binjiang police said that several suspects of the criminal group were also disabled.</p>
<p>China has a visually-impaired population of more than 17 million, according to china.com.cn in January. Many of them make a living as factory workers or masseuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hangzhou police cracked down on the group during a campaign to combat illicit activity on the internet environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost 2,400 suspects have been detained in 1,200 cases involving internet crimes this year. The cases covered online hacking, gambling, pornography and the gun trade, according to the report of the Zhejiang Legal Newspaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fourth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) will be held from October 28 to 31 in Beijing, according to a decision made at a CPC Central Committee Political Bureau meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting on Thursday, the Xinhua News Agency reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau discussed important issues concerning how to uphold and improve the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernize China&#8217;s system and capacity for governance, according to a statement issued after the meeting.</p>
<p>They were briefed about the opinions solicited from in and outside the CPC about a document on the CPC Central Committee&#8217;s decision concerning how to uphold and improve the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernize China&#8217;s system and capacity for governance.</p>
<p>They decided that the document will be revised based on the discussion at Thursday&#8217;s meeting and submitted to the fourth plenary session.</p>
<p>Zhang Xixian, a professor at the Party School of the Central Committee of the CPC, told the Global Times that the plenary session scheduled at the end of this month would have milestone significance.</p>
<p>The plenary session will be held in a same month of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, so it could be a historic political event that would summarize how the current system of socialism with Chinese characteristics has been established in the past 70 years, and also laid the foundation for the further improvement of this political system, Zhang noted.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Step by step</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee in October 2017 confirmed the members of the leading group of the Party Central; the second plenary session in January 2018 passed the proposal for a constitutional amendment. The third plenary session in February 2018 reviewed and adopted a decision by the CPC Central Committee to deepen reform in the Party and state institutions as well as a plan for the reform, Xinhua reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The communiqué from the third plenary session said, &#8220;Faced with new requirements for various tasks in the new era, the current function and structure of Party and state institutions are not completely suitable for implementing the five-sphere integrated plan and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy, nor for modernizing China&#8217;s system and capacity for governance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Su Wei, a professor at the Party School of the Communist Party of China Chongqing Municipal Committee, said that since the 19th National Congress of the CPC, Xi, as the core leader of the CPC Central Committee, has paid great attention to strengthening the Party&#8217;s leadership in various sectors, and the reform of state institutions has also improved efficiency and reduced overlapping functions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a condition to further push the modernization of China&#8217;s system and capacity for governance,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese experts also noted that the upcoming plenary session&#8217;s theme also showed its connection to the goals set by the third and fourth plenary sessions of the 18th CPC Central Committee, which are to deepen the reform comprehensively, and comprehensively advance the law-based governance of China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law-based governance and deepening the reform comprehensively both serve the goal of modernizing China&#8217;s system and capacity for governance,&#8221; Su said.</p>
<p>The report of the 19th CPC National Congress said &#8220;Law-based governance is an essential requirement and important guarantee for socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must exercise Party leadership at every point in the process and over every dimension of law-based governance, and be fully committed to promoting socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Unbreakable connection</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPC Central Committee Political Bureau said in the meeting Thursday that &#8220;upholding and improving the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics&#8221; together with &#8220;the modernization of China&#8217;s system and capacity for governance&#8221; are significant strategic missions of the Party, and should be led by the CPC Central Committee. Party committees and governments at all levels, as well as leading officials should strengthen their consciousness to safeguard and uphold the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, to guide the Party and society to respect the system, strictly execute the system and firmly safeguard the system, the political bureau stressed.</p>
<p>Su said some people have ignored the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics while merely mentioning the modernization of China&#8217;s system and capacity for governance. This way they would misguide the people to apply Westernization to the modernization of China&#8217;s system and capacity for governance. But this is wrong, he said.</p>
<p>The points stressed by the political bureau proved that there is an unbreakable connection between the two missions, Su said. &#8220;A political system must first be established before the reform and modernization is pushed forward,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Is standing in the corner or being forced to run a lap counted as a corporal punishment in schools? South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province may entitle their teachers to punish ill-behaved students by having them stand or run, which will not be deemed as physical punishment.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Guangdong Provincial School Safety Regulations,&#8221; which was submitted to the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People&#8217;s Congress on Tuesday, intends to allow teachers to implement &#8220;standing&#8221; and &#8220;running&#8221; as punishments for students when necessary, and clearly distinguishes such punishments from actual or disguised corporal punishment.</p>
<p>If the regulations are approved by the government, Guangdong will be the first province in the country to enact legislation to bestow teachers with clear and legal punishment power, according to media reports.</p>
<p>The draft sparked controversy among Chinese internet users. Netizens who support such legislation believe that the regulations help students learn right from wrong, and help teachers create a positive learning environment.</p>
<p>Others, however, think that &#8220;standing&#8221; and &#8220;running&#8221; are indeed corporal punishments, which will have a negative influence on the development of students&#8217; physical and mental health, and it is difficult to define and specify the limits of &#8220;punishment power&#8221; legally.</p>
<p>The draft released on the website of the Standing Committee of Guangdong Provincial People&#8217;s Congress stipulates that students in elementary and secondary schools who throw hard objects at others, push and shove others, make disruptive noises or commit plagiarism should be criticized and can be punished with educational measures such as standing and running (at a slow pace). These punishments should be compatible with their age, and physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Teachers must not exercise corporal punishment, disguised corporal punishment or other acts that impact students&#8217; dignity, says the draft.</p>
<p>The draft explains the necessity of entitling teachers to punishment power, including that many teachers are afraid of dealing with school violations caused by students due to the ambiguity of corporal punishment. The draft suggests that the government should incorporate campus safety into social governance to improve security risk prevention and control systems.</p>
<p>A staff member from the Department of Education of Guangdong Province told the Global Times on Thursday that the draft is still under review by relevant authorities, but did not provide the date that it will be finalized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Justice of Guangdong previously released a regulation draft on school safety on April 12, stipulating that schools and teachers can criticize and punish students when they do not listen to their teachers carefully, do not do their homework on time or violate class discipline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Cheap generic drugs from India are attracting lower income Chinese patients. Photo: IC</p>
<p>Legal foreign drugs, including generic drugs from India, will not be treated as fake medicines in China based on a revised drug administration law that will take effect on December 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s top legislature, the Standing Committee of National People&#8217;s Congress, passed the revised drug law on Monday to enhance management and supervision of the drug market following numerous fake drug and vaccine cases that had triggered a call for stronger measures to ensure drug safety.</p>
<p>The latest revision removes drugs that are legal in foreign countries but not approved in China from the category of fake medicines. It also states that people who take these drugs without an official approval into China can be granted leniency if the amount of the drug is small. They will be exempt from punishment if the drug does not cause health problems or delays anyone&#8217;s treatment, thepaper.cn reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some experts take the move as a sign that China is opening its market to cheap generic medicines, especially from India, which caused national concern in 2018 following the release of the Chinese black comedy,<br />
<em>Dying to Survive</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revised clause addresses patients&#8217; needs, Liu Changqiu, a health law expert and research fellow at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different countries may apply different standards to drugs, but patients should be allowed the right to buy legal foreign drugs as long as they are effective, Liu said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Liu said that the revision does not mean that China is ready to relax management on imported generic medicine. People who want to import generic drugs for profit still have to follow Chinese laws to register and get an approval in advance.</p>
<p>Most generic medicines which applied for registration in China from 2016 to 2018 were reportedly produced in India and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Experts warned legal risks still exist for distributors who buy drugs abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the revised law, China is also mulling a tracking platform for drugs to prevent fake and substandard medicines from getting through legal channels, according to Liu Pei, director of the policies and regulations department of the National Medical Products Administration, thepaper.cn reported Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revised law provides the strictest standards and toughest measures over the industry chain, including research and development, manufacturing, sales, use and management of drugs, the Xinhua News Agency reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It increased the penalty for fake medicine producers from 2-5 times of the production value to 15-30 times, which means the lowest fine will be about 1.5 million yuan ($210,000), the deputy director of the National People&#8217;s Congress&#8217; state law office of the legislative affairs commission told China Central Television on Monday.<br />
