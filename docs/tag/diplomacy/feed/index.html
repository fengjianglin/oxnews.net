<br /> Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin inaugurated the China-Russia east route natural gas pipeline by video link-up on Monday sending a signal that energy and cooperation in other sectors between the two countries are becoming the key to boosting multilateralism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entering service the same day, the pipeline will help Russia export up to 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to China, according to an article posted on the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) website on Monday.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s almost one-third of China&#8217;s total natural gas imports in 2018. About 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia will be delivered to China in 2020 and will be gradually increased to 38 billion cubic meters per year, the article said.</p>
<p>CNPC is responsible for the construction and management of the project within China: Stretching from Russia&#8217;s Siberia to China&#8217;s Yangtze River Delta, the pipeline covers 8,000 kilometers, of which 5,111 kilometers fall within Chinese borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project extends from Heihe in Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province to North China&#8217;s Hebei Province and finally to Shanghai in East China across a total of nine provinces and municipalities.</p>
<p>Russia will deliver a total 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas to China over the 30 years of contract, media reports said.</p>
<p>Following 20 years of negotiations, China and Russia reached the more than $400 billion contract in May 2014, the CNPC article read.</p>
<p>A China-Russia west route and China-Far East pipelines are also under discussion, the article said.</p>

<p>
<strong>Win-win deal</p>
<p></strong>Mutual benefit drove the two countries&#8217; energy development strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A &#8220;rapidly rising China needs a stable and reliable energy supply, while an increasingly powerful Russia also needs to participate in the world&#8217;s largest market,&#8221; the CNPC article said.</p>
<p>The pipeline will help stabilize China&#8217;s natural gas supply and guarantee the country&#8217;s energy security, especially if the situation ever changes for ocean transportation of natural gas in certain waters like the South China Sea, Jin Lei, an associate professor at the Beijing-based China University of Petroleum, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>The construction of the pipeline fits the country&#8217;s strategic energy blueprint, Jin noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline system in northwestern China, a China-Myanmar oil and gas pipeline in the southwestern region and about 20 liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the eastern region,&#8221; Jin said.</p>
<p>The construction of the China-Russia pipeline will make up for the lack of a cross-border natural gas pipeline in northeastern China, he said, noting that the China-Russia pipe is a strategic energy supply channel.</p>
<p>China is the world&#8217;s largest natural gas importer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, China imported 90.39 million tons (about 125.9 billion cubic meters) of natural gas, data from the General Administration of Customs shows.</p>
<p>The annual import of 38 billion cubic meters from Russia would account for nearly one-third of China&#8217;s annual total natural gas imports, and Russia is expected to be China&#8217;s largest supplier.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chinese demand, the pipeline will become an important channel for Russian exports, Jin said, especially if problems impede Russia&#8217;s natural gas export to Western Europe.</p>
<p>Europe is a big export market for Russian gas, with Gazprom alone exporting about 202 billion cubic meters to European countries and Turkey in 2018, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But those exports can suffer during political tensions.</p>
<p>The US and European countries oppose construction of Nord Stream 2, a Russian gas pipeline to Western Europe, over security concerns, The Los Angeles Times reported in June.</p>
<p>As a major resources export economy, Russia saw its natural gas production hit a record 725 billion cubic meters in 2018, of which 225 billion cubic meters were exported, Xinhua reported in January, citing Russian energy minister Alexander Novak.</p>
<p>The project deepens China-Russia relations, Chinese observers noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US has become a net exporter of oil for the first time in decades, noted Wang Yiwei, a director of China&#8217;s Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.</p>
<p>China-Russia energy and financial cooperation boosts multilateralism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia is not only a business partner, but more of a strategic partner in politics and diplomacy,&#8221; he told the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of the pipeline project will step up China-Russia cooperation in other aspects including regional cooperation and cyber-security, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the international backdrop that the US continues to contain China by even sacrificing its own interests, China supporting Russia is supporting itself,&#8221; Wang said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is out on bail and remains under partial house arrest after she was detained last year at the behest of American authorities, leaves her home to attend a court hearing in Vancouver, on September 23. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Calls were still loud Sunday on Chinese social media for the release of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou one year after her arrest in Vancouver&nbsp;airport at the request of the US.</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s case has evolved to be a linchpin in a stalemate between China and Canada, Chinese observers say, noting that breakthroughs made by the Chinese telecommunications giant over the past year prove that the US attempt to contain Huawei&#8217;s achievements and China&#8217;s technological rise has and will continue to come to naught.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Cong Peiwu, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Canada, also paid a visit to Meng in Vancouver.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government is determined to protect the just and legitimate rights and interests of its citizens and enterprises, and will continue to urge the Canadian side to correct its mistake and take measures to solve the issue as soon as possible,&#8221; Cong said, as quoted in a statement posted Friday on the website of the Embassy in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great motherland and nearly 1.4 billion Chinese people are your staunchest supporters. We expect you to go back to China safe and sound at an early date,&#8221; the statement said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition proceedings for Meng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei&#8217;s daughter, are scheduled for January, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has yet to respond to&nbsp;the Global Times&#8217; request for disclosure on the progress of the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detention of Meng has deeply hurt China-Canada relations, and both Canada and the US have staked their international reputations on the case, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US request for Meng&#8217;s extradition from Canada is destined to end in failure, he believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition request was based on insufficient evidence, which means it would be impossible for the request to be justified in the Canadian legal system, Yang asserted.</p>
<p>A thorough and complicated procedure must be gone through before any extradition request is validated, he explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case will most likely either become &#8220;a protracted juridical war that may last 10 years or even longer,&#8221; or result in a solution that all the three sides involved can agree on, he added, stressing that the solution won&#8217;t be what the US wants.</p>
<p>Huawei has also become a bone of contention in the China-US trade tensions, during which the US has launched multiple offensives against Huawei.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A temporary experience store of Huawei in Shanghai on Saturday Photo: VCG</p>
<p>In the words of Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, China has not given in at the trade talks with the US and Huawei has not collapsed amid the US-initiated blockage.</p>
<p>In a fresh move, the US Federal Communications Commission announced a decision on November 22 barring the use of an $8.5 billion government fund to buy equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE on national security grounds.</p>
<p>Huawei said it would make an announcement at an event in its Shenzhen headquarters on Thursday about filing suit to challenge the FCC&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen-based technology giant has reportedly secured over 50 commercial 5G contracts across the globe, with 28 from Europe, 11 from the Middle East, six from the Asia-Pacific, four from the Americas, and one from Africa, the company revealed in&nbsp;September.</p>
<p>Huawei said it had delivered over 200,000 5G base stations and built nearly two-thirds of all 5G base stations shipped globally.</p>
<p>The US blockage has prompted Huawei to shift toward Japan for imports of chips and other core components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has pioneered the nation&#8217;s push for indigenous technological prowess, Xiang told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering Huawei&#8217;s flagship 5G system on a chip (SoC) as an example of the company&#8217;s edge over its global rivals in terms of core technology, Xiang reckoned the company has largely weathered the US attempt to contain Chinese tech products and solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest data from Berlin-based market intelligence platform IPlytics showed, as of November, Huawei&#8217;s declared 5G patents total 3,325, topping the global 5G declaration rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies following Huawei include Samsung with 2,846, LG with 2,463, Nokia with 2,308 and ZTE with 2,204.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highest-rated US company is Qualcomm at seventh 7th with 1,330 declared 5G patents.</p>

<p>Egyptian and Chinese teams announced Sunday the start of the implementation phase of the China-funded &#8220;MisrSat II&#8221; satellite project.</p>
<p>During the kick-off meeting, which was held at the Egyptian Space City near Egypt&#8217;s new administrative capital, both sides signed the documents of launching the project that is funded by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a ceremony to launch the satellite project was held during the fourth<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1065050.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China-Arab States Expo</a>, being held in Yinchuan, capital of northwest China&#8217;s Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>Egypt and China signed in January an agreement on a 72-million-US dollar Chinese grant for Egypt&#8217;s MisrSat II satellite, which is a small high-resolution remote sensing satellite.</p>
<p>Egypt sees the project as another major cooperation between the two countries in the field of space after signing an agreement to build the Egyptian Satellite Assembly, Integration and Test Center which is expected to be fully established this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the kick-off meeting for starting the project of MisrSat II satellite which will be implemented thanks to a grant from China,&#8221; Ahmed al-Rafie, head of the MisrSat II Satellite project, told Xinhua, adding &#8220;the satellite will help Egypt with its development plans in many fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>The official said the satellite will be developed through cooperative and joint work between Chinese and Egyptian teams who work in parallel, noting that there will be Chinese guidance throughout the project phases.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will provide the Egyptian side with experience in the development of satellite space systems,&#8221; he said, adding that it will take the teams about 35 months to finish the building of the satellite.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design phases will be carried out in parallel in Egypt and China, but the assembly and integration of the satellite will be done in Egypt at Egyptian Satellite Assembly, Integration and Test Center,&#8221; said the official.</p>
<p>In addition to the satellite, a ground control station and a ground application system to support the operation of the satellite will be also supplied, al-Rafie said.</p>
<p>He revealed that the lifetime of the satellite is five years, while the lifetime of the ground station is 15 years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Liao Liqiang said he believes that China and Egypt have made &#8220;four firsts&#8221; in this project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first is that Egypt is the first country to carry out satellite cooperation with China under the framework of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second is that China will help Egypt build a complete satellite assembly integration and test center, in which scientists and engineers from China and Egypt will jointly complete the assembly, integration and test of Egypt&#8217;s MisrSat II,&#8221; said the ambassador.</p>
<p>The third, Liao said, is that China will help Egypt build its aerospace team and will jointly train Egyptian aerospace experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fourth is that after the project is completed, Egypt will be the first African country to have complete satellite assembly integration testing capabilities,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Liao noted China is willing to work with Egypt to build Egypt&#8217;s own aerospace science and technology talents for the independent development of Egypt&#8217;s space field.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also willing to make our contributions to the economic and social development of Egypt, including the fields of agriculture, environmental protection, and anti-desertification,&#8221; the ambassador said.</p>
