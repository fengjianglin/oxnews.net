<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. This amounts to typical US interference in China&#8217;s Hong Kong affairs.</p>
<p>Being part of China, Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the country&#8217;s governance. Washington has no jurisdiction over Hong Kong, but the legislation tries to legitimize its right to affect Beijing&#8217;s policies on the city, which is a clear violation of Chinese sovereignty. Imagine if China takes action to interfere in the US presidential elections or adopts a policy regulating how Canberra should treat its ethnic minority groups, will there be a strong backlash?</p>
<p>It is clearly not the time for China to reason with the US, but to be rational in China-US conflicts. We must prevent more Hongkongers from being misled by US craftiness, which will eventually harm their interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington is determined to turn Hong Kong into a new front to strategically pressure Beijing. Some beguiled Hongkongers have been taken over by the illusion that the law could help their city gain a higher degree of autonomy, as they imagine Beijing would be deterred by the US legislation, and thus make major concessions that are not in line with the Basic Law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s key countermeasure against the law is to further clarify the fundamental rules of the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle, completely dispel Hong Kong radical opposition&#8217;s pipe dream to realize &#8220;absolute universal suffrage,&#8221; correct their misunderstanding of the principle, and firmly repulse US assessments of the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>We must leave no room for collusion and interaction between Hong Kong&#8217;s radical opposition and the US government. They may act alone and bear the costs, but shall never dream of jointly coercing Beijing.</p>
<p>It is the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress that holds the power of interpreting the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Facing the US&#8217; potential move to cancel Hong Kong&#8217;s special trade status with this law, Hong Kong society needs to behave in accordance with the Basic Law on major issues and cooperate with the central government to offer no pretext for the US to use this law. If the radical opposition interprets the Basic Law in an unconstitutional manner, mainstream society in Hong Kong must stand up against them and stop them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Hong Kong society has force strong enough to resist constitutional arrangements, thus helping the US resort to its law and causing further damage to the city&#8217;s business environment, it will be Hong Kong society&#8217;s misfortune. The city will suffer some pain and make necessary adjustments to its economic structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s special trade status is stipulated by the Basic Law, rather than awarded by the US. As long as the society sobers up and works hard with the motherland&#8217;s support, no external forces can truly wield influence over its destiny.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the law also threatens to sanction Hongkongers who do not cooperate with the US. This will suppress neutral space for people with different ideas and further tear the city apart. The only way to maintain the solidarity of Hong Kong is to resist US provocation and prevent more people from joining hands with the opposition for fear of US sanctions. Efforts to fight the forces colluding with the US should be stepped up, and the corresponding laws need to be improved. There is no way to allow traitors to prevail and patriots to suffer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;One country, two systems&#8221; is China&#8217;s independent constitutional arrangement and US intervention damages its external environment. Hong Kong society should be vigilant. To maintain &#8220;one country, two systems,&#8221; the Chinese mainland and the HKSAR need to work together. Anyone who colludes with external forces to undermine &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; must pay a heavy price.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once again launched direct attacks against the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Tuesday, claiming that the Party has engaged in &#8220;systematic repression of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a>.&#8221; This US State Secretary has been constantly peddling his clichés.</p>
<p>Radical political elites in Washington are adjusting their strategy of a public opinion war against China. They are increasingly focusing their efforts on discrediting the CPC, in an attempt to make their large-scale attacks on China less abrupt in the Western context, rouse Westerners&#8217; memory of the Cold War, and disguise their frantic geopolitical siege against China as an ideological battle in the face of &#8220;the threat posed by the CPC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pompeo and his likes have another malicious purpose: They are attempting to reduce the Chinese public&#8217;s resentment against them by shifting their attacks on China to mainly on the CPC. They try to drive a wedge between the Chinese people and the Party, and solicit Chinese domestic endorsement for their criticism. This adjustment is undoubtedly carefully plotted, but only wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Pompeo and his likes must have read some Chinese online posts attacking the CPC gathered by their intelligence agencies, which were written by a tiny minority of Chinese people. Based on past Cold War experience, they thought they had a chance. The US has collected quite a bit of information about China, but they are overly-subjective to make judgments &#8211; they always try to rationalize what they wish.</p>
<p>The CPC has led Chinese people to be truly independent, realize great economic growth in the past decades, fundamentally reshape people&#8217;s livelihood, and regain dignity in the world. The CPC has dedicated itself to the great rejuvenation of China. This is a consensus of Chinese people, and many Westerners cannot imagine how unshakable it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPC is a political party unlike any of those in the Western political systems. It is the builder of the country and it has integrated itself with the country. With parties coming in and leaving office, Western political systems in fact offer every political party exemptions of liability. Hence, the most important ability of Western political parties is to explain and defend themselves. However, shouldering numerous responsibilities for China, the CPC has nowhere to shift liability, but the only option is to lead the country forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPC, as well as the entire China, has always been busy solving problems. China&#8217;s system is oriented to tackling problems. The Party&#8217;s governance may have some flaws, and problems may appear in various places. But Chinese people will criticize the flaws and express dissatisfaction. If it weren&#8217;t for such high-profile attacks launched by Pompeo and his likes, the Chinese people would not stop to ponder over the question: What differences and significance does the CPC have, which triggered their smear? It is because the CPC&#8217;s leadership over China has brought Pompeo and his likes a deep sense of crisis, and because it is the Party that guarantees the country&#8217;s strong cohesion and a reliable mainstay. Despite US launch of an unprecedented and comprehensive trade war and mobilization of all kinds of political means to pressure China, its efforts seem in vain. Pompeo and his likes have figured one thing out: To contain China&#8217;s rise, it is a must to weaken the CPC&#8217;s authority and leadership, otherwise anything they do will be futile.</p>
<p>However, they are pursuing an unreachable goal. The CPC&#8217;s leadership is earned through hard work. It has become an important source of China&#8217;s national strength and a pillar of the country to resist pressures and challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are nearly 90 million members of the CPC in China, which means an extremely solid mass base and the integration between the Party and the country. If anyone hopes to crack down on the CPC, it is impossible to &#8220;break through the vulnerable spot,&#8221; as the confrontation is with the whole of China.</p>
<p>Washington will lead the US to a futile path, because it refuses to treat China realistically and to implement a practical China policy. The CPC places great emphasis on self-revolution. It is carrying out political and organizational construction in accordance with the reality and its own problems. Such process is highly coordinated with China&#8217;s progress, and injects new impetus into its advance. But US elites are sticking in the mud and even going backwards.</p>
<p>Most importantly, their groundless accusations against the CPC are a monstrous lie. China has come out on top of the global development competition. This fact speaks louder than any lie. China has not gone to war for decades. It has been coexisting with the rest of the world peacefully. This fact cannot be wantonly distorted by people like Pompeo. Their lies will not last long.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">People dance at a square during a culture and tourism festival themed on Dolan and Qiuci culture in Awat County of Aksu Prefecture, Northwest China&#8217;s <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region on October 25. The festival kicked off recently in Aksu Prefecture. Phont:Xinhua</p>
<p>Recently, BBC and several other Western media outlets claimed to have seen the &#8220;leaked documents&#8221; on Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and slandered vocational education and training centers there. For quite some time, the centers have been the target of certain Western media to attack China&#8217;s human rights record, and they are probably going to create more &#8220;leak&#8221; in order to keep up the heat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attacking China on human rights is what the US and Western public opinion institutions are good at. This is not because their accusations are correct, but because they can use their ridiculous rhetoric to instigate the Western public against China. The US and Western media do not actually care about whether doing so benefits China&#8217;s human rights development. What they want is to drive a wedge between China and Western public opinion by presenting a distorted description of China&#8217;s situation, especially the condition of Xinjiang vocational education and training centers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western elites who have been attacking China&#8217;s human rights record always evade very basic questions. For example, China&#8217;s political system has greatly promoted economic development. Better living conditions and increased modernization in metropolitan areas, aren&#8217;t those the development of human rights? Western media neglect all of these and just take the side of a few dissidents, always attacking China for the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Xinjiang, they cannot face up to one question: Is having a safe and peaceful living environment a prerequisite for human rights? Xinjiang suffered terrorist attacks for quite a long time, and the situation had almost gone out of control. Wouldn&#8217;t opening vocational education and training centers be a much more peaceful way to restore stability than going through a war like that in Chechnya?&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and the West have different standpoints on the issue of Xinjiang. What China really wants is to bring peaceful life back to the people there, and this is what real human rights are about. The reason the West likes to get involved in this issue is to a large extent out of hypocrisy. The West&#8217;s intention of heating up the issue of Xinjiang is purely driven by geopolitics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese people do not need to be upset by the nonsense Western elites dish out. The world is complicated, and most importantly, China&#8217;s detractors cannot have any real impact on the issue of Xinjiang. Their attacks may seem bustling, but actually turn out to be a bunch of bubbles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, they cannot have any impact on governance in Xinjiang. It has been three years since Xinjiang last saw a terror attack. Today&#8217;s Xinjiang is on its way to rapid recovery, and its booming tourism is the best evidence. Western media blast China nonstop, but they cannot have any actual influence on Xinjiang. They just cannot do anything about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, even with all these efforts that Western media put into, most countries do not follow them at all. Many Muslim countries publicly support China, backing China&#8217;s policy in Xinjiang. The whole &#8220;leaked documents&#8221; drama shows how unwilling Western media outlets are to accept their failure in attacking China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western media outlets take themselves too seriously to even regard their own voices as an expression of the entire world. All they do is just repost among themselves and asking some NGOs, which have been manipulated by certain intelligence agencies to create a circus. All their tricks have been exposed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xinjiang has been free of the haze of terrorism and extremism. The people in Xinjiang are on their way to a safer and more peaceful life. No one can speak for the people of Xinjiang. They are enjoying the same rights as other places in China. The future of Xinjiang is in their own hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The 2019 Hong Kong District Council Elections were held successfully on Sunday with the opposition capturing more than half of the 452 seats. The result was confirmed and respected. This has shown the central government&#8217;s sincerity in sticking to the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle.</p>
<p>Pan-democrats gained more influence through the ballot, which requires them to be more responsible to maintain order in Hong Kong. No matter what pan-democrats pursue, they must not do it at the cost of the rule of law, which is a core value of the city. The newly elected pan-democrat councilors should contribute to guiding the Hong Kong society to reach the consensus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being loyal to the Basic Law should be the prerequisite for every Hong Kong politician. This requires them to express political appeals through channels specified by the Basic Law, and respect its purpose.</p>
<p>The Basic Law assures the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, and solidly defends the &#8220;one country&#8221; principle in the city. Pan-democrats of Hong Kong need to be aware of and responsible for promoting coordination between the &#8220;two systems&#8221; and &#8220;one country&#8221; principle in the city. They must not lead the city to confront the central government. It&#8217;s believed most pan-democrats have the awareness of &#8220;one country&#8221; and won&#8217;t allow Hong Kong to become a bridgehead for the West to pressure China. This is the basic political ethics they should adhere to.</p>
<p>It is a wise choice for pan-democrats to promote democracy in Hong Kong while simultaneously safeguarding national security rather than undermining national security. Only after they straighten out this logic will they enjoy a broad and sustainable prospect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong radical opposition figures have colluded with the US and other outside forces in recent years. In the long run, those radicals will pay the price for temporary gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;One country, two systems&#8221; means to let Hong Kong people, not Westerners, rule Hong Kong. Beijing highly respects Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy, and won&#8217;t allow Western forces to meddle in Hong Kong affairs. Whoever helps Washington intervene in Hong Kong affairs is putting their political career at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid tensions between China and the US, Hong Kong pan-democrats should steer their political position well, keeping it in line with China&#8217;s national security. They should keep this in mind rather than covet short-term petty benefits and lose themselves.</p>
<p>Dozens of elected district councilors gathered near Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Monday to show solidarity with radical protesters, a move which highlights their political label. District councils typically focus on community issues, but some newly elected district councilors have acted as if they are members of the Legislative Council. It will go against the Basic Law if they want to turn themselves into the most active political force in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Democratic development in the city should be strictly in line with the Basic Law and coordinated with national security. Both Hong Kong and the central government need to figure out how to make it as &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; is still a new thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the world has deeply changed, to sustain &#8220;one country, two systems,&#8221; Hongkongers and mainlanders should seek truth from facts to solve various problems they face. Hong Kong will have a bright future only when they more closely join hands.</p>
<p>Pan-democrats gained more seats, but they should maintain political sobriety. The young newly elected, in particular, should keep a distance from those who betray the country and Hong Kong, and have the courage to explore a new political path in accordance with the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle. Hong Kong is a part of China, and never will it belong to the US or the West. Only by keeping this in mind and acting accordingly will they have a solid political career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">People dance outside the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> International Grand Bazaar in Urumqi, Northwest China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, May 22, 2019.&nbsp;Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>The Washington-headquartered International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on Sunday claimed they acquired secret documents about &#8220;detention camps&#8221; in China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. This is the second so-called leak of secret files about Xinjiang following the New York Times&#8217; &#8220;leaked files&#8221; last week. Western media outlets extensively followed the reports both times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, the Australian intelligence agency issued a rare public statement saying it&#8217;s investigating an alleged Chinese plot to plant a spy in the country&#8217;s parliament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia media previously reported that a car dealer surnamed Zhao allegedly was funded by Chinese government to run for a seat in the Federal Parliament. He was found dead in a hotel room in March. There is no conclusion about his death, but the Australian intelligence agency manipulated his relations with China like a tabloid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western media have launched various attacks on China recently, which go beyond reporting but constitute &#8220;a public opinion war&#8221; against China. Western intelligence agencies also stepped in, acting as the manipulator and commander of this public opinion warfare. Relevant institutions in the US, Britain and Australia, members of the &#8220;Five Eyes,&#8221; are involved the most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This series of attacks stem from the change in US strategy toward China. These public opinion institutions claimed they are &#8220;independent,&#8221; but are faithfully implementing the US&#8217; new hardline strategy against China. The China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, which is based on mutually beneficial cooperation, has been portrayed as a geopolitical tool and Chinese high-tech giant Huawei, a reform and opening-up pioneer, has become a target of the Western intelligence agencies. China&#8217;s economic rise, which has reshaped the livelihood of 1.4 billion people, is described as an evil movement. They are telling a big lie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since all of these are driven by the change of the US&#8217; China strategy, a public opinion war of this kind will become normal. China needs to make long-term preparations. China must raise its voice, deal with the challenge more proactively and effectively. China&#8217;s problem is few institutions want to speak up and they are not good at cooperating with media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take Mike Pence&#8217;s China speech. The US media published a preview of what he would talk about in advance. But when China issues a policy or an important report, government departments wouldn&#8217;t allow media to reveal related information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government departments are the authoritative sources of public information in every country. But Chinese government departments are conservative in providing information, worried about causing trouble for themselves. This is a great regret.</p>
<p>The most effective way to counter US public opinion war against China is to raise our voices while doing our own things well. We must strengthen our ability to expose slander and Western lies. Since the US launched the trade war with China, China has been expanding its openness while fighting back. China&#8217;s image in international trade is becoming increasingly better than the US&#8217; and people can see it.</p>

<p>Hong Kong district council elections were held in a largely safe and orderly environment on Sunday. A few radical opposition figures attempted to disrupt the proceedings to make it difficult for pro-establishment candidates and their supporters, but it did not have much impact. People had worried that unrest sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill could force the cancellation of elections, but that didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>Voting results show that pro-democrats have scored a landslide victory, winning a majority of the 452 seats open to elections, though the difference in actual votes received by the two camps was much smaller.</p>
<p>Hong Kong district council is different from the legislative council. As a publicly elected institution of 18 districts of Hong Kong, the district council&#8217;s function is to serve the community, express public&#8217;s appeal regarding livelihood, such as transportation, environment, and living conditions. This year&#8217;s district council elections were full of political slogans because of the extradition bill controversy. But regardless, neither side has much room to politicize the district council elections.</p>
<p>The unrest sparked by anti-extradition bill is still ongoing, which is conducive for pro-democracy camps to mobilize support in a short span of time. Hong Kong has been engulfed by riots in recent months, during which the irrational political energy has had its impact on elections, particularly exerting pressure on pro-establishment candidates and their supporters.</p>
<p>It must be pointed out that the West has been helping HK opposition in district council elections in the past week. Australian media suddenly broke a story of a Chinese spy infiltrating HK defecting to Australia (The man is a convicted fraudster). A former employee at British Consulate General in HK detained 3 months ago on the mainland for soliciting prostitutes told BBC last week he was tortured during detention. They are intended to influence public opinion on Hong Kong. US lawmakers hastily passed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, also targeting district council elections.</p>
<p>Hong Kong radical forces and Western supporters behind them wanted to stage a political demonstration during the voting. They tried to deny the urgency of ending chaos in Hong Kong. But we want to say that the pro-democracy camp winning more seats doesn&#8217;t mean Hong Kong voters support violent demonstrations. Majority of Hongkongers are tired of violence and are yearning for order to be restored.</p>
<p>Election result showed that there is still emotion within Hong Kong society, affecting rational thinking over the key issue of how the city should walk out of its current predicament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is conceivable and impossible that majority of Hongkongers would encourage violence, support political confrontation against the mainland, and back the city to become a bridgehead for US political forces to pressure China. This is because it will severely undermine the interests of Hongkongers and push the city into an environment of uncertainties. It is crucial to rationally interpret the result of Hong Kong&#8217;s district council elections, lest mobs should be emboldened by misreading them.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland follow different political systems. Expressing views by constitutional provisions such as votes should be encouraged in Hong Kong. The district council elections have had their impact but such influence has its limits. Both sides should be respected by all. All forces in Hong Kong, including the opposition, must compete for influence in the establishment. No one should follow the devious path of street politics.</p>
<p>It is believed that whatever the ups and downs in Hong Kong polls, all elections in the city are held within the aegis of the special administrative region of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, and they can&#8217;t impact the basic framework of &#8220;one country, two systems.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hoped that the pro-establishment groups in Hong Kong will not be discouraged, and Hongkongers who love the country and the city will not be disheartened after the district council elections. As long as elections are held, there will be swings. What&#8217;s more, in such an unfavorable situation, the pro-establishment camp still received about 40 percent of the votes.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s development and progress are unstoppable. Hong Kong&#8217;s politics will certainly be increasingly linked to China&#8217;s development and progress. This is the major historical trend. The country will never abandon Hong Kong, and will never ignore the people and forces who love the motherland and the city. Hong Kong&#8217;s problems need objective analysis and practical solutions. The country will always provide guarantees for Hong Kong.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: Screenshot of SBSNews</p>
<p>Australian media recently reported that a &#8220;Chinese spy&#8221; named Wang Liqiang had decided to &#8220;defect to Australia.&#8221; According to anti-China newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald, Wang worked in Hong Kong at China Innovation Investment Limited, a company that the media claimed was set up to &#8220;infiltrate into Hong Kong&#8217;s financial market&#8221; and to collect &#8220;military intelligence.&#8221; Wang said he has &#8220;personally been involved and participated in a series of espionage activities.&#8221; He also said he was involved in the &#8220;kidnapping&#8221; of the booksellers from Causeway Bay Books in Hong Kong in 2015, adding that he was responsible for the &#8220;negotiation and tasks to be implemented.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang claimed that their work on Taiwan aimed at &#8220;infiltration into media, temples and grass-roots organisations.&#8221; Wang said they successfully influenced the 2018<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//content/964129.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taiwan election</a>s and that he was given a &#8220;fake South Korean passport&#8221; to interfere in the 2020 &#8220;presidential election&#8221; in Taiwan. He also disclosed alleged details of &#8220;China&#8217;s actions to exert political influence in Australia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ordinary people would think Wang is a veteran intelligence officer holding an important position, based on these media reports, however, Wang is only 26 years old &#8211; some Western media said he is 27 &#8211; and his wife and child are in Australia. His publicly stated purpose of defecting to Australia is to seek political asylum.</p>
<p>Chinese people would intuitively know that Wang sounds like an opportunistic liar, probably a swindler. Indeed, Shanghai police said on late Saturday evening that Wang is an ex-convict. He was previously sentenced to 15 months in prison in 2016 for fraud and put on probation for 18 months. Now the guy is trying to cheat internationally.</p>
<p>To work in China&#8217;s national security establishment, one has to pass the civil service examination. Many hold graduate or a PhD degree, or bachelor&#8217;s degree at the minimum. A 26-year-old person can only be a novice, so how could he hold an important position as Wang claimed? Wang was only 22 years old in 2015, and even if he was lucky enough to work in the national security department at such a young age, he would be in a training or intern program. How could he possibly be responsible for the &#8220;negotiation and tasks to be implemented?&#8221; The only explanation is that Wang made it up.</p>
<p>Besides, it is extremely rare that a person who works in China&#8217;s national security establishment to have a child as early as 26. It is especially bizarre that an intelligence officer&#8217;s wife and child both live in Australia. How can Wang&#8217;s hollow lies fool Australia&#8217;s intelligence agency? If Australia&#8217;s intelligence agency really believed Wang, it would have taken secret counter-espionage actions instead of letting the media expose it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems more likely that Australia&#8217;s intelligence agency is aware of Wang&#8217;s opportunistic purposes and does not think his story has any intelligence value. But Australia finds his story valuable in public opinion. Thus The Sydney Morning Herald, a media organization that likes to smear China, has hyped Wang&#8217;s story into an explosive story.</p>
<p>Now they have all got what they wanted. Australia&#8217;s intelligence agency has shown its loyalty to the Western system, the Australian media has gained enough attention, and Wang has more chance of being granted political asylum.</p>
<p>The disgusting farce has fooled many Western people. The atmosphere of hostility toward China has been intensified in Western public opinion. Western media reports on China now only care about stance and completely ignore facts and logic.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Xisha Islands in the South China Sea Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Two US Navy vessels, littoral combat ship Gabrielle Giffords and the destroyer Wayne E. Meyer, trespassed into the adjacent sea area of the Nansha Islands and the territorial waters of the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea on Wednesday and Thursday. The Gabrielle Giffords sailed within 12 nautical miles of the Meiji Reef. The Chinese navy and air force tracked and monitored the two vessels, verified them and warned them to leave.</p>
<p>This is the latest US move to increase military interference and show off its muscle in the South China Sea. It is also part of its continuing provocation against China&#8217;s sovereignty in the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US military has made two tactical changes. First, this was the first time that a US littoral combat ship carried out such a task. Previously, US warships would pass by the South China Sea to show off their muscle after performing other tasks. But this time, the littoral combat ship may have come just to conduct the mission. Littoral combat ships are more flexible compared to traditional destroyers. Second, the two vessels trespassed into the Nansha Islands and Xisha Islands at the same time. They generally went to one area in the past.</p>
<p>China should deal with the changes with targeted measures.</p>
<p>The two incidents happened when US Defense Secretary Mark Esper&#8217;s trip to Asia was coming to an end. People generally believe this echoes Esper&#8217;s provocative statements in Asia. However, comparing US statements on the South China Sea with its actions, people will find them contradictory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, Esper said US freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea have been more frequent in 2019 than at any time in the past 25 years. But the situation in the South China Sea in 2019 has been eased compared to a few years ago. Why have US warships come to the region even more often? Doesn&#8217;t this prove that Washington is the spoiler of the South China Sea?</p>
<p>During the 22nd<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1060150.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China-</a><br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a> (10+1) leaders&#8217; meeting on November 3, all parties felt encouraged by the progress in consultations on the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea. ASEAN members have expressed many times that they do not want to choose sides between China and the US, and they hope the US can respect China and ASEAN members&#8217; joint effort to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. ASEAN members are certainly aware of Washington&#8217;s real intention of interfering in the region.</p>
<p>Countries in the South China Sea are holding the initiative in their own hands because they have remained clear-headed in their strategy. The US military provocation has not been very effective. Thus, the US changed its strategy.</p>
<p>But sending two warships and trespassing two territorial waters will not change anything as well. No matter how many warships the US sends, will Vietnam, the Philippines or any other country in the area recklessly oppose China? Will it weaken China&#8217;s control over the relevant islands and reefs? Will it change China&#8217;s sovereignty in the area? No.</p>
<p>Every time a US warship comes to the South China Sea, the US military will hype it on media. The US Navy may need such ridiculous performances to seek a greater military budget from Congress. But these are destructive in the South China Sea. We should increase the cost of such a performance until it is unbearable for the US.</p>
<p>Spokesperson of the Southern Theater Command of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army warned on Friday that China has urged the US to stop such provocative and risky actions to avoid possible accidents. The US military should carefully think about what &#8220;avoid possible accidents&#8221; means.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Mark Esper has tried to drive a wedge between Asian countries and China during his recent visit to the region. During his meeting with defense ministers of<br />
  <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a> countries, he asked ASEAN countries to be wary of China&#8217;s manipulation of the South China Sea Code of Conduct (COC), which however is a joint effort between the bloc and China. In the Philippines, he further advocated that the US-Philippines mutual defense treaty applies to the South China Sea and encouraged the Philippines to be openly tough on China. On a visit to Hanoi, he announced that the US is providing Vietnam with a surplus American ship for its coast guard.</p>
<p>Esper called on regional countries to unite with the US to put pressure on China. We believe that the US Secretary of Defense will certainly understand it when he leaves. He gained little as the countries he visited only paid lip service to him.</p>
<p>Of course, Vietnam welcomes the US decision to give it a free ship. But Vietnam will not use the vessel to run into a Chinese ship. Manila also welcomes the US&#8217; statements that support the country, but the Philippines will not think that it has the resources to provoke China and start fighting in the South China Sea for US interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Territorial disputes in the South China Sea continue, but their intensity has mitigated from previous years, and their role in regional relations has become less crucial. The rationality of managing territorial disputes and making economic cooperation a central theme in the region is on the rise. There have been frictions between China, Vietnam and the Philippines this year, but they have not worsened because the parties do not want these rows to seriously impact the general atmosphere of regional friendship and cooperation.</p>
<p>It is outside powers that want the South China Sea dispute to stay hot. To put it bluntly, it is the US that wants to raise more waves in the South China Sea through interference and influence. The other powers are Washington&#8217;s minions. But it is hard to mobilize Southeast Asian countries to do the US&#8217; bidding against China, and it is becoming all the more difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ASEAN countries welcome the US to the South China Sea and also would like to see the US and China compete in the South China Sea, because it will help maximize their benefits. But they will refuse to take sides between China and the US, and they do not want the game between the two giants to escalate into a bitter confrontation, which will mean huge risk to them.</p>
<p>The more the US confronts China and tries to use its neighbors, the more it will find its ability falls short of its ambition in the South China Sea. These countries accept US&#8217; gift, but won&#8217;t really want to do its bidding.</p>
<p>Washington thinks it could rope in Southeast Asian countries to confront China by using Indo-Pacific strategy, giving several ships and offering empty promises. Are those countries so foolish?</p>
<p>Even Esper is concerned about establishing reliable mechanisms for managing crises and reducing risks between the US and China, which country would want to have an uncertain relationship with China?</p>
<p>As Asia becomes more mature, the desire and consensus of all parties to jointly manage differences is getting stronger. The US must not overestimate its ability to disrupt Asia by playing tricks. It will get tired and face disappointment.</p>

<p>The US Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed the &#8220;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,&#8221; a move that seriously tarnished sacred terms like &#8220;human rights&#8221; and &#8220;democracy.&#8221; The bill&#8217;s real title should be &#8220;Support Hong Kong Violence Act&#8221; as it has overtly taken sides with rioters who are destroying the rule of law in Hong Kong. And it has targeted the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government and Hong Kong police, who are struggling to prevent chaos from turning into anarchy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core of the new US bill is to oppose HKSAR government&#8217;s efforts to stop violence, end chaos as well as to prevent the Chinese central government from saving Hong Kong under any circumstance. The most prominent clause subjects the city to an annual review for its special trade status, which would strip Hong Kong of the status.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some opposition figures in Hong Kong stupidly kowtow to Washington and express their gratitude for US support for the radical protesters&#8217; &#8220;democracy struggle.&#8221; But if the US imposes economic sanctions on Hong Kong, all Hong Kong people will have to bear the consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the bill is signed by the US president, subtle changes will take place in Hong Kong&#8217;s international business environment, because of the uncertainties caused by the US. American investors in Hong Kong will panic, and the city&#8217;s geoeconomic status and function will be reevaluated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some may expect this to deter Beijing. Such thinking is naïve. Hong Kong is in a mess, but the country hasn&#8217;t intervened so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the Chinese central government encourages the city to stop violence and end chaos under the leadership of the HKSAR government, solve the conundrum under the framework of the Basic Law and not use the provisions of the Basic Law for emergency situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if the chaos continues, even paralyzes the city and destroys ordinary people&#8217;s lives, how can the central government not intervene?</p>
<p>Passing the act is the US attempt to disrupt the People&#8217;s Republic of China&#8217;s governance over Hong Kong, weaken the HKSAR government, and compel the police to be afraid of cracking down on radical rioters in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The US is hoping that Hong Kong falls into disorder for a long time. If we take this US bill seriously and shrink from tackling riots, Hong Kong will suffer from an accelerated collapse of the rule of law and be erased from the modern world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong has long acted as an interface linking China and the West. The US move will undermine that function of the city. But no matter what challenges Hong Kong will have to face, it will be far better than what it faces now: Streets are full of roadblocks; subway stations are burned; schools cannot re-open; and many businesses are forced to stop.</p>
<p>If riots continue, Hong Kong is doomed. The threat from the US is much less than the damage the city is currently suffering.</p>
<p>What the bill brings is not fear, but anger. People see certain US politicians&#8217; malice against Hong Kong and the entire China between the lines.</p>
<p>It is believed that with the central government&#8217;s support, Hong Kong will resolutely reject the US threat. Hong Kong&#8217;s special trade status is entitled by the Basic Law. The US attitude does not represent the international community&#8217;s. Hong Kong&#8217;s future is bound to that of the entire China, instead of the US.&nbsp;</p>
