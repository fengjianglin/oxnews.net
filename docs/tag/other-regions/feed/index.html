<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Sri Lanka&#8217;s new President Gotabaya Rajapaksa speaks during his first address to the nation in Anuradhapura of North Central Province, Sri Lanka, on Monday. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s former defense chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sworn in as the country&#8217;s new president on Monday, after he won the weekend election. Since Rajapaksa is widely perceived to be &#8220;pro-China,&#8221; his inauguration is considered the beginning of Sri Lanka&#8217;s tilt toward the world&#8217;s second largest economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and Sri Lanka share a traditional friendship. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386-589), Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist monk who brought a large number of Buddhist books back to China after his foreign trip, had lived in Sri Lanka for a long time on his way back and became an important figure in the history of Sri Lankan Buddhism. In renowned Chinese navigator Zheng He&#8217;s voyage during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Zheng landed in Sri Lanka several times. At that time, Sri Lanka had also sent officials to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1952, before China and Sri Lanka established diplomatic ties, when China was under sanctions from the West and Sri Lanka was facing a foreign exchange crisis, the two countries inked the Rubber-Rice Pact agreement, in which China agreed to provide rice in exchange for Sri Lankan rubber. The deal resolved the urgency in both countries, and showed the two as reliable partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After former Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena assumed office on January 9, 2015, China-Sri Lanka ties had gone through twists and turns with some major cooperation projects being put on hold. There are three major reasons. First, opposition stems from the nature of electoral politics. Second, the pressure and temptation from the international community made Sirisena think he could use relations with China to trade for more assistance from other countries. Third, given the contradictions between different interest groups within the country, only change can lead to opportunities for a new government to make gains. Yet eventually, Sri Lanka failed to obtain more assistance from other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, China-Sri Lanka relations are deeply rooted in the public opinion in the island country. Quite a few important infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka have been built by China, including Hambantota Port, Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Norochcholai Power Station and Colombo International Financial City. These achievements cannot be undone by government changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Rajapaksa has started his term in office, there will be more opportunities for China and Sri Lanka to develop relations. In September, Rajapaksa&#8217;s adviser Palitha Kohona said, &#8220;When Gotabaya Rajapaksa becomes the president&#8230; he will set the record right&#8221; and restore the relationship with China to where it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, not everyone is pleased to see China and Sri Lanka develop closer ties. Some are worried that the island country would greatly depend on China economically, politically and militarily, which would boost China&#8217;s influence on Sri Lanka, thus affecting the power structure around the Indian Ocean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a country&#8217;s goal is to obtain strategic monopoly in South Asia and North Indian Ocean, any other nation&#8217;s rapid development or cooperation with major powers outside the region can be considered a threat. But if a country&#8217;s major goal is regional peace and development, it would welcome China&#8217;s investment and collaboration with countries in the region. It is believed Rajapaksa will draft his foreign policy based on his understanding of Sri Lanka&#8217;s interests. Fundamentally speaking, Rajapaksa is not &#8220;pro-China,&#8221; but pro-Sri Lanka.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s foreign policy is determined by its domestic conditions. It is an island country in the Indian Ocean and separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Palk Strait. Its location has given Sri Lanka more strategic freedom than other South Asian countries to determine its own diplomacy independently. Although Sri Lanka is not a developed country, its economic statistics are better than most other South Asian economies. Its populations have every reason to pursue higher economic goals. The country sits in the Indian Ocean along one of the world&#8217;s busiest shipping lanes, which is supposed to bring Sri Lanka enormous wealth. However, given its poor infrastructure, it has been hard for the country to benefit from the transportation route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooperation with China mirrors Sri Lanka&#8217;s wish to use its geographical advantage and to turn itself into a transport hub in the North Indian Ocean. However, Colombo&#8217;s ambition has made other major regional powers uneasy. They have the right to be concerned. But Sri Lanka also has the right to make policies that are in line with its own interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Relations between China and Japan have seen an uptick since the China-Japan-South Korea Trilateral Summit in Tokyo in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two countries agreed in principle to Chinese President Xi Jinping&#8217;s state visit to Japan next spring at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The exchange visits of the leaders come after years of fraught ties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although China-Japan relations are on the way to recover from their lowest point, they still need time to reach a certain stage where ties can be considered satisfactory</p>
<p>Global politics and economy are passing through a flux unseen in a century: the fragmentation of the liberal international order, resurgence of trade unilateralism and protectionism, and global climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether China and Japan as the second and third largest economies in the world can strengthen cooperation and share responsibilities in this new wave of &#8220;great changes&#8221; will have a significant impact on the well being of the people of the two countries and their national standing in the global power matrix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bilateral economic and social ties have demonstrated unprecedented vitality. As of 2018, bilateral trade had exceeded $300 billion and the number of personnel exchanges had reached almost 12 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two have gradually become indispensable partners for the dynamism of the value chains of medium and high-end manufacturing and technological innovation.</p>
<p>The trade war on China unilaterally launched by the Trump administration has begun to significantly drag down the Japanese economy. According to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/13.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Finance</a> of Japan, Japan&#8217;s goods trade recorded a deficit of 847.99 billion yen ($7.81 billion) for the first half of fiscal 2019 (April to September), marking the second consecutive half-year period in red.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, China-Japan relations rest on interdependence.</p>
<p>Relations have continued to warm since 2019. Tokyo is not willing to do US bidding in economy and trade, but continues to encourage Japanese enterprises to increase investment in China. However, the structural constraints between the two Asian powers still exist.</p>
<p>The 2019 white paper issued by Japan&#8217;s Defense Ministry in September clearly defined China as the main security threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the negative perception of China in Japan hasn&#8217;t significantly diminished. According to a poll by the Japanese think tank &#8220;Genron NPO&#8221; released on October 24, 44.8 percent Japanese considered relations with China &#8220;bad,&#8221; with a 6-point rise from 2018.</p>
<p>The improvement in ties requires more effort and adaptability.</p>
<p>First, China does not need to avoid structural differences and disputes in relations with Japan. It is those differences that China should eliminate for better relations. After the Cold War, Japan has a long history of strategic doubts about China. It will take some time to rebuild confidence and change their views of each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, though the security factor in relations cannot be underestimated, the two countries can also set up a pattern of &#8220;coopetition.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognizing that China-Japan relations are one of the most complex and sensitive among major countries, doing away with a mindset of &#8220;problem-based perspective&#8221; when dealing with&nbsp; ties and giving due respect and understanding each other should be the &#8220;attitude toward Japan&#8221; China needs to re-establish.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, Beijing and Tokyo need to build up strategic confidence and determination in improving ties. Although affected by US-Japan relations, China&#8217;s ties with Japan should not be forever subject to Washington&#8217;s whims as long as Beijing skillfully handles relations with Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will not be wise for China to expect a sudden spurt in ties, but there is a need for making a real difference in its Japan strategy.</p>
