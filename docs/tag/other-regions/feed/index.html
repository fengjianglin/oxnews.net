<p>Myanmar President U Win Myint met here Saturday with visiting Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi with both sides pledging to strengthen high-level exchanges to push bilateral ties to a new high.</p>
<p>The Myanmar president expressed gratitude to China for its long-term support for Myanmar&#8217;s sovereignty, dignity and socio-economic development.</p>
<p>He hoped that both sides will seize the 70th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic relations next year as an opportunity to consolidate and deepen mutual political trust, speed up the joint construction of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a>, comprehensively press forward the building of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, expand cooperation in sectors including economy and trade, education, health, and enhance cooperation and coordination in regional and international issues so as to further advance the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries.</p>
<p>The president also hoped that China would continue to support Myanmar in pressing forward the ongoing national reconciliation and peace process.</p>
<p>For his part, the Chinese state councilor said China and Myanmar are neighbors linked by rivers and mountains enjoying a &#8220;baobo&#8221; (brothers and relatives) friendship. Both countries advocate and practise the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, setting an example of equality and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries.</p>
<p>He pledged that China will continue to firmly support Myanmar&#8217;s efforts in pursuing a development path suited to its own national conditions, protecting its legitimate rights and national integrity in the international arena and maintaining its overall development and stability. China also appreciates Myanmar&#8217;s firm support for China on issues bearing on its core interests and major concerns, he said.</p>
<p>As the two countries will celebrate 70 years&#8217; diplomatic ties next year, China is willing to join hands with Myanmar to sum up experiences in bilateral cooperation in the past years while planing for future development of bilateral ties and carrying out a series of celebration activities, Wang said.</p>
<p>The Chinese state councilor said China is ready to strengthen high-level exchanges with Myanmar in the new year to push the bilateral comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership to a new high.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">People chant slogans in a protest to condemn US withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in Tehran, Iran, on May 11, 2018. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>China and Iran have reached agreements on the Iran nuclear issue and vowed to keep deepening their ties amid the difficulties and challenges caused by the US sanctions and withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).</p>
<p>Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu held bilateral talks in Beijing on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two senior diplomats blamed the US for its withdrawal from JCPOA and its pressure on Iran resulting in a regional crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the Chinese<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, said at Monday&#8217;s routine press conference that the Iran nuclear issue was of vital importance to the two countries&#8217; strategic cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and Iran would continuously consolidate mutual understanding, deepen cooperation and benefit people from the two countries, Hua said.</p>
<p>The sanctions are unsustainable, which also shows the US is selfishly and rudely destroying regional prosperity and stability, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US pulled out of the historic Iran nuclear deal in 2018.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Embassy of Iran to China told the Global Times on Monday that the two countries&#8217; agreement to uphold JCPOA promoted multilateral diplomacy and preserved regional and international peace and security.</p>
<p>The spokesperson urged the US to lift all unilateral sanctions and return to the implementation of the nuclear deal and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Iran and China do not need permission from third countries in order to advance and deepen their bilateral trade and economic relations and they are determined to pursue the mutual interests of their people,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>In June, China and Russia released a joint announcement, claiming that the two countries will always support the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They said that the US unilateral sanctions were &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday agreed that both sides should work together to further improve bilateral ties and strengthen people-to-people exchanges.</p>
<p>Japan and China have witnessed frequent high-level exchanges and positive progress in the improvement of bilateral relations recently, said Abe, adding that the Japanese side is eagerly looking forward to Chinese President Xi Jinping&#8217;s state visit next spring and believes that it will be a major opportunity for promoting bilateral relations in the new era.</p>
<p>A stable Japan-China relationship is the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Asia, and is also crucial to addressing current global challenges. Japan is ready to work with China to usher in a new future of bilateral relations, he said.</p>
<p>Japan welcomes the launch of the high-level consultation mechanism on people-to-people exchanges between the two countries and stands ready to work with China to continuously boost the affinity between the two peoples and properly handle sensitive differences so as to create a favorable atmosphere and conditions for the improvement and development of bilateral relations, he added.</p>
<p>Abe also said he is looking forward to further in-depth communication with Chinese leaders on bilateral ties during his visit to China next month to attend the China-Japan-ROK (Republic of Korea) leaders&#8217; meeting.</p>
<p>Wang, for his part, said that with the political guidance of the two leaders and joint efforts of both sides, China-Japan relations have returned to the right track and have seen a sound momentum of improvement and development. The top leaders of the two countries had a successful meeting in Osaka in June and reached important consensus on building bilateral relations that meet the requirements of the new era.</p>
<p>The China-Japan relations have gone through twists and turns and the present situation has not come easily and should be doubly cherished, Wang said.</p>
<p>The two sides should push for continuous improvement and development of China-Japan relations from a longer-term and broader perspective, he said.</p>
<p>He called on the Japanese side to meet China halfway, take more positive actions, properly manage and handle differences so as to create a favorable atmosphere and conditions for the proposed major political and diplomatic agenda of the two countries.</p>
<p>The improvement and development of China-Japan relations not only conform to the interests of the two countries and peoples but also has great positive significance to regional peace and stability, injecting stability into the current world situation which is full of uncertainty, said Wang.</p>
<p>The Chinese side welcomes Abe to attend the China-Japan-ROK leaders&#8217; meeting in China next month. China is willing to work with Japan to give full play to the role of the high-level consultation mechanism on people-to-people exchanges, usher in a new era of exchanges between our peoples, localities and youth, and create a brighter future for bilateral relations, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Sri Lanka&#8217;s new President Gotabaya Rajapaksa speaks during his first address to the nation in Anuradhapura of North Central Province, Sri Lanka, on Monday. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s former defense chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sworn in as the country&#8217;s new president on Monday, after he won the weekend election. Since Rajapaksa is widely perceived to be &#8220;pro-China,&#8221; his inauguration is considered the beginning of Sri Lanka&#8217;s tilt toward the world&#8217;s second largest economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and Sri Lanka share a traditional friendship. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties (386-589), Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist monk who brought a large number of Buddhist books back to China after his foreign trip, had lived in Sri Lanka for a long time on his way back and became an important figure in the history of Sri Lankan Buddhism. In renowned Chinese navigator Zheng He&#8217;s voyage during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Zheng landed in Sri Lanka several times. At that time, Sri Lanka had also sent officials to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1952, before China and Sri Lanka established diplomatic ties, when China was under sanctions from the West and Sri Lanka was facing a foreign exchange crisis, the two countries inked the Rubber-Rice Pact agreement, in which China agreed to provide rice in exchange for Sri Lankan rubber. The deal resolved the urgency in both countries, and showed the two as reliable partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After former Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena assumed office on January 9, 2015, China-Sri Lanka ties had gone through twists and turns with some major cooperation projects being put on hold. There are three major reasons. First, opposition stems from the nature of electoral politics. Second, the pressure and temptation from the international community made Sirisena think he could use relations with China to trade for more assistance from other countries. Third, given the contradictions between different interest groups within the country, only change can lead to opportunities for a new government to make gains. Yet eventually, Sri Lanka failed to obtain more assistance from other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, China-Sri Lanka relations are deeply rooted in the public opinion in the island country. Quite a few important infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka have been built by China, including Hambantota Port, Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Norochcholai Power Station and Colombo International Financial City. These achievements cannot be undone by government changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Rajapaksa has started his term in office, there will be more opportunities for China and Sri Lanka to develop relations. In September, Rajapaksa&#8217;s adviser Palitha Kohona said, &#8220;When Gotabaya Rajapaksa becomes the president&#8230; he will set the record right&#8221; and restore the relationship with China to where it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, not everyone is pleased to see China and Sri Lanka develop closer ties. Some are worried that the island country would greatly depend on China economically, politically and militarily, which would boost China&#8217;s influence on Sri Lanka, thus affecting the power structure around the Indian Ocean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a country&#8217;s goal is to obtain strategic monopoly in South Asia and North Indian Ocean, any other nation&#8217;s rapid development or cooperation with major powers outside the region can be considered a threat. But if a country&#8217;s major goal is regional peace and development, it would welcome China&#8217;s investment and collaboration with countries in the region. It is believed Rajapaksa will draft his foreign policy based on his understanding of Sri Lanka&#8217;s interests. Fundamentally speaking, Rajapaksa is not &#8220;pro-China,&#8221; but pro-Sri Lanka.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s foreign policy is determined by its domestic conditions. It is an island country in the Indian Ocean and separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Palk Strait. Its location has given Sri Lanka more strategic freedom than other South Asian countries to determine its own diplomacy independently. Although Sri Lanka is not a developed country, its economic statistics are better than most other South Asian economies. Its populations have every reason to pursue higher economic goals. The country sits in the Indian Ocean along one of the world&#8217;s busiest shipping lanes, which is supposed to bring Sri Lanka enormous wealth. However, given its poor infrastructure, it has been hard for the country to benefit from the transportation route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooperation with China mirrors Sri Lanka&#8217;s wish to use its geographical advantage and to turn itself into a transport hub in the North Indian Ocean. However, Colombo&#8217;s ambition has made other major regional powers uneasy. They have the right to be concerned. But Sri Lanka also has the right to make policies that are in line with its own interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Relations between China and Japan have seen an uptick since the China-Japan-South Korea Trilateral Summit in Tokyo in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two countries agreed in principle to Chinese President Xi Jinping&#8217;s state visit to Japan next spring at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The exchange visits of the leaders come after years of fraught ties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although China-Japan relations are on the way to recover from their lowest point, they still need time to reach a certain stage where ties can be considered satisfactory</p>
<p>Global politics and economy are passing through a flux unseen in a century: the fragmentation of the liberal international order, resurgence of trade unilateralism and protectionism, and global climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether China and Japan as the second and third largest economies in the world can strengthen cooperation and share responsibilities in this new wave of &#8220;great changes&#8221; will have a significant impact on the well being of the people of the two countries and their national standing in the global power matrix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bilateral economic and social ties have demonstrated unprecedented vitality. As of 2018, bilateral trade had exceeded $300 billion and the number of personnel exchanges had reached almost 12 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two have gradually become indispensable partners for the dynamism of the value chains of medium and high-end manufacturing and technological innovation.</p>
<p>The trade war on China unilaterally launched by the Trump administration has begun to significantly drag down the Japanese economy. According to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/13.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Finance</a> of Japan, Japan&#8217;s goods trade recorded a deficit of 847.99 billion yen ($7.81 billion) for the first half of fiscal 2019 (April to September), marking the second consecutive half-year period in red.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, China-Japan relations rest on interdependence.</p>
<p>Relations have continued to warm since 2019. Tokyo is not willing to do US bidding in economy and trade, but continues to encourage Japanese enterprises to increase investment in China. However, the structural constraints between the two Asian powers still exist.</p>
<p>The 2019 white paper issued by Japan&#8217;s Defense Ministry in September clearly defined China as the main security threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the negative perception of China in Japan hasn&#8217;t significantly diminished. According to a poll by the Japanese think tank &#8220;Genron NPO&#8221; released on October 24, 44.8 percent Japanese considered relations with China &#8220;bad,&#8221; with a 6-point rise from 2018.</p>
<p>The improvement in ties requires more effort and adaptability.</p>
<p>First, China does not need to avoid structural differences and disputes in relations with Japan. It is those differences that China should eliminate for better relations. After the Cold War, Japan has a long history of strategic doubts about China. It will take some time to rebuild confidence and change their views of each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, though the security factor in relations cannot be underestimated, the two countries can also set up a pattern of &#8220;coopetition.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognizing that China-Japan relations are one of the most complex and sensitive among major countries, doing away with a mindset of &#8220;problem-based perspective&#8221; when dealing with&nbsp; ties and giving due respect and understanding each other should be the &#8220;attitude toward Japan&#8221; China needs to re-establish.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, Beijing and Tokyo need to build up strategic confidence and determination in improving ties. Although affected by US-Japan relations, China&#8217;s ties with Japan should not be forever subject to Washington&#8217;s whims as long as Beijing skillfully handles relations with Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will not be wise for China to expect a sudden spurt in ties, but there is a need for making a real difference in its Japan strategy.</p>

<p>A team of US economists, diplomats and lawyers was dispatched to Myanmar to &#8220;scrutinize contracts, flag bad deals, and empower the country to push for better terms with Chinese agencies and companies,&#8221; the Wall Street Journal reported, amid concerns that a Chinese-funded deep water port may land Myanmar in a so-called debt trap.</p>
<p>Can the US be the developing country&#8217;s best advocate and consultant? The answer is an obvious no. Myanmar-US relations are less rosy than they appear. The US in the past year has imposed sanctions on four Myanmar security officials, accusing them of &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; against<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1064947.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rohingya</a> Muslims. The leaders of the US and Myanmar differ on a series of matters including the Rohingya issue. It&#8217;s hard to imagine that the US, as an imposer of sanctions, can think from Myanmar&#8217;s perspective to safeguard the interests of a country upon which the US itself has imposed sanctions.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Myanmar has faced sanctions. The US imposed a broad range of sanctions on Myanmar more than 15 years ago and lifted them in 2016. The sanctions weighed on economic development, especially Myanmar&#8217;s much-needed infrastructure construction. However, the US turned a blind eye to the tough lives of people in Myanmar. At the most difficult time for Myanmar&#8217;s economy, China agreed to provide loans at preferential interest rates for the Yeywa Hydropower Station, which now provides a stable supply of power for households in cities including Yangon.</p>
<p>Why has the formerly apathetic US become an enthusiastic &#8220;consultant&#8221; for Myanmar? What the US wants to do is countering China&#8217;s growing influence in Southeast Asia. It&#8217;s understandable Washington may want to instigate antagonism with China in Myanmar to sabotage cooperation under the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative%20News%20Desk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative ahead of the second Belt and Road Forum. The so-called economic advice only serves to give Washington an excuse to interfere in Myanmar&#8217;s internal affairs.</p>
<p>With America First as the guiding principle, the economic advice offered by the US can&#8217;t be objective. There is no lack of examples when it comes to economic issues being politicized by the US government. In December, Canada warned the US not to politicize extradition cases, a day after US President Donald Trump reportedly suggested he could intervene in the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, Myanmar will not allow the US to politicize its development opportunities brought by Chinese investment.</p>
<p>Myanmar is in urgent need of foreign investment for an economic take-off, but the country doesn&#8217;t have too many choices other than China, a country that leads in global infrastructure investment. China is willing to cooperate with Myanmar, and we believe the Southeast Asian nation has the same willingness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>US can&#8217;t be the bargaining chip in Myanmar&#8217;s economic negotiations with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myanmar should realize that the US is moving to contain China on the global stage, thus what the US is doing in Myanmar is merely part of the strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Djibouti&#8217;s President Ismail Omar Guelleh now has a deep impression of a Chinese carpenter who lived 2,400 years ago. The opening ceremony of a workshop named after carpenter Lu Ban was held recently in the tiny African nation, during which Guelleh said the workshop will &#8220;further enhance the competitiveness of Djibouti through the development of successful young talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The workshop, which is aimed at providing quality vocational training to local people, especially Djibouti&#8217;s youth, comes across as being misinterpreted in the US and France. Some people in those countries have the impression that China is trying to cozy up to Djibouti with its money. &#8220;Djibouti needed help, China had money, and now the US and France are worried,&#8221; said an op-ed piece in Bloomberg.</p>
<p>This line of logic is simple: China pushes forward the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/Belt%20and%20Road%20Initiative%20News%20Desk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI) by offering a torrent of money, which has resulted in debt distress in the African nation. They believe the rising debt makes Djibouti face the potential of &#8220;ceding strategic assets&#8221; to China, and such a notion arouses vigilance in Western countries. It seems Chinese money is an important source of concern in the West. This is also the crux of the West&#8217;s wariness of the BRI. But if money is the cornerstone of China-Djibouti relations, how should we explain projects such as the Luban workshop, which aims at sharing China&#8217;s experience from its own development? Djibouti and the West have very different impressions of China&#8217;s presence in the African country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Economic assistance from China focuses on sharing development experience with African countries by financing projects in fields such as education, infrastructure and people-to-people exchanges. A well-known Chinese proverb says &#8220;If you want to get rich, build a road first.&#8221; Chinese economic assistance brings development experience to Africa as it finances airports, logistics support bases, and traffic arteries such as the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s support and assistance come with no political strings attached and do not interfere in African countries&#8217; internal affairs. This practice has developed a new form of economic relations that focus on sharing development experience instead of ideology and political philosophy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems Djibouti has a comprehensive relationship with China, and measuring this ties with money can only show the narrow mind of the West.</p>
