<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Windows of a commercial building in Hong Kong are blown out during Super Typhoon Mangkhut on Sunday. Photo: AFP </p>
<p>Typhoon Mangkhut, dubbed the &#8220;king of storms&#8221; by Chinese meteorologists and twice the size of Hurricane Florence in the US, made landfall at around 5 pm in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province on Sunday, causing two deaths and&nbsp; over 200 injuries in China. </p>
<p>According to the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), Mangkhut, this year&#8217;s 22nd typhoon, was measured with a maximum wind speed of 45 meters per second or 162 kilometers per hour when it slammed into Taishan, Guangdong. </p>
<p>Two deaths were reported in Guangdong, 15 injuries reported in Macao and at least 213 people were reported injured in Hong Kong after Mangkhut hit these regions, China Central Television reported on Sunday.&nbsp; </p>
<p>More than 2.45 million residents in Guangdong were relocated as of 5 pm on Sunday, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Schools will be closed Monday in Hong Kong, Guangdong and Hainan. </p>
<p>Obvious shaking could be felt inside buildings, Hong Kong resident Xue Juping told the Global Times on Sunday. </p>
<p>Water, electricity and internet services remain normal, Xue said. </p>
<p>Residents in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong, told the Global Times on Sunday that the price of food and water have not risen due to the local government&#8217;s emergency response system initiated days ahead of the storm.</p>
<p>Power was cut to 43,000 homes in Foshan, Guangdong two hours before the typhoon made landfall on Sunday, and 33,000 homes remain without electricity despite the company&#8217;s attempts to restore electricity, China News Service reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>China General Nuclear Power Corporation&#8217;s four nuclear power bases in southern China, which have 18 nuclear power units, are operating safely and have not been affected by the typhoon, the company said Sunday.</p>
<p>When Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge&#8217;s power supply system operated normally, and monitors showed the bridge was safe despite being battered by winds reaching 55 meters per second, the Guangdong provincial meteorological administration said.</p>
<p>Typhoon Mangkhut is expected to impact central and southern parts of Guangdong, and Hong Kong and Macau with gales measuring between force 7 and 10, on a 17-point scale. The CMA has issued a red alert, the highest of four colored alerts, according to Jiang Jianying, chief analyst with the remote sensing service center under the National Satellite Meteorological Center.</p>
<p>Mangkhut is also expected to move northwest at 30 kilometers per hour and hit South China&#8217;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Sunday night, before being downgraded to tropical depression by early Tuesday as it approaches Southwest China&#8217;s Yunnan Province, Jiang told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s good reason Typhoon Mangkhut has been labeled this year&#8217;s king of storms. Its cloud cover is some 1,355 kilometers in diameter, almost twice the size of Hurricane Florence which hit the US on Friday, Han Xiuzhen, a meteorological expert with the CMA, told the Global Times on Sunday. </p>
<p>Travel restricted</p>
<p>Government authorities in the areas affected in China have taken precautions ahead of the destructive storm&#8217;s arrival.</p>
<p>More than 400 flights at two airports in South China&#8217;s Hainan Province were canceled Sunday morning, with all coastal resorts and schools closed, Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
<p>More than 200 flights to Guangdong, Hainan and other regions in southern China were canceled at the Beijing Capital International Airport on Sunday. </p>
<p>Also, on Saturday, fishing boats in coastal cities of Guangdong were called into harbor. Ferry services in the Qiongzhou Strait linking Guangdong and Hainan were suspended from Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Flights via Shenzhen airport were all canceled on Sunday until 8 am Monday. All long-distance bus services through the city were suspended from 6 pm Saturday.</p>
<p>The Macao government also announced on Saturday that it has shut down all casinos in the region, the first time in history.</p>

<p>China should scrap outdoor trials as they severely violate dignity and antagonize naysayers and judicial authorities, a lawmaker suggested at the ongoing session of China&#8217;s top legislature.</p>
<p>Public trial and shame parades not only break the law, but also violate people&#8217;s dignity,&nbsp; Shang Lunsheng, a lawyer and also a deputy to the 13th National People&#8217;s Congress, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>According to China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure Law, death sentences should be announced but not held in public.</p>
<p>In some places, a public trial is defended as a method to educate the public and showcase the government&#8217;s hard line against illegal activities.</p>
<p>In December, 12 people stood trial in front of thousands at two open-air courts: Shanwei Intermediate People&#8217;s Court and Lufeng People&#8217;s Court in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province. </p>
<p>Suspects charged with drug dealing and murder had their trials held at a sports stadium in the city of Lufeng. </p>
<p>Video clips posted by The Beijing News on its official Weibo account showed each accused suspect being paraded into the stadium in Donghai township in the back of a modified Lufeng police pickup truck, surrounded by four armed police officers.</p>
<p>At crucial times in gang crime crackdown campaigns, such practices may return to many cities and cause concern for the public, Shang said.</p>

<p>Top Chinese political advisers urged Wednesday a law to regulate collecting, using and trading personal data to secure people&#8217;s legal rights in a proposal on big data management which was submitted at the ongoing two sessions.</p>
<p>Raising people&#8217;s awareness of their rights over personal data will play a key role in improving China&#8217;s ability to protect and manage big data in the new era, Chinese experts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The proposal was submitted by the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang at the first session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this year, propelling the establishment of a reformed management system over the collection, use and sharing of big data with a focus on both protection and utilization, the news site thepaper.cn reported Wednesday. </p>
<p>The proposal states that China should encourage data trading, accelerate data circulation and popularize the data sharing spirit, stressing that only when big data applications become trans-industrial and highly used that they could contribute more. </p>
<p>It is an up-to-date and timely proposal, while somehow overlooking some dire needs in Chinese society when it comes to the use and protection of big data, said Li Yi, a senior research fellow at the Internet Research Center under the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s online population reached 772 million in January, with 753 million Chinese now using mobile phones to go online, the Xinhua News Agency reported. </p>
<p>Li said that it should raise private rights awareness among the Chinese people, as the majority do not realize they are actually the big data assets suppliers and creators. </p>
<p>There is also an asymmetrical relationship between the general users and big internet firms in China, and the latter enjoys a monopoly in dealing and making money using the users&#8217; data, explained the expert, while noting that both the country and the people should discuss how to benefit people in big data transactions, which is the core of the genuine big data protection. </p>
<p>China started to build a social credit system in 2014 and an open national credit information online platform is already in place, according to Xinhua. Western media believe the system is a violation of human rights by collecting personal data.</p>
<p>Essentially, the system has nothing to do with human rights infringement at all, but uses big data technology to protect the public interests in a necessary and sensible way, Li noted. </p>

<p>While virtual reality (VR) technology may be most used at home or museums, it could also help lawyers and judges in the courtroom to get a better idea of how an alleged offence took place. </p>
<p>Wearing a pair of VR glasses and operating a hand set, a witness moved the simulated images of a suspected murderer and victim on the screen to replicate the crime scenes he had seen. </p>
<p>The VR technology was used at a courtroom in Beijing&#8217;s No. 1 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court Thursday. It was the first time for Beijing&#8217;s courts to use such technology in hearing a criminal case, according to the Beijing Municipal People&#8217;s Procuratorate. </p>
<p>&#8220;The defendant threatened the girl on the screen to walk to a desk with a knife, then stabbed her on the neck,&#8221; said a witness, who was the victim&#8217;s colleague. </p>
<p>In September 2017, a man stabbed a woman to death over a romantic dispute at an office in Beijing. </p>
<p>The VR technology is part of a visualization system which also includes a projection that can present evidence including texts, photos and videos. </p>
<p>&#8220;Previously, procurators presented evidence through oral accounts or PPT,&#8221; said Zhuang Wei, an officer with the Beijing Municipal People&#8217;s Procuratorate. &#8220;The new visualization system can show evidence in a more direct and transparent way.&#8221; </p>
<p>VR technology has been widely applied in China, such as in the drug rehabilitation, training and gaming industries.</p>
