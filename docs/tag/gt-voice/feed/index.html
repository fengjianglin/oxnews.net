<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A sign of the WTO on its headquarters in Geneva Photo: VCG</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Ambassador to the WTO Zhang Xiangchen made an excellent point in dismissing the latest US proposal regarding developing-country status at the fifth General Council meeting this year held on Monday and Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming that there are one or two billionaires in Antigua and Barbuda, which only has a population of 100,000, then the country would be classified as &#8220;high-income,&#8221; but it is by no means a developed country because everyone else is poor, Zhang said.</p>
<p>Whether a country is a developing one is clearly not necessarily measured by the World Bank&#8217;s &#8220;high income&#8221; standards, nor is it up to some in Washington.</p>
<p>At the heart of the US demand for an end to the special and differential treatment for countries designating themselves as developing ones is the intention of challenging China&#8217;s developing-country status and depriving it of its legitimate rights and interests under the WTO rules, regardless of whether China actually meets the standards of a developed country.</p>
<p>It is more crucial than ever for the international community to correctly understand China&#8217;s status as a developing country amid the long-time debate over how to evaluate a country&#8217;s development status. There are more than enough facts and theories that could justify why China is still a developing country and deserves special treatment corresponding to its stage of development.</p>
<p>While China&#8217;s economy has indeed made remarkable achievements, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that China is already a developed country. Generally speaking, China still lags far behind developed countries in terms of economic and social development levels. In 2018, per capita GDP in China was less than $10,000, below the world average. Meanwhile, China&#8217;s urbanization rate for its permanent resident population was 59.58 percent in 2018, while the rate in developed countries is usually around 80 percent. Moreover, there is still a large gap between urban and rural areas and among different regions in China, with prominent wealth inequalities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of the end of 2018, there were still 16.6 million people living below the national poverty line in China. No developing country has ever had such a large economic scale and influence as China, especially at a time when its per capita economic indicators are still low in all respects. This is mainly because China has a population of nearly 1.4 billion, and this large population makes the Chinese economy appear so big.</p>
<p>Although it is not uncommon to see some observers tout and compare China with some developed powers these days, the country should have a clear picture of itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China remains the largest developing country in terms of a wide range of indicators such as per capita levels, industrial structure, employment, innovation ability and balance of development, among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the process of catching up with developed countries, China will not and should not give up its due special treatment, which is the development opportunity granted to developing countries by the multilateral trade rules.</p>

<p>Is the Indian economy heading for a hard landing? The answer to the question, to some extent, will determine the trend of the broad Asian economy in the coming year.</p>
<p>China, India and Japan together generate a considerable part of Asia&#8217;s economic activity. Although Japan&#8217;s economy expanded in the third quarter at a faster-than-estimated rate of 1.8 percent, it is too early to say the economy will recover strongly in the coming year. Japan&#8217;s economy is still struggling with stubborn deflation and slow growth. It&#8217;s hard to expect Japan to become an engine of Asian economic growth in the coming year.</p>
<p>India has emerged as an Asian economic superpower in the past few years. China and India will be the key drivers of growth for the Asian economy in 2020. However, unfortunately, both economies face downward pressure.</p>
<p>Some observers forecast China&#8217;s GDP growth may fall below 6 percent next year. Even if this scenario becomes a reality, the country will still be the top contributor to Asian GDP growth in the near term. The 6-percent figure is just a psychological mark that&#8217;s of little practical significance. Growth of 6.1 percent or 5.9 percent in China makes no big difference for the Asian economy.</p>
<p>The major uncertainty for the Asian economy will come from India. The economy is at risk of a hard landing. India&#8217;s annual GDP growth fell to a shocking 4.5 percent in the third quarter. What&#8217;s next? The country&#8217;s economy is facing the toughest times since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014.</p>
<p>If the Indian economy continues to slow, market confidence in Modi&#8217;s management will be tested. The most urgent task for his administration is curbing the downturn and restoring confidence in the market.</p>
<p>Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said recently the current economic slowdown is &#8220;temporary&#8221; and a result of the ongoing trade war between the US and China, according to Indian news agency PTI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trade war may indeed be taking a toll on India&#8217;s economy, but India needs to look inward at its deep-rooted problems, instead of blaming the trade dispute between China and the US.</p>
<p>The pro-reform Modi administration did a good job in recent years in propping up the economy. Hopefully, the Modi economic miracle can continue in the coming years &#8211; otherwise, the Asian economy may be in for a bumpy road next year.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo:Xinhua</p>
<p>It has been 18 months since the US began imposing 25 percent tariffs on the first tranche of Chinese goods, and bilateral trade between the world&#8217;s two largest economies is still sliding. The General Administration of Customs showed that China&#8217;s trade with the US fell 11.1 percent year-on-year to 3.4 trillion yuan ($483 billion) in the first 11 months of this year, widening from a 10.6-percent decline in the first 10 months.</p>
<p>Even with a &#8220;phase one&#8221; trade deal, the downtrend in bilateral trade will be difficult to reverse. Meanwhile, China&#8217;s total trade actually expanded 2.4 percent year-on-year in the first 11 months, indicating that trade with the US is not irreplaceable for China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the tariff war dragged on, Chinese companies sought new suppliers from other countries and explored the sales potential of the domestic market. Their hard work explains why China&#8217;s trade with its major partners (except the US) showed marked gains during the first 11 months &#8211; enough to make up for the decline in China-US trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, in the January-November period, China&#8217;s trade with the EU, the country&#8217;s largest trading partner, jumped 7.7 percent. Trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the No.2 partner, rose 12.7 percent.</p>
<p>Some in Washington may claim that the US has finally managed to narrow its trade deficit with China, as customs data showed that China&#8217;s trade surplus with the US hit 1.88 trillion yuan in the first 11 months, narrowing 3 percent on a yearly basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is true that a trade war could affect US-China trade and reduce the US trade deficit with China to a certain extent, but as long as Americans maintain low savings, the country&#8217;s overall trade deficit won&#8217;t change. Instead, some of the deficit with China will turn into deficits with other countries like India and Vietnam.</p>
<p>As for US consumers, they are bound to bear higher costs, regardless of whether manufacturers in China stay put or move production out of China under US tariff pressure. It&#8217;s impossible for the US to benefit from such industrial transfers as virtually no price-sensitive manufacturing work will go back to America.</p>
<p>In addition, the trade war is rearranging the global supply chain by affecting the global trade environment. This development is beyond the control and expectations of the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, regarding the industrial chain in East Asia, China used to import intermediate goods from Japan and South Korea, and assemble them into finished consumer goods for export to the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, as China exports less to the US amid the trade war, it also imports less from Japan and South Korea. Customs data showed that from January to November, China&#8217;s imports from Japan fell 2.4 percent and those from South Korea dropped 12.9 percent.</p>
<p>So the rest of the world will have to restructure their industries and prepare for the reorganization of the world&#8217;s value chain as result of the US-triggered tariff war.</p>

<p>Investors are closely watching the US non-farm payrolls report for November that is scheduled to be released on Friday. However, the reading is less significant than before as an indicator of US economic activity, thanks to the prolonged trade war with China.</p>
<p>The US unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in October, and the Labor Department reported that the US economy added 128,000 jobs for the same period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some analysts have estimated that November&#8217;s non-farm payrolls will rise by 190,000, as the return of about 45,000 striking General Motors workers helped support the number. US President Donald Trump may once again brag about the US economy, with record-low unemployment rates. However, the employment picture in the US is perhaps less rosy than those figures suggest.</p>
<p>The agricultural sector is one of the hardest-hit industries in the trade war with China, but job losses in the sector aren&#8217;t reflected by the non-farm payrolls report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mix of lower employment and lower incomes is brewing in US agricultural sector. The upcoming non-farm payrolls report isn&#8217;t a good window on the impact of the trade war on the employment picture in the US.</p>
<p>More importantly, the non-farm payrolls report cannot reflect changes in the employment structure. The Voice of America (VOA) has reported that jobs for middle-class Americans continue to shrink, though positions at the top and bottom of the pay scale are growing. The US economy indeed keeps adding jobs, but the quality of those jobs is declining. The VOA report said the fastest-growing segment of the job market for non-university-educated workers is in personal care and services occupations. Even if there&#8217;s a rapid increase in November&#8217;s non-farm payrolls figure, this can hardly be taken as evidence that the economy will gain steam rather than lose its luster.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to calculate the impact of the trade war on the US jobs market, especially jobs in the manufacturing sector. Economic indicators released recently showed that the US manufacturing sector contracted for four months as of November as the trade war took a toll on US factories. While the manufacturing sector keeps shrinking, there are also fewer US manufacturing jobs than expected.</p>
<p>The trade war and tariffs will do more harm than good in driving job creation in the US. The non-farm payrolls report is always one of the most eagerly awaited economic indicators offering a window to observe the world&#8217;s largest economy, but now it is less significant. Amid the trade war, we need a new index to observe the US job markets.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The logo of China&#8217;s tech giant Huawei. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>It seems that Huawei faces an endless list of tests, with the latest media report suggesting that the Trump administration may go further to place the Chinese technology giant on its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, restraining its access to the US financial system.</p>
<p>If this sanction is really imposed on Huawei, which has a massive trading network, then from the perspective of US-China relations and the global financial chain, it would mean a substantial decoupling between the world&#8217;s two largest economies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global industrial chain would be restructured as a result, with both Chinese and American companies suffering.</p>
<p>Financial sanctions on Huawei may only be a possibility at present, but the mere existence of such possibility is already bound to trigger more difficulties and challenges for the Chinese company, because other institutions may reduce or end doing business with it due to fear of being implicated.</p>
<p>Though Huawei may have foreseen the most serious sanctions coming its way and made relevant preparations, the impact will still inevitably be huge. Unlike general economic sanctions that have a certain impact on trade, financial sanctions target the foundation of global trade &#8211; payments and settlements, which usually inflict devastating damage on a company or a country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deterrent power of American financial sanctions comes from US financial hegemony, which is hard to shake in the short term. Financial hegemony is such a powerful weapon that the US will unlikely keep it only for Huawei, so there&#8217;s a high possibility that other Chinese companies or banks could become future targets.</p>
<p>It is essential for China to be prepared to guard against different levels of financial sanctions from the US. First, Chinese authorities need to protect relevant institutions and companies from being involved in any incidents or trouble that may escalate and lead to financial sanctions.</p>
<p>Second, China needs to speed up the establishment of a new settlement system for global trade or join forces with some European countries on this issue. For instance, after six EU countries declared that they would join the INSTEX mechanism for trade with Iran, China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Tuesday that China hopes the mechanism could soon cover more areas and open up to non-EU countries as third parties.</p>
<p>Third, the abuse of dollar-based financial hegemony has actually accelerated the de-dollarization process. During this process, China should continue its push for the yuan&#8217;s internationalization. When it comes to trade and investment where China has bargaining power, it should encourage more use of yuan-denominated pricing and settlement.</p>
<p>Fourth, the technological revolution may help expand China&#8217;s influence on global payment and monetary systems. This is why the Chinese central bank is making all-out efforts to roll out its own digital currency electronic payment system, with the aim of becoming a bellwether in cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A woman tastes wine during the 11th &#8220;Vinifest&#8221; Wine Festival in Beirut, Lebanon, on Oct. 3, 2018.

<p>It seems that US President Donald Trump couldn&#8217;t wait to open new battlefronts in the global trade war in an aim to lift the country&#8217;s slowing economy. Trump tweeted on Monday that he would restore steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina due to their currency depreciations. The same day also saw the administration threaten tariffs as high as 100 percent on up to $2.4 billion worth of French products as a retaliation against France&#8217;s digital tax.</p>
<p>The president may sincerely think that waving a tariff stick can win more benefits for American people, but he is likely to inflict more damage on the US economy in the process of destabilizing the system of global trade.</p>
<p>Using tariffs as a weapon is a terrible way to achieve any trade or political goal. It is not the first time for the president to initiate a tariff war against its trading partners in the name of protecting national interests, which usually ended up with outcomes like increased prices, hindered growth, and a heavier burden on taxpayers in the US.</p>
<p>As showed by the China-US trade war, tariffs didn&#8217;t bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, although some manufacturers did leave China for Southeast Asian countries. According to the Institute for Supply Management, US manufacturing actually slipped for the fourth consecutive month in November, with new orders, production and hiring all dropping.</p>
<p>Under WTO rules, a country is allowed to use tariffs when its interests are seriously hurt, but that shouldn&#8217;t be the excuse for the abuse of tariffs over any trade fight. For decades, the US government made great efforts to build a US-oriented global trade system, but now by introducing a flurry of protectionist measures, the US itself is tearing a hole in the old trade system by giving other countries the excuse to do the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of making a better deal through imposing tariffs is misguided, and it will only isolate the US from its trading partners and encourage retaliation instead of doing any good to its economy. In recent years, America&#8217;s lead in unilateralism has already upset and angered many of its allies, weakening the united front of the US-centered trade system. Some allies like Japan tried to establish their own trade network by signing free trade agreements with their trading partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, Japan and the EU signed a free trade agreement last year, which came into force as of February 1, 2019. Japan has also ratified the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement signed by 11 countries including several US allies.</p>
<p>The Trump administration may think it is able to rebuild a US-centered web of trade agreements in the future, but the question is whether it will be as dominant as it once was in the new system.</p>

<p>Considering China&#8217;s dominance in the rare-earth sector, any move by the Chinese government involving these coveted minerals could lead to all sorts of interpretations.</p>
<p>According to a recent statement from the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/6.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a>, China raised its annual rare-earth mining quota to 132,000 tons, 10 percent more than last year&#8217;s level and a new record high.</p>
<p>While the move alleviates concerns that China, the world&#8217;s largest supplier of rare-earth minerals, may cut supplies, some critics believe that by raising the quota, China has actually made it more difficult for the US and other countries to develop their own rare-earth industries. The importance and strategic significance of rare earths is self-evident, but it should be made clear that China is not trying to contain the rare-earth industry of any country with its advantageous position. Unlike the US, China never resorts to containment as its strategy to any potential competition.</p>
<p>It is no secret that the excessive reliance of the US on China&#8217;s rare-earth supplies is a form of leverage that China has in the trade war with the US. China controls at least 85 percent of the world&#8217;s rare-earth processing capacity, according to research firm Adamas Intelligence. Over the years, the US sourced about 80 percent of its rare-earth imports from China. China may not need to play the rare-earth card for the time being, but it is still essential to keep vigilant and to ensure the deterrent effect of this crucial bargaining chip.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the US-China trade war broke out that the West realized that rare earths would be used as a countering weapon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the pressure of a possible rare-earth fight with China, the US has been busy diversifying its rare-earth supplies away from China this year. Media reports indicated that the US had talks with some rare-earth mines in Africa, and just last week, US and Australian officials agreed to formalize a partnership to boost supply of rare earths from outside China.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s never too late for a person to start all over again, it may be too late for the US to catch up with China in the rare-earth sector, an effort that is expected to face great difficulties and challenges, including but not limited to China&#8217;s dominant influence in the industry.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it is not just pricing or quantity that gives China its grip on the rare-earth supply chain. Over the decades, China has paid great environmental costs and spent heavily in developing a clean and efficient rare-earth processing technology system. Such technological advantage is the key behind China&#8217;s leading position in the global rare-earth market.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s determination to become a bellwether in digital currencies has never been clearer given its all-out efforts.</p>
<p>Last week, Chinese financial regulators announced plans to wage a new crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges operating illegally in the country, warning of the rising speculative risks associated with the illegal trading of virtual currencies. The development ramped up pressure on bitcoin, which slumped to a six-month low on Friday.</p>
<p>If anything, the move highlighted the Chinese government&#8217;s seriousness about the digital currency that the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBC), the country&#8217;s central bank, is about to roll out &#8211; its own digital currency electronic payment (DC/EP) system. In that sense, China&#8217;s strengthened regulation of the digital currency market is not only aimed at preparing a good market environment for the launch of the state-run digital currency, it is also meant to lay a solid foundation for the competitiveness of its own digital currency.</p>
<p>So far, China&#8217;s widely anticipated digital currency, backed by the central bank, already has almost everything essential for being at the forefront of the world and ensuring its smooth development. In terms of technology, the PBC has attached great importance to digital currency research over the past five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of early August, the PBC had applied for 74 patents involved with the DC/EP project to the National Intellectual Property Administration, according to data from the central bank.</p>
<p>Moreover, China is marching toward a cashless society, with proximity mobile payment users growing by 10 percent in 2019 to reach 577.4 million, the largest in the world, according to research firm eMarketer.</p>
<p>Yet, the most crucial advantage is ought to be the explicit support to the development of digital currency from regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the legitimacy of Facebook&#8217;s Libra is still hotly debated in the US and elsewhere in the world, China&#8217;s central bank is nearly ready to launch its own cryptocurrency. Chinese regulators have been taking measures to rectify illegal trading and speculation of virtual currencies in the country, thus ensuring a good market environment for the smooth development of the new digital currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To a certain extent, how China will improve its national competitiveness will depend on its financial capability. Digital currency, together with the opening-up and management of financial markets, will be at the core of China&#8217;s financial capability in the years to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developing our own representative digital currency and becoming a bellwether in the global digital currency field is of strategic importance to China&#8217;s future influence on the global payment and monetary system, especially at a time when US financial hegemony persists.</p>
