<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Tuesday expressed concern over the involvement of students in illegal activities amid social unrest that has lasted for six months.</p>
<p>At a press briefing in the morning, Lam said she had asked schools to prevent their students from participating in illegal activities and follow the notice sent by the Education Bureau at the end of last month.</p>
<p>The police have arrested 6,022 people for offenses including unlawful assembly, participation in riot and possession of offensive weapons, among others, since June 9. Among them, 2,393 people or about 40 percent are students, and about 300 high schools in Hong Kong were involved.</p>
<p>Of the 12 people arrested on Monday morning, six were students and one was a teacher. Police seized flammable liquid and glass bottles, which could be used to make petrol bombs, and instruments for road blockage and vandalism, including nails, electric drills, homemade barricades for puncturing tires.</p>
<p>Lam said she had asked the secretary for education to seriously follow up the case of the teacher under arrest.</p>
<p>Two home-made remote-controlled bombs were found inside the campus of Wah Yan College, Wan Chai on Monday and were later defused by the police. The bombs were fully functional and may cause multiple casualties, according to the police.</p>

<br />The Hong Kong police said they seized on Sunday morning a semi-automatic pistol, 105 bullets and other prohibited weapons suspected to be used by radicals in a demonstration held in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Senior Superintendent Li Kwai-wah of Organized Crime and Triad Bureau said it is the first time that a handgun has been seized related to Hong Kong&#8217;s demonstrations in recent months, and warned organizers and participants of Sunday&#8217;s demonstration to watch out for personal and public safety.</p>
<p>The police received information suggesting that some members of a radical group, who had participated in an unlawful assembly on Oct. 20 and attacked the Mong Kok police station with a large number of petrol bombs, were planning to use weapons including guns to create chaos and attack the police during Sunday&#8217;s demonstration, Li said at a media briefing.</p>
<p>The police therefore mounted an operation on early Sunday morning at 11 locations in various districts of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In the Fortress Hill area on the Hong Kong Island, the police seized a 9 mm semi-automatic Glock pistol, which forensic firearm examination shows is in good condition, and five magazines, three of which were already loaded with bullets.</p>
<p>At that location the police also seized three daggers and some sabres.</p>
<p>In Heard Street in Wan Chai on the Hong Kong Island, where a suspected assembly point of the radicals is located, the police seized two bulletproof vests.</p>
<p>In Tsuen Wan, the New Territories, the police also launched a search operation and found a large amount of fireworks believed to be used for attacking police stations. Nine extendable batons and four pepper sprays were also seized.</p>
<p>Eight males and three females, aged between 20 and 63, have been arrested in the operation for offenses including possession of firearm without licence, possession of dangerous goods, possession of prohibited weapons and unlawful assembly.</p>
<p>Li said the police are investigating where the weapons come from and may make more arrests as the operation is still ongoing.</p>

<p>The number of visitor arrivals to Hong Kong has witnessed the sharpest decline in 16 years for the third quarter of 2019 over continued unrest in the region, official data showed Wednesday.</p>
<p>Only 11.9 million visitor arrivals have been recorded in Hong Kong during the July-September period, down 26 percent year on year, reversing a growing trend in the first half, according to the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p>
<p> <br />

(Xinhua/Zhu Xiang)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The number of tourist arrivals dropped further by around 40 percent year on year in October and fell 50 percent in the first half of November, said the bureau.</p>
<p>Following the decline, the average occupancy rate of hotel rooms has also fallen distinctly to 72 percent in the third quarter from 91 percent in the same period last year, it said.</p>
<p>Consequently, the unemployment rate of the consumption- and tourism-related sectors such as retail, accommodation and food services increased from 3.9 percent in the second quarter to 5 percent in August to October, the highest level since early 2017.</p>

(Xinhua/Zhu Xiang)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />Compared with the second quarter, the number of employees in these sectors decreased by around 47,000.</p>
<p>As a pillar industry for Hong Kong, tourism employed more than 250,000 people and contributed 4.5 percent of GDP to Hong Kong&#8217;s economy in 2017.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s GDP contracted 2.9 percent year on year in the third quarter, sharply down from a 0.4-percent growth in the second quarter. Following the downward trajectory, the unemployment rate in August-October increased to 3.1 percent, official data showed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A view of Hong Kong Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) has decided to continue preparations for the upcoming<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> holiday and the spring festival, which falls in January next year, with the aim to attract more visitors to the city, but it is still too early to predict the outcome, a spokesperson told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year parade will be replaced by a four-day celebration including a carnival, food and decorations. It will run from the first day of the Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25, 2020. The HKTB is still seeking an appropriate location for the celebration, Dane Cheng, executive director of the tourism board, told the Global Times Tuesday.</p>
<p>It is the first time the parade will not be held since its launch in 1996, South China Morning Post reported Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The adjustment is a normal one, and it is not related to the ongoing unrest, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>As for the countdown activity on December 31, the HKTB has no plans to cancel it, Hong Kong news outlet mingpao.com reported on Tuesday. The authority is making full preparations, but it will put public safety first.</p>
<p>It will be difficult to revive the city&#8217;s hard-hit tourism industry in the short term due to the ongoing unrest, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>As one of Hong Kong&#8217;s core services industries, the tourism sector has been heavily affected due to the protests in the city since June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong slid by 40 percent in the first 10 days in November compared with the same period in October, according to Cheng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The board aims to gather local businesses including airlines, travel agencies, hotels, restaurants and stores to promote special offers for not only tourists but also Hongkongers and those from outside the city, said Cheng.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s tourism sector suffered a significant downturn during this year&#8217;s National Day holidays, which ran from October 1 to 7, with the number of tourist arrivals dropping roughly 50 percent year-on-year in the first six days of the seven-day holiday.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government canceled a scheduled fireworks show on October 1 due to concerns about public safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to bring the local tourism industry back to normal in a short period, although local protests have tended to scale down,&#8221; Song Ding, a research fellow at the Shenzhen-based China Development Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hopes of revitalizing Hong Kong&#8217;s tourism sector via the upcoming holidays this winter seem dim, according to Song. That effort &#8220;needs at least one or two quarters,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Even if the protests clear up, people might still lack confidence in the security situation in the city, Song noted.</p>

<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s former police chief expects newly elected district councilors to cooperate with the government and police to end the riots and restore social order, saying the election result will not affect the direction of police work in ending the riots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tang King-shing, former police commissioner of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, told the Global Times on Monday that he respects the election results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final election results were confirmed 1pm Monday. Pan-democrats won 388 seats and took control of 17 of the city&#8217;s 18 district councils, according to Hong Kong&#8217;s Cable News Channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tang said the district council&#8217;s main work is focused on people&#8217;s livelihood, such as traffic and health issues, while many so-called pan-democracy candidates have campaigned on political issues, which are beyond the scope of their work as district councilors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a little concerned about their purpose. Is it about politics or people&#8217;s livelihood?&#8221; Tang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tang said it&#8217;s difficult to say at this moment if the safety situation will improve after the election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The district council targets livelihood, and stability is what is needed most for improving people&#8217;s livelihood. Rioting is completely against livelihood,&#8221; Tang said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tang appealed to the newly elected district councilors to properly deal with problems in their districts, and cooperate with the government and police to improve public security, and not foment violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to use the district council as a platform to threaten the government,&#8221; Tang said. &#8220;The district council should be a platform for cooperation with the government, not a political platform. Otherwise, they will let the voters down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dozens of pan-democracy district councilors-elect gathered near the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Monday afternoon, expressing support for those on campus and demanding police &#8220;end the siege of the university,&#8221; Hong Kong media reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protesters have occupied the campus for a week, engaging in clashes with police. So far, around 1,000 have left the campus, with about 20 still refusing to go, according to local media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong lawyer Kennedy Wong Ying-ho told the Global Times on Monday that it&#8217;s quite worrying that some young newly elected district councilors believed their support to rioters could bring them votes and seats at district council and their behaviors had no consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;These people may create frequent frictions with the government after they take office at the district council. The lack of harmonious cooperation will ultimately make districts&#8217; livelihood projects and construction suffer,&#8221; Wong said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;These new district councilors supporting rioters at the PolyU attempted to get more political opportunities and more political benefits for themselves,&#8221; Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan affairs at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Monday. &#8220;They don&#8217;t attend to their proper duties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Li said that behaviors of these councilors are to pour oil on the fire, intensifying the conflicts and violence of the Hong Kong society. &#8220;This election cannot reflect true and rational will of the people in Hong Kong, and what the councilors did go against solving the social problem,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Tang said that the election this time was determined by political stances rather than focusing on the ability of candidates to promote district work or solve difficulties facing residents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past months, some people have reversed causes and consequences and targeted government and police actions that have been distorted in the past months, asking &#8220;why disperse those protesters or why fire tear gas,&#8221; Tang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said that the election result will have no effect on the police who are focused on ending the riots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who will do it if not the police?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Votes counting process of the 2019 Hong Kong District Council elections is yet to finish after a whole night and the final result hasn&#8217;t announced either, but current situation showed that the pan-democracy candidates won against their pro-establishment opponents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts noted the win is not an indication that voters support violence, as putting an end to the city&#8217;s chaos is still the utmost priority among Hong Kong residents, and the elections should be a turning point in ending the riots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The polling stations closed at 10:30 pm and according to the official data, voter turnout was confirmed at 71.2 percent of 4.1 million registered voters, compared to 47 percent during the 2015 polls, and surpassing the record of 58 percent set in the 2016&#8217;s Legislative Council elections, where at least 10 localist candidates were elected.</p>
<p>Among the more than 1,000 candidates fighting for 452 seats among district councils of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), about 320 are from pro-establishment parties and more than 390 from pan-democratic groups. Over 370 candidates claimed to be &#8220;independent,&#8221; while the remainder did not provide their political backgrounds.</p>
<p>At 9:15 am on Monday, the pan-democracy camp had secured 387 seats, while the pro-establishment camp had 61, according to Hong Kong-based television Cable News Channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final results are scheduled to be announced late Monday morning. The elections were the first ones held amid the ongoing social unrest that has turned increasingly violent.</p>
<p><strong>Ending violence</p>
<p></strong>The pro-establishment camp received about 41 percent of the votes, and the pan-democracy camp garnered 57 percent as of 9:15 am Monday, which means the pan-democrats&#8217; victory was not an overwhelming one.</p>
<p>Voting for pan-democratic groups does not mean voters will stand with violence, radicals and Hong Kong separatists. No matter they are pro-establishment or pan-democratic groups, ending riots and chaos remains the utmost desire shared by Hong Kong society, Tang Fei, member of the council of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The pro-establishment candidate for Tuen Men district (L20) Junius Ho said after his defeat, &#8220;This is a particular year, as we experience particular elections and have abnormal results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Observers said that after months of social unrest, the district council election is a test of public opinion and a test of social sentiment in a tough year. They noted that the public is dissatisfied with the efforts of the local government and the pro-establishment camp.</p>
<p>They also believed that this is a highly politicized and sentimental election and it remains a test for those elected pan-democratic councilors as whether their community work will override political stance and if they do not serve the people wholeheartedly, they could expect to be abandoned by electorates.</p>
<p>&#8220;The HKSAR government tends to ignore potential crises, and its governing body tends to become bureaucratic and rigid,&#8221; Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan studies at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Li noted that the public&#8217;s judgment and evaluation of the local government would be reflected in votes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The result of this district council elections shows that there are shortcomings in election tactics. The campaign of candidates was too traditional and lacks creativity and failed to win the public opinions in democratic politics. The pro-establishment camp lacks motivation and explosiveness, while oppositions can easily gain such power,&#8221; said Li.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s election was held after months of protests and ongoing social unrest which made public opinion expression highly sentimental, Li noted.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Facing future</strong></span></p>
<p>Hao Shinan, an expert at Shanghai International Studies University, who observes Hong Kong affairs, said that pro-establishment camp&#8217;s defeat was a result created by issues related to the election cycle under a special political climate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Hao explained, this does not mean the pro-establishment camp does not stand a chance to make a comeback and nor does it foreshadow the results of next year&#8217;s 2020 Hong Kong Legislative Council election.</p>
<p>The pro-establishment camp should remain calm and composed, and seek to cultivate ties at the grassroots level, which is where the party&#8217;s traditional edge lies, rather than focus on mobilization and election techniques, Hao noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HKSAR government must change its way of thinking and how it serves the public. &#8220;Real politicians should break their work routine, and become more creative and politically sensitive,&#8221; Li said.</p>
<p>On major issues, pro-establishment parties should stand firm and remain confident in expressing their views such as saying &#8220;no&#8221; to violence and supporting legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, Hao said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should also focus on rallying support from the young people to change its traditional image, Hao noted.</p>
<p>Observers noted that this election showed obvious disadvantages of the pro-establishment camp, who either can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t know how to communicate with younger residents. In the future, they should strengthen youth outreach efforts, and effectively respond to their demands, as it would bring hope to Hong Kong&#8217;s future.</p>
