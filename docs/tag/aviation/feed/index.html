<p><strong>South Africa working to sustain SAA</strong></p>
<p>The South African government is working on &#8220;immediate actions&#8221; to ensure cash-strapped South African Airways&#8217; (SAA&#8217;s) survival, the Ministry of Public Enterprises said on Wednesday, warning that the airline could not &#8220;continue as is.&#8221;</p>
<p>SAA, which hasn&#8217;t made a profit since 2011 and is dependent on government bailouts to remain solvent, suffered a crippling strike this month which pushed it to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>The airline needs to secure more than 2 billion rand ($136 million) of working capital to continue operations, but commercial banks won&#8217;t lend SAA more money without additional state guarantees.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is trying to wean ailing state firms off government support and has not yet granted those guarantees.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Public Enterprises, which oversees SAA, said it was working with SAA to enable it to continue its business. But it said, &#8220;SAA cannot continue as is,&#8221; and that further details would be provided over the next week.</p>
<p><strong>Norwegian Air cuts routes</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>Budget airline Norwegian Air is ending flights from Copenhagen and Stockholm to the US and Thailand due to weak demand and technical problems affecting the engines on its Boeing 787 Dreamliners, it said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Flights between Oslo and the US would continue, it said, while routes between Norway and Thailand were under review as part of its latest initiative to cut costs and restore profits after rapid expansion left the carrier weighed down by debt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scandinavia isn&#8217;t big enough to maintain intercontinental flights from Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen,&#8221; Matthew Wood, senior vice president for commercial operations, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Norwegian has shaken up the transatlantic travel market with low fares, challenging major transatlantic carriers such as British Airways. But its profitability has suffered.</p>
<p>To stem losses, Norwegian has cut unprofitable routes, saying last month that it would reduce capacity by 10 percent next year, the first plan to shrink in its near two-decade history.</p>
<p>Norwegian plans to use the extra cash to help cover costs resulting from the grounding of its short-haul fleet of Boeing MAX aircraft and issues with engines on its long-haul Boeing 787 Dreamliners.</p>
<p><strong>Tunisia&#8217;s state airline to axe 400 jobs</strong></p>
<p>Tunisair plans to lay off 400 of its full-time employees in 2020 as part of plans to ease financial difficulties at the state-owned Tunisian airline, its chief executive said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The national carrier&#8217;s squeezed finances have led to flight delays, declining services and the grounding of aircraft due to a lack of spare parts.</p>
<p>Tunisair has a fleet of 27 aircraft and 8,000 employees, which the government has failed to trim in the face of resistance from labor unions.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of a structural reform program, 400 employees will be laid off in 2020 in an effort to reduce the company&#8217;s high wage mass and ease its financial difficulties,&#8221; said CEO Elyess Mankabi.</p>
<p>The plan was approved by the government, he added.</p>
<p>The company has been suffering losses since the ousting of Tunisia&#8217;s autocrat President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 and faces increased competition as the country negotiates an Open Skies agreement with the European Union.</p>
<p>As part of broader reforms, Tunisia is seeking to curb losses incurred by large state-owned companies, which amounted to about $2 billion in 2018.</p>

<p>Asian airlines are cautious about the outlook for 2020 after trade disputes have undermined confidence and led to economic growth below initial forecasts this year, the head of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) said on Monday.</p>
<p>Airline passenger growth in Asia has moderated this year to around 4.4 percent in the nine months ended September 30, down from 7.7 percent for the same period in 2018, AAPA statistics show.</p>
<p>Asian cargo carriage fell 5.8 percent in the first nine months of the year amid the China-US trade war.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we need to be a little bit cautious,&#8221; AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman told Reuters of the 2020 outlook after having met Asian airline chief executives in Kuala Lumpur, capital of Malaysia.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it turns out to be a bit better than expected, then we will be ready to respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>AAPA moved the meeting to Kuala Lumpur after cancelling plans for a larger gathering in Hong Kong, citing the &#8220;unpredictability&#8221; of the situation following months of often violent protests in the Chinese city.</p>
<p>Several Asian airlines have cut flights to Hong Kong over the coming weeks as demand has fallen, which, along with the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, has made growth more challenging.</p>
<p>Herdman said he believes the capacity adjustments to Hong Kong will be reversed once the situation improves and tourists return to the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;The general feeling is Hong Kong will recover in due course,&#8221; Herdman said. &#8220;In the short term, [airlines] need to adjust to demand as they find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>AAPA on Monday announced Herdman, a former Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd executive, planned to depart in March after 15 years in his role. He will be replaced by Subhas Menon, a long-time executive at member carrier Singapore Airlines Ltd.</p>

<p>Lufthansa is in final negotiations for the sale of its LSG catering division&#8217;s European operations to Switzerland&#8217;s Gategroup, as part of plans to focus on its airline business.</p>
<p>The proposed sale announced on Tuesday comes as Lufthansa contends with low margins in a competitive market, with Lufthansa&#8217;s supervisory board expected to sign off on the deal on December 3, sources close to the matter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sale is part of Lufthansa&#8217;s new strategy to focus on its airline business,&#8221; the German carrier said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore, the sale enables the new owner to further develop the catering business.&#8221;</p>
<p>No financial details were disclosed.</p>
<p>Airline catering company Gategroup said the deal, which would be subject to regulatory approval, was still under negotiation and parties were moving forward with discussions.</p>
<p>German trade union Verdi, meanwhile, voiced its concerns over the proposed sale, first reported by Reuters earlier on Tuesday. The union reiterated that it views a sale as a strategic mistake and said it could call for a strike if demands regarding jobs and employee rights are not met.</p>
<p>Before signing a contract with Gategroup, Lufthansa must protect the wages and working conditions of LSG employees in a collective agreement, Verdi representative Katharina Wesenick told Reuters.</p>
<p>Gategroup&#8217;s offer topped that of industry rival Do&amp;Co. The two had been the last remaining contenders in a long, drawn out auction, sources familiar with the process said.</p>
<p>A Do&amp;Co representative was not available for comment.</p>
<p>Gategroup is owned by Singapore state fund Temasek and Asian investment firm RRJ Capital, who took over the company in several steps from Chinese conglomerate HNA. Gategroup operates the Gategourmet brand.</p>
<p>Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr has previously said that the airline&#8217;s catering business was being challenged by the large number of locations it serves, high staff costs and exposure to currency exchange rates.</p>
<p>The sale of LSG&#8217;s European operations will be followed by an auction for its international business, which is expected to start in the first quarter, the sources added.</p>
<p>Though price details have yet to emerge, company sources have said that Lufthansa might receive only a small sum for LSG&#8217;s European operations.</p>
<p>In its financial report, Lufthansa said it had assets held for sale worth 393 million euros ($433 million) and liabilities of 639 million euros related to the planned disposal of its European catering activities.</p>
<p>In the first six months, Lufthansa&#8217;s catering revenue increased by 4 percent to 1.6 billion euros, while earnings before interest and tax contracted by 18 percent to 33 million euros.</p>

<p>South Korea and Japan are setting aside historical grievances to redraw responsibilities for air traffic control over the East China Sea following recent near misses.</p>
<p>Responsibility in the &#8220;AKARA corridor&#8221; through South Korean airspace is currently split, with South Korean controllers shepherding north-south flights, and Japan&#8217;s directing east-west flights, many of them in and out of Shanghai.</p>
<p>But South Korean and Japanese air traffic controllers operate on different radio frequencies, making communications more difficult for pilots who may be dealing with emergency in-flight situations, or needing to change altitude to avoid turbulence or bad weather.</p>
<p>An agreement in principle has been reached for South Korea to take over Japan&#8217;s role, the United Nations aviation agency said on Wednesday night, confirming a Reuters story published earlier in the day.</p>
<p>China was included in the agreement, as its air traffic controllers currently hand over to Japanese controllers in the corridor, and will in future hand over to South Korean controllers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposal we have put forward has been accepted by the three states,&#8221; International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council President Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu said in an interview with Reuters. &#8220;The glory actually goes to the states who were able to work together to find a solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aliu said he expects the agreement to be formalized in January or February 2020 and to take effect in April.</p>
<p>The compromise comes despite decades of strained relations between Seoul and Tokyo over their wartime past, exacerbated in recent months by a simmering trade dispute. South Korean airlines have cut flights to Japan due to a plunge in passenger demand.</p>
<p>Aliu declined to comment on relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Airline trade group International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in a statement that it knows the deal &#8220;will have a positive impact on safety and efficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dangers were laid bare by two recent near misses between planes, which were blamed on conflicting air traffic control rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, two commercial aircraft flew too close to one another, and in 2018 a FedEx plane nearly collided with two Korean low-cost carrier jets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk posed by the current configuration is known, and generally well mitigated,&#8221; said one source familiar with the ICAO-led talks and the region. &#8220;However, mistakes can happen, and two errors &#8211; one in 2018 and another in 2019 &#8211; highlighted this concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additional route</p>
<p>The present arrangements were drawn up in 1983, when South Korea had no diplomatic relations with China and there were only about 10 flights a day in the corridor.</p>
<p>Since then, the corridor has become one of the busiest portions of airspace in the Asia-Pacific region, with 800 flights daily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Montreal-based ICAO recognized the urgent need to streamline traffic control, with the corridor expected to become even busier next year as Japan prepares to receive more traffic ahead of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally got concerned about the situation,&#8221; said Aliu, who was directly involved in the talks. &#8220;Because as you know, we will have the Tokyo Olympics coming and that will also mean many more flights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the new deal, Japan will benefit from an additional air route, Aliu said. A deal could lead to further additional routes, with an airway between China and Korea to be discussed after the Olympics.</p>
<p>Andrew Herdman, director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, said the prospective changes would aid capacity and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Administration of China could not be reached for comment. An official at South Korea&#8217;s Transport Ministry said earlier on Wednesday that it had raised the air traffic control issue with the ICAO and remained in negotiations with Japan.</p>
<p>An official at Japan&#8217;s Transport Ministry said his country was discussing the AKARA corridor with other countries in accordance with ICAO principles.&nbsp;</p>
