<p>Asian airlines are cautious about the outlook for 2020 after trade disputes have undermined confidence and led to economic growth below initial forecasts this year, the head of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) said on Monday.</p>
<p>Airline passenger growth in Asia has moderated this year to around 4.4 percent in the nine months ended September 30, down from 7.7 percent for the same period in 2018, AAPA statistics show.</p>
<p>Asian cargo carriage fell 5.8 percent in the first nine months of the year amid the China-US trade war.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we need to be a little bit cautious,&#8221; AAPA Director General Andrew Herdman told Reuters of the 2020 outlook after having met Asian airline chief executives in Kuala Lumpur, capital of Malaysia.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it turns out to be a bit better than expected, then we will be ready to respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>AAPA moved the meeting to Kuala Lumpur after cancelling plans for a larger gathering in Hong Kong, citing the &#8220;unpredictability&#8221; of the situation following months of often violent protests in the Chinese city.</p>
<p>Several Asian airlines have cut flights to Hong Kong over the coming weeks as demand has fallen, which, along with the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, has made growth more challenging.</p>
<p>Herdman said he believes the capacity adjustments to Hong Kong will be reversed once the situation improves and tourists return to the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;The general feeling is Hong Kong will recover in due course,&#8221; Herdman said. &#8220;In the short term, [airlines] need to adjust to demand as they find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>AAPA on Monday announced Herdman, a former Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd executive, planned to depart in March after 15 years in his role. He will be replaced by Subhas Menon, a long-time executive at member carrier Singapore Airlines Ltd.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A Lufthansa plane rolls along the runway past a Niki plane at Dusseldorf Airport, Germany, on December 1, 2017. Photo: IC</p>
<p>Lufthansa is in final negotiations for the sale of its LSG catering division&#8217;s European operations to Switzerland&#8217;s Gategroup, as part of plans to focus on its airline business.</p>
<p>The proposed sale announced on Tuesday comes as Lufthansa contends with low margins in a competitive market, with Lufthansa&#8217;s supervisory board expected to sign off on the deal on December 3, sources close to the matter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sale is part of Lufthansa&#8217;s new strategy to focus on its airline business,&#8221; the German carrier said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore, the sale enables the new owner to further develop the catering business.&#8221;</p>
<p>No financial details were disclosed.</p>
<p>Airline catering company Gategroup said the deal, which would be subject to regulatory approval, was still under negotiation and parties were moving forward with discussions.</p>
<p>German trade union Verdi, meanwhile, voiced its concerns over the proposed sale, first reported by Reuters earlier on Tuesday. The union reiterated that it views a sale as a strategic mistake and said it could call for a strike if demands regarding jobs and employee rights are not met.</p>
<p>Before signing a contract with Gategroup, Lufthansa must protect the wages and working conditions of LSG employees in a collective agreement, Verdi representative Katharina Wesenick told Reuters.</p>
<p>Gategroup&#8217;s offer topped that of industry rival Do&amp;Co. The two had been the last remaining contenders in a long, drawn out auction, sources familiar with the process said.</p>
<p>A Do&amp;Co representative was not available for comment.</p>
<p>Gategroup is owned by Singapore state fund Temasek and Asian investment firm RRJ Capital, who took over the company in several steps from Chinese conglomerate HNA. Gategroup operates the Gategourmet brand.</p>
<p>Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr has previously said that the airline&#8217;s catering business was being challenged by the large number of locations it serves, high staff costs and exposure to currency exchange rates.</p>
<p>The sale of LSG&#8217;s European operations will be followed by an auction for its international business, which is expected to start in the first quarter, the sources added.</p>
<p>Though price details have yet to emerge, company sources have said that Lufthansa might receive only a small sum for LSG&#8217;s European operations.</p>
<p>In its financial report, Lufthansa said it had assets held for sale worth 393 million euros ($433 million) and liabilities of 639 million euros related to the planned disposal of its European catering activities.</p>
<p>In the first six months, Lufthansa&#8217;s catering revenue increased by 4 percent to 1.6 billion euros, while earnings before interest and tax contracted by 18 percent to 33 million euros.</p>

<p>South Korea and Japan are setting aside historical grievances to redraw responsibilities for air traffic control over the East China Sea following recent near misses.</p>
<p>Responsibility in the &#8220;AKARA corridor&#8221; through South Korean airspace is currently split, with South Korean controllers shepherding north-south flights, and Japan&#8217;s directing east-west flights, many of them in and out of Shanghai.</p>
<p>But South Korean and Japanese air traffic controllers operate on different radio frequencies, making communications more difficult for pilots who may be dealing with emergency in-flight situations, or needing to change altitude to avoid turbulence or bad weather.</p>
<p>An agreement in principle has been reached for South Korea to take over Japan&#8217;s role, the United Nations aviation agency said on Wednesday night, confirming a Reuters story published earlier in the day.</p>
<p>China was included in the agreement, as its air traffic controllers currently hand over to Japanese controllers in the corridor, and will in future hand over to South Korean controllers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposal we have put forward has been accepted by the three states,&#8221; International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council President Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu said in an interview with Reuters. &#8220;The glory actually goes to the states who were able to work together to find a solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aliu said he expects the agreement to be formalized in January or February 2020 and to take effect in April.</p>
<p>The compromise comes despite decades of strained relations between Seoul and Tokyo over their wartime past, exacerbated in recent months by a simmering trade dispute. South Korean airlines have cut flights to Japan due to a plunge in passenger demand.</p>
<p>Aliu declined to comment on relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Airline trade group International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in a statement that it knows the deal &#8220;will have a positive impact on safety and efficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dangers were laid bare by two recent near misses between planes, which were blamed on conflicting air traffic control rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, two commercial aircraft flew too close to one another, and in 2018 a FedEx plane nearly collided with two Korean low-cost carrier jets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk posed by the current configuration is known, and generally well mitigated,&#8221; said one source familiar with the ICAO-led talks and the region. &#8220;However, mistakes can happen, and two errors &#8211; one in 2018 and another in 2019 &#8211; highlighted this concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additional route</p>
<p>The present arrangements were drawn up in 1983, when South Korea had no diplomatic relations with China and there were only about 10 flights a day in the corridor.</p>
<p>Since then, the corridor has become one of the busiest portions of airspace in the Asia-Pacific region, with 800 flights daily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Montreal-based ICAO recognized the urgent need to streamline traffic control, with the corridor expected to become even busier next year as Japan prepares to receive more traffic ahead of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally got concerned about the situation,&#8221; said Aliu, who was directly involved in the talks. &#8220;Because as you know, we will have the Tokyo Olympics coming and that will also mean many more flights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the new deal, Japan will benefit from an additional air route, Aliu said. A deal could lead to further additional routes, with an airway between China and Korea to be discussed after the Olympics.</p>
<p>Andrew Herdman, director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, said the prospective changes would aid capacity and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Administration of China could not be reached for comment. An official at South Korea&#8217;s Transport Ministry said earlier on Wednesday that it had raised the air traffic control issue with the ICAO and remained in negotiations with Japan.</p>
<p>An official at Japan&#8217;s Transport Ministry said his country was discussing the AKARA corridor with other countries in accordance with ICAO principles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s newly-opened mega airport was the most punctual medium-sized airport in the world in October, its first month of operation, according to a report released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a boost for the state-of-the-art airport&#8217;s new profile, the Beijing Daxing International Airport (BDIA) recorded an impressive on-time departure rate of 94.51 percent, the highest of any airport, the report released by Chinese civil aviation data provider VariFlight showed.</p>
<p>Th average delay time for departure from the BDIA was at 9.46 minutes.</p>
<p>The BDIA handled 2,138 departures in October, which has been categorized as a medium-sized airport, according to VariFlight.</p>
<p>Located in the south of downtown Beijing, the BDIA is designed to handle 3.5 million passengers in 2019 and 72 million passengers by 2025.</p>
<p>It went into operation in late September with much fanfare because of its advanced technologies and unique design.</p>

<p>The newly-opened Beijing Daxing International Airport (BDIA) received a flight from Finnair Monday morning, showing that the Finland-based carrier is operating in the form of &#8220;dual hubs&#8221; in Beijing &#8211; going through the two major airports of the Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) and BDIA.</p>
<p>Finnair has added three weekly frequencies to BDIA during the winter season of 2019 to 2020. In total, Finnair flies 10 weekly frequencies now.</p>
<p>With the added capacity, Finnair said it&nbsp;&nbsp;is &#8220;proud to satisfy more travel demand&#8221; between Beijing and over 100 destinations in Europe, allowing travelers short flight times and convenient transfers via Helsinki.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flying through the two airports of Beijing can help expand the carrier&#8217;s services to more regions in China, Mikko Turtiainen, vice president of global sales at Finnair, said during an interview on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daxing airport was officially put into operation on September 25, 2019. Thus far, it is the largest integrated transport hub in the world, with an area of 1.43 million square meters. Annual passenger traffic is estimated to reach 72 million by 2025, and international flights will account for 30 percent of total air traffic then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased to welcome more foreign carriers to operate here,&#8221; Kong Yue, vice president of BDIA, said on Monday.</p>
<p>Finnair has a strong commitment to and long history operating in China for a span of more than 30 years, and was the first foreign airline to announce operations at BDIA. Now, Finnair&#8217;s non-stop routes to China include those flying to Beijing, Shanghai, Xi&#8217;an, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Hong Kong, with Alipay mobile payment and Wi-Fi services provided onboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this winter season, 15 carriers are operating at BDIA. In addition to Finnair, 7 other overseas carriers will fly to BDIA , including British Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines, Royal Moroccan Airlines, Effie Airways and Himalayan Airlines.</p>
<p>Like Finnair, Polish Airlines will serve both airports in Beijing, according to BDIA.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Delta Air Lines celebrate successful move to Shanghai Pudong International Airport on October 25 Photo: Courtesy of Delta Air Lines </p>
<p>US-based Delta Air Lines has become one of the first overseas carriers to begin operations at China&#8217;s Pudong International Airport&#8217;s new satellite terminal.</p>
<p>The carrier, which is now the largest in the world in terms of revenue, held a ceremony on October 25 to mark its official relocation to S1. The move was made in a bid to improve on-time performance and ensure seamless transfers, as passengers can board all flights from the terminal directly instead of taking shuttle buses.</p>
<p>About 20 percent of Delta&#8217;s overseas passengers make transfers at Pudong, continuing on to domestic and international flights, Wong Hong, Delta&#8217;s China and Singapore president, said. &#8220;With our strategic partnership with China Eastern Airlines, we hope we can have more passengers for connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Delta currently operates four daily direct flights from Shanghai Pudong to major hub airports in the US, including those in Detroit, Seattle, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Through strategic cooperation with China Eastern Airlines, it provides passengers with more than 1,350 domestic codeshare flights per week, covering more than 40 cities in China.</p>
<p>Delta operates two direct flights to the US from Beijing every day, flying to Seattle and Detroit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To serve Chinese customers more efficiently, it is expected that in early December of this year, the direct flight route from Shanghai Pudong to Atlanta in the US will utilize the newly modified B777 aircrafts. At that time, all Delta flights from Shanghai to the US will be operated by its flagship A350 aircraft, the new A330-900neo aircraft or the retrofitted B777 passenger aircraft. All models are equipped with the next-generation Delta One Suite and Delta Premium Select seats.</p>
<p>The Beijing Daxing International Airport began operations last month. By winter, 15 carriers will be operating in the new airport, with eight from overseas including British Airways and Malaysia Airlines. Polish Airlines and Finnair will operate in both airports in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked if Delta would move to the new airport, Wong said they have not made any final decision as yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the long-term plan, we will definitely be with China Eastern Airlines. But for us, passenger transfer is also very important. If we move to the new airport, we must also consider the passenger&#8217;s transit demands,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Delta flights from the US arrive in Beijing, some passengers need to transfer to codeshare flights with China Eastern Airlines and Shanghai Airlines to other cities in China, he explained. The Daxing airport is relatively far from the Beijing Capital International Airport, so transit needs must be considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delta&#8217;s adjusted operating revenue of $12.6 billion for the September quarter improved 6.5 percent, $771 million higher than the same quarter of last year. This result marks a quarterly record for the company, driven by improvements across all Delta&#8217;s business lines, according to its fiscal report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company, however, said its Pacific revenues declined 4.6 percent during the quarter, with a 3.3 percent higher capacity and a 7.6 percent decline in unit revenues. Unit revenue performance was pressured by weaker macroeconomics, trade uncertainty and a nearly one point currency headwind.</p>
<p>Wong said that the growth rate of Delta&#8217;s flights in China this year is not as high as it was before. In the past, there had been a growth of around 15 percent every year, but this year&#8217;s growth is not as high partially due to the weak market demand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />In a bid to enhance connectivity between the two neighbors, a Nepal-China joint venture company Himalaya Airlines started the operation of direct flights from Kathmandu to the Chinese capital city Beijing from Sunday. </p>
<p>Organizing a special function at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, the company launched its maiden flight amid the presence of Nepali Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Yogesh Bhattarai and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi among others. </p>
<p>The flight marks the first-ever capital-to-capital direct connectivity between Nepal and China, giving great significance to the bilateral exchanges and cooperation of the two countries. </p>
<p>Addressing the ceremony, minister Bhattarai expressed hope that the connectivity between Beijing and Kathmandu can attract more Chinese tourists to visit Nepal. </p>
<p>&#8220;Direct flight between Beijing and Kathmandu has added a new avenue in Sino-Nepal relations. We hope more Chinese tourists would visit Nepal,&#8221; minister said. </p>
<p>Stating that the new connectivity has brought the people of two countries together, the minister shared that he is expecting half a million Chinese tourists to visit Nepal during Visit Nepal Year 2020. </p>
<p>Echoing his statement, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal said that the latest development has taken the aviation cooperation between the two countries to a new height. </p>
<p>Mentioning that China is the second largest tourism source market for Nepal, she said that Nepal has been the most preferred destination in South Asia for the Chinese tourists. </p>
<p>According to Himalaya Airlines, the new route is expected to ship over 40,000 Chinese passengers a year to Nepal for tourism and business cooperation. The airlines will operate three flights a week from Kathmandu&#8217;s Tribhuvan International Airport to Daxing International Airport in Beijing. </p>
<p>&#8220;The opening of this route will further facilitate the commuting of individual passengers and provide more efficient and convenient trade options for government officials, corporate personnel and businessmen of the two countries, &#8221; the company president Zhou Enyoung said. </p>
<p>The airlines said that they will soon be launching direct air service to other Chinese cities including Changsha and Shenzhen in the future. </p>
<p>Himalaya Airlines was established in August 2014. Having started with one aircraft and one destination, the airlines has progressively moved its way to three A320 and five international destinations in a span of three years. </span></p>

<p>China Eastern Airlines conducted the first international flight from Beijing&#8217;s new mega airport, the Beijing Daxing International Airport (BDIA), with a flight to Fukuoka, Japan on Sunday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As the new winter season approaches, the facility, which has only been open for one month, is welcoming more carriers to transfer flights.</p>
<p>China Eastern and China United Airlines will together operate 153 flights per day, accounting for 50 percent of the total at the new airport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those carriers will have the largest flight capacity in the new season.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will first transfer 10 percent of our capacity from Beijing Capital International Airport, including four international flights. Next year we will shift more flights here,&#8221; Liu Hao, vice general manager of the Beijing branch of China Eastern Airlines, told the Global Times on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The carrier plans to move 80 percent of its Beijing-based flights to Daxing by March 2021, making the hub the core of SkyTeam in Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another first for Daxing came on Sunday, as private carrier Juneyao Air left Shanghai headed for Beijing, the start of its services at the new airport. The carrier will fly three round trips a day between Beijing and Shanghai, with about 1,700 seats available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this winter season, there will be 15 carriers operating at Daxing, including eight from overseas carriers such as British Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines, Royal Moroccan Airlines, Effie Airways and Himalayan Airlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Polish Airlines and Finnair will serve both airports in Beijing, according to BDIA.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">The KLM miniature houses on display at the 100th anniversary celebration held in Shanghai on October 19. </p>
<p>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is in the process of applying for a slot in Beijing&#8217;s new airport, and it hopes to operate from next summer, Pieter Elbers, president and CEO of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, said recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope we can fly in two airports in Beijing,&#8221; he said at the airline&#8217;s 100th anniversary celebration held in Shanghai on October 19.</p>
<p>The two airports in the capital are the Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) and the Beijing Daxing International Airport, which began operations at the end of September this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>KLM currently operates a daily flight to Amsterdam from BCIA.</p>
<p>KLM began its direct flight to Beijing in 1996 and to Shanghai in 1999, and has since expanded its reach to more second-tier cities such as Chengdu, Hangzhou and Xiamen. 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of its Shanghai-Amsterdam route.</p>
<p>KLM is not alone in seeking a slot at the new Daxing airport, as several more international carries will join domestic airlines operating there.</p>
<p>From Sunday, a number of domestic and foreign airlines will be transferred to, or enter, the new airport. The total number of airlines operating in Daxing will then reach 15, including eight from overseas countries, such as British Airways, Malaysia Airlines and Royal Brunei Airlines.</p>
<p>Two additional foreign airlines, Polish Airlines and Finnair, will operate simultaneously at Beijing&#8217;s two airports, and KLM hopes to follow.</p>
<p>Throughout the winter season this year, the new airport is expected to open 119 routes, including 104 domestic routes and covering 118 destinations worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Expansion</strong></span></p>
<p></strong>KLM&#8217;s potential expansion marks a development in the China-Europe aviation market, as Europe is one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travelers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data from the China Tourism Academy showed that in 2018, more than 6 million Chinese people traveled to Europe, making it the second-largest destination for Chinese tourists, second only to Asia. The China-Europe route market has maintained rapid growth.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, the average number of monthly flights between China and Europe has increased from 1,300 to 2,600, and the number of routes has increased from 30 to 76, data from global consultancy firm Roland Berger showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, there were 9 Chinese and 21 foreign airlines operating direct flights to Europe from China, Ma Congxian, vice president of Air China, said in May last year, according to a report from news portal jiemian.com.</p>
<p>Juneyao Airlines in June made its first flight from Shanghai to Helsinki in Finland, and became the first private Chinese airline to operate long-haul, wide-body aircraft.</p>
<p>However, the issue of excess capacity in the second-tier-city intercontinental market has always existed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, European demand for flights to second-tier Chinese cities was not very high. But in the last two years, European passengers traveling to Chengdu, Hangzhou and Xiamen are rising steadily in number, Elbers said, adding that KLM passengers can transfer from Xiamen, Chengdu and other airports to more Chinese destinations, in cooperation with Chinese airlines.</p>
<p>&#8220;China has become one of KLM&#8217;s most important markets, and is the second-largest overseas market after the US, and the largest market in Asia,&#8221; Elbers said.</p>
<p>When asked if KLM had any plan to open routes to new destinations in China, he replied that the airline&#8217;s current job is focusing on its present network.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Code sharing</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p></strong>In 1996, KLM launched its code-sharing cooperation with China Southern Airlines, a member of the SkyTeam Alliance, on the route from Amsterdam to Beijing. It later expanded this to more routes.</p>
<p>However, China Southern left the SkyTeam Alliance in late 2018.</p>
<p>When asked if its departure from the alliance would hurt the cooperation between the two carriers, Elbers said that they would maintain their code-sharing relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, China Southern Airlines has a daily direct flight to Amsterdam from Beijing and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>KLM has carried out code sharing cooperation with Xiamen Airlines from 2012. In July 2015, with the support of KLM, Xiamen Airlines opened its Xiamen-Amsterdam route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On October 16, China Eastern announced its intention to enter into a joint venture with Virgin Atlantic, Air France and KLM, providing more valuable and attractive joint commercial propositions for customers traveling between Europe and China.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strengthened cooperation will offer increased customer benefits including more travel options and optimized connectivity across Europe and China, further facilitated by a developed joint network, as well as competitive joint commercial propositions, according to a note China Eastern sent to the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insiders said that at present, competition in the aviation market between China and Europe has gradually begun to emerge from its early chaos, and that a group-based competition trend based on aviation alliances and airline business cooperation has slowly formed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The representative office of China Southern Airlines on Monday presented its international air routes in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. </p>
<p>&#8220;In recent years, China Southern Airlines has set a task to connect the world and create a better life and accelerated the construction of a world-class air transport company,&#8221; said Zhong Bin, deputy head of the marketing department of the airlines&#8217; branch in northwest China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uygur Autonomous Region. </p>
<p>In his keynote speech during the presentation, Zhong said that China Southern Airlines, as one of China&#8217;s three major air transport companies and the largest airline in Asia, is an active participant in the implementation of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative. </p>
<p>The company has opened 172 routes in 68 cities of 38 countries located along the Belt and Road route and carries more than 15 million passengers annually, according to Zhong. </p>
<p>Besides, he said that the company has expanded strategic and business relations with international partners such as American Airlines, Emirates Airlines and Finnair. </p>
<p>In recent years, bilateral trade between China and Kyrgyzstan has reached a new level, and China&#8217;s investment in Kyrgyzstan has also made a new breakthrough, according to Li Yue, adviser on trade and economic issues of the Chinese Embassy in the Kyrgyz Republic. </p>
<p>&#8220;The aviation industry serves as an engine for the development of relations between the two countries, providing strong guarantees and support for Chinese-Kyrgyz relations and trade and economic cooperation,&#8221; Li said. </p>
<p>He said that the company has been an important part of Chinese businesses in Kyrgyzstan since the Urumqi-Bishkek route was opened in 1998, and has since then developed multiple routes. </p>
<p>For his part, Director of the Civil Aviation Agency of Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Akyshev praised China Southern Airlines as one of the best airlines in Kyrgyzstan. </p>
<p>He said that the company has been promoting close cooperation between Chinese and Kyrgyz personnel for many years with its professional and high-quality service.</p>
