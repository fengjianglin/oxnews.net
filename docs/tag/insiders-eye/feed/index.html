<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo taken on Dec. 10, 2019 shows a general view of the Syntagma Square decorated for the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> season in Athens, Greece.

<p>Just Eat shareholders are limbering up for a feast this Christmas as two suitors prepare rival menus to win over the UK food-delivery company.</p>
<p>In one corner of the kitchen is tech giant Prosus. The Amsterdam-listed group on Monday sweetened its all-cash offer to 740 pence ($9.59) per share, valuing Just Eat at 5.1 billion pounds ($6.7 billion). The new offer is just 4.2 percent better than its opening bid in October. But it still has the advantage of being higher than an all-share proposal from Takeaway.com. Based on the Dutch group&#8217;s share price on Monday morning, its bid is currently worth 691 pence per Just Eat share.</p>
<p>The two competing chefs have contrasting styles. Prosus boss Bob van Dijk warns that Just Eat faces slowing growth in the UK &#8211; which brings in half the company&#8217;s revenue &#8211; and pressure from rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats. Retooling the business will be expensive and is best done away from the scrutiny of public markets.&nbsp; By contrast, Takeaway.com Chief Executive Jitse Groen talks of giving shareholders a stake in a larger group. Just Eat&#8217;s board has so far sided with him, recommending that shareholders accept the Takeaway.com offer as it would create the largest food-delivery firm outside China.</p>
<p>The latest serving is unlikely to be the final helping. Just Eat shares were trading at 780 pence on Monday, well above Prosus&#8217; raised offer. That suggests investors are expecting the food fight to continue. Cat Rock Capital, which owns about 3 percent of Just Eat, said that Prosus&#8217; new offer continues to &#8220;dramatically undervalue&#8221; the company. The final course looks set to be served around Christmas, as the current deadline for both bidders to submit their final offers is set to be December 27. That means Takeaway.com probably needs to cook up a new offer. The Dutch group is already proposing to hand over more than half the company to Just Eat shareholders. Further improving those terms would risk knocking its own share price, undermining the benefits of the move. An alternative would be to find an outside investor to help it garnish the bid with some cash.</p>
<p>With just over two weeks to go, the pressure is on both bidders to come up with a more compelling Christmas gift.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A Saudi Aramco plant Photo: IC</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia&#8217;s sale of its crown jewel always risked becoming a Greek tragedy. Ever since the Gulf Kingdom in 2016 decided on a public stock offering to sell 5 percent of Saudi Aramco, its main source of revenue and the world&#8217;s biggest oil producer, the interests of the seller and the anticipated horde of international investors have been on a collision course. A crash duly ensued.</p>
<p>Aramco&#8217;s ill-starred listing has been through four distinct stages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The genesis of the current strife came in 2017 when Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, insisted on a $2 trillion price tag for Aramco and had investment banks and exchanges around the world competing to make that happen.</p>
<p>That led to stasis, as the difficulties of achieving such a valuation and accommodating Aramco&#8217;s myriad environmental, social and governance headaches on a global bourse became clear. In mid-2018, things went quiet.</p>
<p>Bin Salman should have waited. Instead, he displayed hubris. Saudi overhauled Aramco&#8217;s leadership in September and then revived its IPO, despite a drone and missile strike &#8211; reported by Reuters to have been planned by Iran &#8211; that knocked out half its oil output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The predictable result was a sort of nemesis. Aramco slashed its price to $1.7 trillion and, after foreign investors largely held back, cut the size of its offering from 3 percent to 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>Reuters has been covering all the twists and turns of Aramco&#8217;s tortuous journey. That&#8217;s encompassed our own stab at a discounted cash-flow valuation, ongoing probes into where the company could conceivably list, and the masochistic experiences of foreign bankers, sentenced to months of Saturday flights to Aramco headquarters in Dhahran for a demanding client with little hope of fat fees.</p>
<p>Aramco got its deal away, with at least some non-Saudi interest and a book that in the end attracted 4.7 times the amount on offer. But the sale has come at the cost of leveraging its own citizens, companies and neighbors. That could end badly. Either way, Bin Salman&#8217;s Vision 2030 program to diversify the kingdom away from oil has had an imperfect beginning.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The Uber App is seen on an iPhone. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Solving an ugly problem requires admitting there is one in the first place. Uber Technologies on Thursday released data on the number of sexual assaults, fatal attacks and the like in the course of 2.3 billion US rides taken in 2017-18. A tally of thousands for such events is shocking. But the fact that the car-hailing firm is publishing its record can only help make Uber safer.</p>
<p>Over two years, the data shows that more than 6,000 sex-related assaults were reported and 19 fatalities occurred. By comparison, Uber says the New York Police Department received more than 1,100 complaints of sex offenses in the transit system from 2017-18. It&#8217;s hard to know how to interpret that, with 3.4 billion subway rides alone over the period reported by the city&#8217;s transit authority.</p>
<p>Credit Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi noted that reactions would range from surprise at the rarity of incidents to outrage at their frequency, and from praise for Uber&#8217;s efforts to raising brickbats. &#8220;They will all be right,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Publication could, for instance, prompt more consumers to file lawsuits over the company&#8217;s lapses. Rival Lyft, which is planning to issue its own safety report, is already embroiled in a lawsuit filed by several women claiming the firm ignored sexual-assault complaints.</p>
<p>Uber has a checkered history when it comes to the harassment of women within its corporate ranks. This is one reason Khosrowshahi was brought in to replace former boss Travis Kalanick. The firm has regularly been accused of lax background requirements for drivers, and a loophole allowing unvetted users to pretend to be approved drivers was one reason London recently declined to renew the company&#8217;s license, pending an appeal by Uber.</p>
<p>For all the ambiguities, though, Uber&#8217;s report achieves at least two things. First, it should force rivals to be more transparent. And it ensures the company is motivated to reduce the incidence of crime &#8211; as it did from 2017 to 2018 &#8211; by tightening background checks, adding security measures and providing training. Ideally Uber should aim for no sexual assaults or deaths. That&#8217;s beyond what&#8217;s possible, but measuring the challenge is one way to credibly tackle it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">File photo: VCG</p>
<p><em></em>Moncler offers a costly cure for Kering&#8217;s Gucci addiction. The French fashion conglomerate may be considering a bid for the 11 billion euro ($12 billion) luxury outwear company run by Remo Ruffini. That would reduce its dependence on its largest brand, but extracting value would be hard.</p>
<p>Coming on the heels of LVMH&#8217;s $16 billion purchase of Tiffany &amp; Co, a marriage of 68 billion euro Kering and the maker of $1,000 or more puffer jackets would continue the wave of dealmaking gripping the bling universe. The two have held preliminary discussions about a combination, Bloomberg said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>For Kering, diversifying away from Gucci makes sense. The Italian brand&#8217;s boom under Alessandro Michele means it accounts for some three-quarters of the French group&#8217;s EBITDA. A recent cooling of Gucci&#8217;s stellar growth, has put pressure on Chairman and CEO Francois-Henri Pinault to expand Kering&#8217;s portfolio of brands.</p>
<p>A takeover would not come cheap. Under the leadership of top shareholder and CEO Ruffini, Moncler has emerged a runaway Italian fashion success story, doubling revenue since 2014. Ruffini may be reluctant to let go of his creature.</p>
<p>Assume Kering pays a standard 30 percent premium to Moncler&#8217;s undisturbed share price, and its outlay would be just above 12 billion euros, once cash of around 400 million euros is taken out. Analysts expect Moncler to make 775 million euros of operating profit in 2023. Take off tax, and the return on investment is nearly 5 percent, not enough to cover Moncler&#8217;s cost of capital, which Morningstar reckons is 8.9 percent.</p>
<p>To make the acquisition work, Kering would have to boost Moncler&#8217;s revenue by at least 20 percent a year until 2025, and raise its operating margin to 32 percent from around 30 percent currently, according to a Breakingviews calculation. That&#8217;s hard. There are probably few synergies between the two companies. And, while Moncler&#8217;s revenue rose nearly 20 percent last year, analysts expect growth to fall to half that level in coming years, Refinitiv data shows. The Italian sportswear maker was hit hard by the Hong Kong disruptions, and its growth may have peaked.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A man walks past a Google logo. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The reshuffle of chief executives at Google and its parent Alphabet is something of a solution in search of a problem. Sundar Pichai, who runs the search engine, will now also lead the $890 billion Alphabet, replacing Larry Page. Page&#8217;s fellow co-founder Sergey Brin will step back too, according to Tuesday&#8217;s announcement. But an overriding reason for the change is elusive.</p>
<p>Establishing Alphabet as a holding company in 2015 was a head-scratcher anyway. The idea was to have various units &#8211; from Google to self-driving division Waymo &#8211; operate independently. Page became CEO of the parent firm while Brin became president and Pichai was put in charge at Google.</p>
<p>Part of the rationale was to allow Alphabet&#8217;s so-called &#8220;other bets&#8221; to flourish. But they were really the co-founders&#8217; pet projects, and their revenue was and remains a fraction of Google&#8217;s advertising machine which includes YouTube. In the third quarter, non-Google sales amounted to just 0.3 percent of Alphabet&#8217;s total $40.5 billion.</p>
<p>Perhaps the partial reversal is a recognition that the other bets haven&#8217;t yet taken off &#8211; and the fact that Brin and Page were already taking a back seat, although they retain a lot of influence through their super-voting shares. Their willingness to cede to Pichai, just like their acceptance of Eric Schmidt as adult supervision earlier in their company&#8217;s life, is also sensible.</p>
<p>Alphabet said the move simplifies the management structure. It certainly reflects reality: Pichai is already the most high-profile public face of the company, a role that will become increasingly important amid regulatory scrutiny in Washington and Brussels. He testified before Congress a year ago.</p>
<p>The shift will probably spare the two co-founders any future demands to show up in person. It also frees them to focus more on other projects both within and outside Alphabet. For example, Page is a backer of space-mining firm Planetary Resources.</p>
<p>As for Pichai, he gets a promotion and will now explicitly run the world&#8217;s third-most valuable public company. There&#8217;s a lot to be said for succession steps that elicit little more than a shrug from investors.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A cheese maker cuts a piece of cheese during the week-long South African Cheese Festival which kicked off Friday in Stellenbosch near Cape Town, South Africa, on April 27, 2018. (Xinhua/Amando Herdade)</p>
<p>Roquefort producers are just one casualty in the brewing Franco-US cheese war of 2020. The conflagration&#8217;s abiding and potentially more economically damaging effect will be to impede a set of global reforms to the way countries tax large technology businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump&#8217;s trade body said late on Monday that it may apply 100 percent duties to $2.4 billion worth of French-made goods, including champagne, Roquefort and about 20 other types of cheese products. His beef is that President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> in July introduced a 3 percent levy on digital revenue generated in France, which Trump reckons unfairly targets US companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has a point. The French law applies to sales generated by &#8220;digital interface&#8221; services and &#8220;targeted advertising.&#8221; It seems likely that Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and other US tech giants will pay the bulk of the 500 million euros ($554 million) a year Macron hopes to raise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The French treasury can argue that non-US companies will also be affected. Yet its position is undermined by the fact that Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire repeatedly called the measure a tax on &#8220;GAFA&#8221; &#8211; referring to Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither side is likely to back down. Trump has a track record of slapping punitive tariffs on ostensible allies, as he did with last year&#8217;s steel and aluminum duties on the European Union. His trade body has officially labeled France&#8217;s tax as discriminatory; it would be odd if he didn&#8217;t follow through. Equally, Macron and Le Maire have made political hay out of hammering Big Tech. They can&#8217;t be seen to cave to bullying from Trump, who is widely reviled in France.</p>
<p>That augurs poorly for an ambitious global attempt to update corporate tax rules for the digital age, which is being led by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The body&#8217;s tax chief, Pascal Saint-Amans, has until now managed to chart a course that kept both France and the US on side. His plan would empower the governments of major economies to tax some profits currently stashed away in tax havens like Ireland. It&#8217;s hard to see Trump and Macron&#8217;s officials amicably hashing out the details while engaged in a trade spat. The cheese war&#8217;s biggest victim will be prudent tax rules.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">People attend a culture and tourism festival themed on Dolan and Qiuci culture in Awat County of Aksu Prefecture, northwest China&#8217;s <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uygur Autonomous region, Oct. 25, 2019. The festival kicked off recently in Aksu Prefecture. (Xinhua/Sadat)</p>
<p>China should also be prepared that the trade war, from irrational confrontation to rational cooperation, could last all the way to 2035. China and the US won&#8217;t sit down and go back to rational discussions until 2026, after being exhausted from seven or eight years of wrestling without results.</p>
<p>The US has to admit that China&#8217;s revitalization is inevitable; the US can&#8217;t just keep dreaming about being the world&#8217;s No.1 forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two countries lack basic strategic mutual trust. The US doesn&#8217;t want to let China challenge the US&#8217; leading position in the world. The US believes that the core causes of the decline in its overall strength and leadership are because globalization is out of control and there is &#8220;unfair competition from China.&#8221; The US needs to change this misperception.</p>

<p>New Jersey is doubling down on the mall. The Garden State is home to one of the largest shopping complexes to open in recent memory. American Dream, as it&#8217;s called, offers a dizzying array of theme parks better suited to Dubai. The hope is that this will help push people through the door. With retail sales swiftly moving online, that may not be enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mega-mall was a long time in the making. Originally conceived as &#8220;Xanadu&#8221; 15 years ago, it has endured bankruptcy, multiple backers including US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Colony Capital&#8217;s Tom Barrack, and a price tag of about $5 billion. Triple Five, the developer of West Edmonton Mall in Canada and Mall of America, bought it in 2011 and is betting over-the-top experiences will decrease its exposure to retail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do that, Triple Five set aside 55 percent of the American Dream&#8217;s 3 million square feet for theme parks including a SpongeBob roller coaster, a ski slope, an ice rink and water slides. Other amenities range from nannies for parents who want to shop in peace to helipads for passengers who can afford to avoid the often-clogged Route 3 highway. The goal is to attract a projected 40 million people annually to the Meadowlands complex.</p>
<p>The retail stores like Tiffany and Saks Fifth Avenue occupying the other 45 percent of the space aren&#8217;t expected to open until March, however, which means they&#8217;ll miss the all-important holiday season. That&#8217;s poor timing for an industry on a roller coaster ride. Tiffany is being gobbled up by LVMH for $16.2 billion. Hudson&#8217;s Bay, the owner of Saks, is under attack by activists. Barneys New York, which had been touted as an anchor tenant, went belly up in November and was sold for peanuts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more people are shopping online. Morgan Stanley reckons retail-store traffic for the first three weeks of November fell nearly 30 percent compared to last year. That&#8217;s skewed due to the Thanksgiving holiday and Black Friday falling in the third full week of November in 2018 rather than the fourth this year. The last time that shift happened, between 2012 and 2013, the decline was just 15 percent.</p>
<p>E-commerce sales are likely to outpace the growth rate of brick-and-mortar sales during holidays, estimates software-and-analytics firm Adobe. The trend suggests malls are more of a nightmare than a dream.</p>

<p>Australian banks can, and probably will, sink further. Westpac just became the latest of the country&#8217;s Big Four to part ways with its top brass. Days after it was hit by scathing allegations from regulators, Chief Executive Brian Hartzer has departed and Chairman Lindsay Maxsted accelerated retirement plans. Persistent rot suggests investors may be underestimating the cost of a cleanup.</p>
<p>It has been a grim stretch for bankers Down Under. A spate of scandals and a widely watched 2018 public inquiry battered reputations. Now, Westpac stands accused by financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC of breaching money-laundering rules, with some payments potentially linked to child exploitation.</p>
<p>Lenders do not seem to be learning their lessons. AUSTRAC said Westpac was made aware of risks in 2016, but failed to tighten up processes until 2018, well after Commonwealth Bank of Australia&#8217;s (CBA) own similar troubles broke. Worse, even after the prime minister weighed in, Hartzer was quoted by The Australian newspaper to have told staff the problem was &#8220;not a major issue&#8221; for average citizens. It is a worrying development considering tough new rules on bank executive accountability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Westpac can expect to pay at least as much as CBA did in its record A$700 million ($475 million) settlement. With most of a A$2.5 billion capital raise already completed, Westpac should be able to cope. But that won&#8217;t be the whole tab.</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s prudential regulator is apt to have questions of its own. That could result in additional capital requirements. CBA was forced to hold an extra A$1 billion. And Westpac has already been told to top up while it fixes risk management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fallout also will include higher compliance costs and tech investment, which have already been increasing dramatically. What&#8217;s more, a new CEO can be expected to root out additional buried problems. All of that is set against a cooling economy squeezing margins. Following publication of the final Royal Commission report earlier this year, battered bank shares made a recovery to early-2018 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even after slipping in recent weeks, they are trading at a healthy premium to book value. The Westpac episode is a reminder that the costs of wrongdoing will pile up.</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-02/0f7070e9-5b5a-4df6-95ca-9a56420e7393.jpeg"><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo xuan/GT</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve&#8217;s (Fed&#8217;s) interest rate cuts have started a trend among central banks which is widely expected to continue in 2020. In this context, Yi Gang, governor of the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBC), China&#8217;s central bank, said in a signed article published on Sunday that China will not resort to quantitative easing (QE) even as the world&#8217;s major economies are approaching interest rates of zero. How can the PBC maintain normal monetary policy amid a rising tide of QE? It can do this because the slowdown pressure on the Chinese economy is fundamentally different from the economic crisis that occurred in Western economies. A flood-like monetary stimulus policy is not indispensable for China.</p>
<p>This round of QE, which was first introduced by the US to deal with the devastating impacts of the 2008 financial crisis, is facing the challenge of losing its economic stimulus effect in major developed countries while bringing more side effects. In 2008, normal monetary policy had lost its effectiveness in dealing with the impact of a financial crisis. The introduction of QE effectively resolved the problems and prevented economies and asset prices from spiraling downward, but now it is no longer working. What the ultra-loose monetary policy generally does is to provide liquidity to the economy, presenting a zero or negative-interest environment to boost economic growth.</p>
<p>However, in the long run, the stimulus policy will in turn delay the structural reform of economies, exacerbating existing structural problems. In recent years, the interest rates of major developed economies have been moving faster than their corresponding economic growths and inflation levels have been declining. The marginal effects of interest cuts and QE are being eliminated. Due to high debts, weak growth momentum and lingering deflationary pressures, major developed economies are being forced to &#8220;normalize&#8221; such unconventional monetary policies. The current downward pressure on the Chinese economy is fundamentally different from the economic and financial crisis that occurred in Western countries. Although the Chinese economy is faced with the impacts of a bruising China-US trade war, global economic downward pressure and an overlap of structural and cyclical problems, its growth is still at a reasonable level. China&#8217;s economy continues to maintain a medium-high level of economic growth. This can be seen clearly in the steady progress of its economic restructuring and optimization, the development of high-tech, high-end industries, the continual increase of consumption as a proportion of economic growth and the stable employment rate.</p>
<p>This is why China&#8217;s economy will continue to adopt a prudent and targeted monetary policy, and why it doesn&#8217;t resort to beggar-thy-neighbor actions and competitive exchange rate policies. China will insist upon the fundamental goal of stabilizing the yuan&#8217;s exchange rate and strengthening its guard of financial risks so as to build a proper monetary environment for promoting economic growth.</p>
<p>China has ample monetary policy tools and relatively large policy room to support its economy. There are preferential conditions both overseas and at home. The world&#8217;s major economies are taking measures to prevent deflation, providing low interest rates and low-inflation external conditions for the Chinese economy, which are preferential for China when taking measures to stimulate economic growth. Additionally, the domestic inflation is also at a relatively moderate level. Factors such as the rise in pork prices and the rise in prices of agricultural and sideline products are temporary phenomena. They are affected by the cyclical nature of agricultural products, and they will not affect the overall inflation level much, let alone squeeze the adjustment space of monetary stimulus policies.</p>
<p>China will continue to adopt a steady monetary policy and take countercyclical adjustment measures in order to keep liquidity reasonably abundant and to provide targeted stimulus to specific sectors. The monetary policies of major developed countries are still increasing liquidity, but China&#8217;s monetary policy has targeted measures which offer specific encouragements and restrictions to specific sectors. In the next phase, China will continue to improve and complete policy tools based on practical needs and strengthen weak links, supporting structural optimization.</p>
