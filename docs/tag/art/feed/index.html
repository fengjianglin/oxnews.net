<p>The New York Botanical Garden is rolling into a holiday season with its annual holiday train show, which features architectural replicas of the city&#8217;s Central Park &#8211; one of the most popular urban parks in the US.</p>
<p>Now in its 28th edition, the annual event transports visitors to a miniature metropolis as model trains zip through an enchanting display of more than 175 landmarks in New York, each re-created using items such as bark, lotus pods, acorns, cinnamon sticks and other natural materials.</p>
<p>Six replicas made their debut this year, which are Belvedere Castle, Bethesda Terrace, the Dairy, the Naumburg Bandshell and two graceful pedestrian bridges, according to Victoria Lewis, the botanical garden&#8217;s manager of interpretive content.</p>
<p>&#8220;In real life Bow Bridge is made of steel, but for our version, it&#8217;s twigs and willow bark,&#8221; said Lewis. Dating from 1862, the Bow Bridge is known for its subtle shape which is reminiscent of the bow of an archer or violinist.</p>
<p>The new miniature replicas are arrayed in a tableau with existing Central Park collection, including the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater and the Old Bandstand. In addition, famous New York buildings that are either next to the park or just inside it are on display, including the Plaza Hotel, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Rose Center for Earth and Space, which is part of the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s holiday train show is different from the ones in the previous years as it is held in a temporary exhibition space tailored just for the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show used to be held in the conservatory, the palm dome of which is under restoration.</p>
<p>Lewis said because the temperature is lower in the exhibition space this year compared to that of the conservatory, visitors will see more evergreen plants instead of tropical plants at the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has the effect of being more wintry and it really creates this wonderful indoor winter wonderland,&#8221; said Lewis.</p>
<p>In addition, more than 25 G-scale model trains and trolleys hum along a nearly half-a-mile-long track past re-creations of iconic sites from all five boroughs of New York City, the Hudson River Valley, and other locations in New York State.</p>
<p>The holiday train show has already started and will be running through January 26, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robbers made off with priceless 18th century jewelry from a state museum in Dresden on Monday, police and museum directors said, in a major art heist that has shocked Germany.</p>
<p>The thieves at dawn broke into the Green Vault at Dresden&#8217;s Royal Palace &#8211; home to around 4,000 precious objects of ivory, gold, silver and jewels &#8211; after a power cut deactivated the alarm.</p>
<p>The stolen artifacts included brilliant-cut diamonds that once belonged to a collection of jewelry of 18th-century Saxony ruler Augustus the Strong.</p>
<p>Museum directors had earlier feared much of three sets of diamond jewelry in the collection were snatched, but the loss turned out to be more limited than thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;The criminals didn&#8217;t manage to take everything,&#8221; director of Dresden&#8217;s state art collections Marion Ackermann told public broadcaster ZDF on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the stolen items are &#8220;of inestimable art-historical and cultural-historical value,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot put an exact value on them because they are priceless,&#8221; said Ackermann, adding she was &#8220;shocked by the brutality of the break-in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thieves launched their brazen raid after having set off a fire at an electrical panel near the museum in the early hours of Monday, deactivating its alarm as well as street lighting, police said.</p>
<p>Despite the power cut, a surveillance camera kept working and filmed two men breaking in.</p>
<p>A video released by police showed one of the men, armed with a flashlight, using an axe to smash the display case.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole act lasted only a few minutes,&#8221; said police in a statement.</p>
<p>The suspects then fled in an Audi A6 and remain on the run.</p>
<p>The apparent getaway car was found on fire later elsewhere in the city, said police, adding that the vehicle was being examined for clues.</p>
<p>Bild daily said the heist was &#8220;probably the biggest art theft since World War II.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dirk Syndram, director of the Green Vault itself, said the targeted jewelry sets amounted to &#8220;a kind of world heritage,&#8221; totalling about 100 items.</p>
<p>Founded by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony in 1723, the Green Vault is one of 12 museums which make up the famous Dresden State Art Collections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the oldest museums in Europe, the Green Vault holds treasures including a 63.8-centimeter figure of a Moor studded with emeralds and a 547.71-carat sapphire gifted by Tsar Peter I of Russia.</p>
<p>The museum is now made up of two sections &#8211; a historical part and a new area.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s break-in targeted the historical section, which contains around three-quarters of the museum&#8217;s treasures and which has a strict limit on the number of daily visitors.</p>
<p>Exhibits are arranged in nine rooms, including an ivory room, a silver gilt room and the central &#8220;Hall of Treasures.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of its most valuable pieces, the green diamond, is currently on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it is a headline attraction in the temporary exhibition<br />
<em>Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">An artwork of Picasso is at display at the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, on June 15, 2019. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>It is the closest that anyone outside the super rich is ever likely to get to owning a painting by Picasso.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A canvas by the Spanish master worth more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) is to be raffled off for charity.</p>
<p>Anyone buying a 100-euro ($110) ticket in the international draw has a one-in-200,000 chance of winning a still life of a stylized glass of absinthe and a newspaper Picasso created in 1921.</p>
<p>The draw, whose proceeds will go to the charity CARE to combat poverty in Africa, was launched at the Picasso Museum in Paris Tuesday.</p>
<p>The last time the organizers held one, six years ago, Picasso&#8217;s<br />
<em>Man with Opera</em> Hat was won by a 25-year-old Pittsburgh fire safety official, Jeffrey Gonano, who was looking for something to decorate his home.</p>
<p>The 5 million euros raised went to help preserve the ancient city of Tyre in Lebanon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Art and charity usually come together at gala dinners, where a few [wealthy] people fork out millionaire sums for a painting,&#8221; said Peri Cochin, the French television producer behind the draw.</p>
<p>She hopes to raise up to 19 million euros for CARE from the new raffle: 50,000 people &#8211; mostly from the US, the UK, Mexico and Brazil &#8211; took part in the last draw.</p>
<p>The painting this time comes from the billionaire Lebanese-born collector David Nahmad, who has one of the biggest private collection of Picassos in the world.</p>
<p>He will get 1 million euros from the draw with the rest going to the charity.</p>
<p>Picasso Museum director Laurent le Bon said the painting comes from a period when Picasso &#8220;synthesized the realist and cubist currents&#8221; of his work.</p>

<p>A new exhibition at the Lingnan Museum of Fine Art in South China&#8217;s Guangdon Province, <em>Being in the Heaven</em>, is showcasing the works artist Shen Shubin has created over the last two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Works on display include a series of oil paintings such as <em>Rational Meaning of Existence</em>, <em>Mysterious Sea</em> and <em>Triumphant Return</em>. The artist said at the opening that these works reflect his attempts at trying new ways of thinking and new art forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;People were curious about why I painted animals. First of all, I have had a special feeling toward animals since childhood. But I hope to give them some human personality, including the expression of people&#8217;s real lives and their understanding of life,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Ye Xiangming, the museum&#8217;s president, the exhibition is also an opportunity for the museum to inspire local audiences with artworks from a young artist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the exhibition ends on Sunday, Shen&#8217;s works will head out on a national tour that includes Taiyuan in North China&#8217;s Shanxi Province and Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
