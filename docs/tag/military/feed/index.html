<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The aircraft carrier <em>Liaoning</em> battle group steam on the sea. The aircraft carrier <em>Liaoning</em> (Hull 16), several guided-missile destroyers, frigates and dozens of aircraft attached to the Navy of the Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army took part in a combat exercise at an unidentified area east of the Bashi Channel in the western Pacific on Apr. 20. The exercise was a routine arrangement as a part of the PLA Navy&#8217;s annual training plan. (Photo/eng.chinamil.com.cn)</p>
<p>The Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy is training jet fighter pilots to sail and command warships, a move that aims to create more capable commanding officers for aircraft carriers, according to military experts.</p>
<p>Experienced pilots from carrier-borne aircraft units and advanced fighter jet units started learning warship combat and command at an undisclosed naval academy in late November, the PLA Daily reported on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a whole new exploration by the navy to develop ship-aircraft command talent, as China&#8217;s aircraft carrier force is in urgent need of such talent, the PLA Daily said, noting that the trainees were carefully selected, passing more than 10 tests including political thought, psychological quality and comprehensive abilities.</p>
<p>One such trainee is Xu Ying, chief of staff at an aircraft carrier-borne fighter jet base, who was among the first in the country to receive certification to operate a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier at both daytime and nighttime.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the training, I need to finish courses including ship navigation, basic combat, military training and management, strategic thinking and aircraft carrier combat,&#8221; Xu said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will gain the ability to command coordinated ship-aircraft operations by actually sailing warships and passing tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>The training seeks to develop inter-disciplinary talent, as their experiences in both flying and sailing would work in synergy, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing military analyst, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe this is a move that aims to create top commanding officers for future aircraft carriers,&#8221; Wei said, noting that this kind of talent would be practical in boosting the capability of carriers.</p>
<p>Many US aircraft carrier captains and officers at command posts used to be carrier-borne aircraft pilots, and this model is worth studying, Wei said.</p>
<p>Liu Zhe, captain of the<br />
<em>Liaoning</em>, China&#8217;s first aircraft carrier, said on China Central Television in August 2017 that only the US required aircraft carrier captains to be pilots first due to the massive scale of its aircraft carrier fleet.</p>
<p>Liu said he was only a surface vessel officer and no pilot. He said he learned to fly trainer aircraft and helicopters, but only for a few hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we have more aircraft carriers in the future and more [carrier-based] pilots, as they grow older, there will be [pilots who become captains],&#8221; Liu said.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Special mission aircraft including anti-submarine aircraft are being built in a pulse assembly line at AVIC Shaanxi Aircraft Industry (Group) Corporation Ltd. Photo: Screenshot from China Central Television</p>
<p>China is mass-producing special mission aircraft, including anti-submarine aircraft, early warning aircraft, surveillance aircraft and electronic warfare aircraft, a genre of warplanes that Chinese experts said on Sunday will help create a full information system that allows the Chinese military to recognize every hostile movement and even sabotage enemy communications.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Aircraft Industry (Group) Corporation Ltd (SAIC) under the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) has been manufacturing special mission aircraft with its pulse assembly line, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The advanced assembly line has been recently built, has a size of more than two soccer fields and fused digital, information-oriented and intelligence concepts, CCTV said, noting that compared to the traditional assembly workshops at SAIC, the new pulse assembly line is 30 percent more efficient in manufacturing aircraft and requires less workers.</p>
<p>The pulse assembly line at SAIC has five stations, each is assigned with tasks of assembling certain components to its aircraft, said Peng Fei, chief engineer at SAIC, on CCTV.</p>
<p>Components will enter from station one, stopping at each station and leave station five as fully assembled aircraft ready for delivery, Peng said, noting that the next aircraft will enter the line as the previous one goes to the next station, enabling a very efficient manufacturing model.</p>
<p>The establishment of a pulse assembly line is an indication that China&#8217;s special mission aircraft have entered a mass-production phase, a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pulse assembly line is only cost efficient when it produces a certain type of aircraft in large numbers, since the construction of such a line is expensive,&#8221; the expert said.</p>
<p>For instance, as many as 10 fully assembled special mission aircraft including KJ-500 early warning aircraft and other surveillance aircraft can be seen parked in an open area at SAIC in a single screenshot of the official CCTV report. They are expected to take test flights and be delivered to the military.</p>
<p>Most of China&#8217;s special mission aircraft are designed based on the Y-8 transport plane because of its large payload capability and utility, CCTV reported.</p>
<p>China for the first time displayed its special mission aircraft fleet at the National Day military parade on October 1. The fleet included Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft, KJ-500 early warning aircraft, Y-8 surveillance aircraft, Y-9 psychological warfare aircraft, Y-9 communications countermeasures aircraft, Y-8 electronic countermeasures aircraft, and Y-8 command and communications aircraft, according to Weapon magazine.</p>
<p>A massive fleet of these warplanes will weave a full information system in information-based modern warfare and give the Chinese military an edge by grasping every detail on the battlefield and disrupting hostile communications, the expert said.</p>

<p>China and India launched a joint counter-terrorism exercise on Saturday not far from the Chinese-Indian border, a move which Chinese experts said will boost the strategic mutual trust of the two countries&#8217; militaries.</p>
<p>The 2019 Hand-in-Hand exercise started Saturday at the Umroi Cantonment, about 25 kilometer from Shillong, capital city of Meghalaya in northeast India, with each side sending 130 soldiers, China Youth Daily reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s troops are from the People&#8217;s Liberation Army Tibet military command and arrived in India on Friday via both land and air transportation, the report said.</p>
<p>The 16-day drills, which consist of three phases of adaptation training, mixed training and comprehensive exercises, will mix Chinese and Indian troops into two groups as soldiers and officers from the two countries live and train together, understanding each other&#8217;s skills, tactics, training methods and command procedures.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s exercise is the eighth joint counter-terrorism exercise between China and India since 2007, China Youth Daily said.</p>
<p>The Hand-in-Hand exercise was suspended in 2017 due to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1062419.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doklam standoff</a> and resumed in 2018.</p>
<p>Joint counter-terrorism tactical drills and the setup of a counter-terrorism command post will be included in the exercise in order to increase the troops&#8217; ability to combat terrorism together, according to Colonel K.J. Singh, commander of the participating Indian troops, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Sunday</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;The joint exercise will further deepen military communication and cooperation between the two sides, boosting mutual understanding and friendly relations, and contribute to the regional peace and development,&#8221; said Hu Chunguang, commander of the participating Chinese troops, on CCTV.</p>
<p>The exercise came after the second informal meeting between the two countries&#8217; top leaders in the southern Indian city of Chennai in October, making it a practical action pushing for military mutual trust, which is an important consensus reached by the two countries&#8217; leaders in the meeting, Qian Feng, a research fellow at the national strategy institute of Tsinghua University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>Qian pointed out that the location of the drills is not far from the border, an indication that the Indian side no longer sees the issue as warily as before.</p>
<p>Citing official sources, Indian media reported that the next round of border talks between Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval could take place tentatively on December 21.</p>
<p>The dialogue is meant to intensify efforts to achieve a &#8220;fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution&#8221; to the question at an early date, helping maintain peace in border areas and preventing any military flare-up which could jeopardize the overall development of bilateral ties, the Times of India reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> has not confirmed Wang&#8217;s visit.<br />

<p>After a top Chinese arms firm showcased multiple types of artificial diamonds at a recent jewelry exhibition, military experts on Wednesday said the gemstones could also be used in military equipment, including laser weapons and other precision machines.</p>
<p>The colorful synthetic diamonds on display at the recent 2019 China International Jewellery Fair in Beijing included large, high clarity samples, according to a statement by China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) on its WeChat account on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Synthetic diamonds are made in laboratories using special materials which are put under high pressure and temperatures or treated with chemical vapors.</p>
<p>NORINCO is the developer of many of China&#8217;s main battle equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, guns, rockets and munitions.</p>
<p>Military analysts said artificial diamonds have many practical military uses.</p>
<p>High-energy laser weapons may need industrial-level diamonds to ensure that their energy output is high enough to damage their targets, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Artificially produced diamonds can be used in core components of laser weapons and cost far less than natural diamonds, Wei said.</p>
<p>Diamonds are also widely used in radar equipment, high-precision machine manufacturing and aerospace optical devices, analysts said, noting that their hard, corrosion-resistant traits make them useful in a range of products from drills to microelectronics.</p>
<p>Due to the wide potential of diamonds, foreign countries often list artificial diamond-making technologies as confidential and won&#8217;t share information with China, leading the country to independently develop its own processes to make artificial diamonds for its arms industry and high-tech development, analysts said.</p>
<p>If the Chinese arms giant is able to sell a significant number of artificial diamonds to jewelers, the money could also be reinvested in its arms research projects, military observers said.</p>

<p>China is sending its troops to Pakistan for a month-long joint military exercise, a move that will boost the two countries&#8217; military cooperation and capability to jointly deal with terrorist threats including those targeting joint projects with China, experts said on Monday.</p>
<p>A Chinese unit from a special forces brigade of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Military Region departed from their base camp Saturday morning and began mobilizing in Pakistan for the &#8220;Warrior VII&#8221; joint exercise, using vehicles and aerial transportation, according to a statement released on Monday by China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/2.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of National Defense</a>.</p>
<p>This is the seventh &#8220;Warrior&#8221; series exercise between the two countries&#8217; special forces, the ministry said, noting that the drills will focus on deepening cooperation and communication, learning from each other&#8217;s combat experience and boosting the ability to deal with security threats and launch diversified missions.</p>
<p>A new exercise subject, joint defense of key facilities, will be added to the drills, as troops will engage in counter-terrorism in mountainous areas, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Li Wei, a counter-terrorism expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday that key facilities might include iconic government and civilian buildings and major projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, as these could be targets for terrorists, based on past events.</p>
<p>Construction sites, mines, harbors and highways might also be vulnerable to terrorist attacks, Li said.</p>
<p>The joint exercise will help to strengthen weak spots and find ways to prevent attacks in the first place, Li said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drills will feature live ammunition that will put both commanders&#8217; and soldiers&#8217; capabilities to the test, said Yang Lei, commander of the Chinese unit, in the defense ministry statement, noting that the event will enrich military training cooperation and deepen the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani armies.</p>
<p>Chinese and Pakistani air forces wrapped up the half-month-long Shaheen VIII joint exercises, featuring some of the two countries&#8217; top aircraft, in northwestern China in August. The two countries will also hold a joint naval exercise in Pakistani waters in January.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The Taihu, a military supply ship, conducted a replenishment docking with civilian container ship Fuzhou in an offshore area in mid-November amid the Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army&#8217;s (PLA) exploration of new ways to replenish ships at sea, the PLA Daily reported Monday. </p>
<p>This was the first time for Taihu to receive supplies from a civilian vessel, according to the report. </p>
<p>The success of the replenishment laid a foundation for mutual replenishment of various kinds of materials between military and civilian ships, it read. </p>
<p>The naval fleet is usually accompanied by supply ships. When supply ships start to deplete their cargo, they need to return to port for replenishment to restore their original capacity. </p>
<p>&#8220;It would save a lot of time if other ships could replenish these ships at sea,&#8221; Yu Yongyue, chief of staff of the detachment under the Northern Theater Command which Taihu serves, was quoted as saying. </p>
<p>Yu noted that mutual supply at sea between military and civilian ships is common in the navies of world powers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Making their debut in the general public for the first time, DF-17 missiles join the National Day parade held in Beijing on October 1, 2019. Photo: Fan Lingzhi/GT</p>
<p>The DF-17, China&#8217;s hypersonic missile that was first revealed at the National Day military parade on October 1, might not be the only hypersonic aircraft program China possesses, a report by the state broadcaster suggested.</p>
<p>Analysts stressed that China will not fall behind in related technologies compared with the US and Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the test subjects that were made available to the public, the Xingkong-2 (Starry Sky-2) might use a different flight pattern to the DF-17,&#8221; said military expert Ma Jun on Military Time, a China Central Television (CCTV) program on military affairs, on Saturday, without further elaboration.</p>
<p>According to Ma, the Xingkong-2 is still in the trial phase and more tests are expected.</p>
<p>The Xingkong-2 Ma referred to is the first Chinese waverider hypersonic vehicle unveiled by the country, dating a year earlier than the DF-17.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed by the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Xingkong-2 was successfully tested at a target range in Northwest China in August 2018, the academy announced then.</p>
<p>When the DF-17 missile made its debut at the National Day parade this year, some thought it might be the final product of the Xingkong-2 project.</p>
<p>One distinctive difference between the Xingkong-2 and the DF-17 is that the former has a fairing and the latter does not, making the two very different in appearance alone, analysts pointed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They noted that the time does not match either, as the Xingkong-2 was only tested in 2018 and is not likely to enter Chinese military service as early as 2019.</p>
<p>The CCTV program introduced two genres of hypersonic aircraft: one is a glide-boost, meaning the aircraft is propelled into the sky via a rocket and glides in the air using shock waves generated by its own hypersonic flight, while the other is air-breathing, meaning the aircraft uses a scramjet engine to provide thrust.</p>
<p>The DF-17 is said to be a glide-boost vehicle, but it is not known what type the Xingkong-2 might be, other than it could be different from the DF-17, although it was also propelled by a rocket, according to Ma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US and Russia are striving to develop hypersonic weapons with both glide-boost and air-breathing technologies, as the two have different strengths and shortcomings, a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times. China will not fall behind and could develop multiple types of hypersonic weapons using different technologies in the future, the expert predicted.</p>
