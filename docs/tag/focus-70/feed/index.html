<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />China’s latest bomber, the H-6N with refueling capability, made its debut at the National Day parade in Beijing on Tuesday, and Chinese military analysts said that the new bomber’s ability to take aerial refueling can give it a much longer operational range compared to its predecessor H-6K.</p>
<p>Three H-6N bombers flew above Tiananmen Square during the parade.</p>
<p>The new H-6N with refueling capability is believed to be the latest entry to the H-6 bomber family, with many improvements made to its predecessor H-6K, including an in-flight fuel-receiving probe on the nose of the aircraft, military observers said.</p>
<p>This probe will allow the H-6N with refueling capability to conduct aerial refueling, significantly extending its operational range and expanding weapons load, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The H-6N with refueling capability is capable of launching more powerful missiles, Yang Chengjun, a Chinese missile expert and quantum defense scientist, told the Global Times.</p>

<p>China showcased the new DF-17, a ballistic missile said to be hypersonic with a very high defense penetration capability, for the first time at the National Day parade on Tuesday, with Chinese military expert saying that it is almost impossible to be intercepted by enemies.</p>
<p>DF-17 conventional ballistic missiles were displayed at the event in Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>The DF-17 is a very recently developed type of short to medium-range missile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will play a vital role in safeguarding China&#8217;s territorial integrity, as regions including the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and Northeast Asia are all within its striking range, Yang Chengjun, a Chinese missile expert and quantum defense scientist, told the Global Times, noting that South Korea has been deploying the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1012594.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THAAD</a> air defense system and Japan is fielding SM-3 interceptor missiles, which are security threats to China.</p>
<p>The DF-17 missile features a hypersonic glide vehicle as its warhead, which can travel at 10 times the speed of sound, UK-based media outlet Daily Mail reported in June.</p>
<p>The very high speed leaves enemies with little time to react, military observers noted.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional ballistic missiles, the DF-17 can change its trajectory in mid-flight, giving enemies a minimal chance of intercepting it, Yang said.</p>
<p>If hostile air defense systems like THAAD, SM-3 and Patriot get the chance to capture the DF-17&#8217;s launch and prepare for its arrival in advance, there is some possibility of interception, but this rarely happens since a launch in actual combat will be done secretly, Yang said.</p>
<p>Other countries have also been developing hypersonic weapons, like the US AGM-183A and Russian Avangard missiles.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the DF-41, made its debut at the National Day parade in Beijing on Tuesday, which Chinese military experts said is a message to the world that China has sufficient and reliable strategic nuclear power to respond to any &#8220;nuclear blackmail&#8221; from any country.</p>
<p>16&nbsp;transporter erector launchers of the DF-41 missile were inspected during the parade in Tiananmen Square on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A DF-41 missile has an operational range of more than 14, 000 kilometers and can carry about 10 independently targetable nuclear warheads, capable of hitting anywhere on Earth, according to the US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, and this would make DF-41 the world&#8217;s longest range missile, surpassing the range of the US LGM-30 Minuteman which has a reported range of 13,000 kilometers.</p>
<p>Yang Chengjun, a Chinese expert on missile technology and nuclear strategy and chief scientist of quantum defense, told the Global Times that the DF-41 is Chinese fourth-generation strategic nuclear weapon and has the longest operational range among all Chinese ICBMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This ICBM&#8217;s research and development was very successful, and its technology is very mature. During testing, there was no failure record,&#8221; Yang noted.</p>
<p>Wu Jian, editor of Defense Weekly under the Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News, told the Global Times that the multiple transporter erector launchers of the DF-41 missile shown in the parade proved that the People&#8217;s Liberation Army has already built a massive and advanced system to support the use of this missile. &#8220;This proves that China has sufficient and reliable strategic nuclear power, and decision-makers have the confidence to show and use them to respond to any kind of nuclear threat from any country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter how advanced the missile is, it always needs a mature and comprehensive system to make sure it can accurately strike a target, which at least includes intelligence gathering, satellite surveillance, logistics, and construction of launching positions,&#8221; Wu noted.</p>

<p></center><br />
<br />Forty-two people, including Chinese and foreigners, were awarded the highest honors for their contributions to China over the past seven decades, which analysts said manifests the core of Chinese values.</p>
<p>President Xi Jinping presented national medals and honorary titles of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) to awardees in the Great Hall of the People on Sunday morning, ahead of the country&#8217;s grand celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the PRC, scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
<p>Thirty-six Chinese people were awarded the highest state honors. Eight recipients whose exceptional contributions to the development of China were recognized, receiving the Medal of the Republic, the top civilian award granted by China. Another 28 recipients were granted medals for national honorary titles for those who made exceptional contributions in specific fields. These include &#8220;the people&#8217;s scientist,&#8221; &#8220;the people&#8217;s artist,&#8221; &#8220;the people&#8217;s hero&#8221; and &#8220;the people&#8217;s role model.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six foreigners were awarded the Friendship Medal, which signifies long-lasting unity and friendship between Chinese people and foreigners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivered a speech at the presentation ceremony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only when we worship heroes can heroes emerge; only when people strive to become heroes can heroes come forth,&#8221; Xi said, adding that the CPC and the country have always paid tribute to heroes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Who are the heroes?</span></strong></p>
<p>Laureates of the Medal of the Republic included a posthumous award for Yu Min, dubbed the &#8220;father of China&#8217;s hydrogen bomb.&#8221; Yu was born in 1926 and died in January 2019. He was behind the country&#8217;s first successful hydrogen bomb test during the Cold War era. The technological breakthroughs he made filled a national void in atomic nucleus theory.</p>
<p>Li Yannian is a combat hero who participated in more than 20 battles, including the Liberation War (1946-49), the Korean War (1950-53) and the Defensive Counterattack against Vietnam in 1979. He was awarded the title &#8220;First Class Hero&#8221; and honorary medals.</p>
<p>Professor Gao Mingxuan is one of the 28 laureates who received an honorary title. Gao, 91, is a renowned contemporary jurist and law educator, as well the main founder and pioneer of the criminal law of the PRC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gao told the Global Times that his entire life has been devoted to academic research and he is still teaching. He noted that the younger generation often looks to the West and believes that whatever is Western must be good, instead of working in a down-to-earth manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The six Friendship Medals were presented to Raul Castro, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba,&nbsp; Thai Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, Galina Kullikova, first vice president of the Russia-China Friendship Association, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, former French prime minister and special representative of the French government for China, Tanzanian diplomat Salim Ahmed Salim and Canadian professor Isabel Crook.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Global Times on Thursday, Raffarin said he has been a witness to the incredible and impressive development of China during the past 50 years, while the international situation is deeply troubled by the return of the excesses of nationalism, protectionism and unilateralism, largely incarnated by US President Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isabel Crook, 104, is one of the six foreigners who won the Friendship Medal. Crook, emeritus professor of the Beijing Foreign Studies University, has made outstanding contributions to China&#8217;s education and communication with foreign countries.</p>
<p>Michael Crook, son of Isabel Crook, told the Global Times on Sunday that his mother feels honored to receive this award. What&#8217;s more, she feels honored to have witnessed and even participated in China&#8217;s revolutions and development.</p>
<p>Crook said the award reminded his mother of many of her friends. &#8220;Those who have died would feel happy to see today&#8217;s China if they were alive,&#8221; Crook said.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Holding on to values</span></strong></p>
<p>As the awards were granted at such an important time, ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the PRC, analysts believe it bears great historical and social significance and will help generate centripetal strength and unity among the entire Chinese society.</p>
<p>Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Peking University, believes that the awards to both Chinese people and foreigners on the 70th anniversary of the PRC&#8217;s founding are paying respect to the history of the past seven decades. All the recipients are advanced in years, which means their contributions have withstood the test of history.</p>
<p>Zhang noted that the most prominent characteristics of these people is persistence and being down-to-earth, which is also the key spirit of modern China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The awards are a manifestation of the values that Chinese people endorse,&#8221; Zhang told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>Zhang Shuhua, director of the Institute of Information Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, was among the Chinese scholars who proposed setting up a national honorary system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to cultivate heroes and we need a social atmosphere for the emergence of heroes, and the awards will encourage us to pursue something just and positive,&#8221; Zhang Shuhua told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>An alumnus of the Beijing-based Beihang University which specializes in aeronautical and space technologies, who gave his surname as Li, told the Global Times on Sunday that he felt encouraged by the award to Sun Jiadong, who played a leading role in the design of the country&#8217;s first recoverable remote-sensing satellite and first geostationary communication satellite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li now works in the aeronautical field.</p>
<p>&#8220;The work is hard, and we often have to work overtime, but the spirit of the older generation like Sun will drive us to work persistently and continuously,&#8221; Li said.</p>

<p>In the run up to the National Day which falls on October 1, all sectors of society across the nation have been busy organizing events to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. From bustling streets to sleepy back alleys, flags and banners have been hoisted to celebrate the big day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a giant screen at China Evergrande Center in Hong Kong&#8217;s Wan Chai district, a slogan which says &#8220;Warmly celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China&#8221; scrolls in a continuous loop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outdoor display screens on multiple buildings on both sides of Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong have similar messages of celebration, creating a festival atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Beijing, floral displays are placed on both sides of Chang&#8217;an Avenue, the capital&#8217;s major thoroughfare. The displays present the themes of &#8220;Beautiful China,&#8221; &#8220;Created in China,&#8221; and &#8220;Community of Common Destiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Beijinger surnamed Jiang told the Global Times he was glad to see the national flags hanging all over the residential quarter of Balizhuang in Chaoyang district, which he said has put him in a lively mood for the festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My little grandson has hung two national flags up at home. My wife went to record a song and dance video performed by choir of seniors,&#8221; said Jiang, adding that his family was eagerly anticipating the landmark National Day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An activity called &#8220;Take a picture with the national flag&#8221; was carried out in cities across China, another way in which Chinese people were able to participate in the country&#8217;s grand celebration. </p>

<p>Military officers and soldiers were seen training in preparation for the upcoming National Day parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, after the military parade training center in Beijing opened to the media on September 17.</p>
<p>On the training field, lines of troops wearing green uniforms of the army, white uniforms of the navy and blue uniforms of the air force were practicing different parade moves one after another.</p>
<p>With temperatures still high at the end of summer, their clothes were soaked with sweat.</p>
<p>Zhang Hongjie, the military flag holder in the phalanx of the honor guards, has participated in several past parades. Zhang told reporters that the average age in his phalanx is 20.</p>
<p>Although Zhang and his team members are very experienced, the parade requires such precision that rulers are used to make sure every step is exactly the same.</p>

<p>The upcoming parade will for the first time feature a Chinese peacekeeping force, which will be led by Major General Xu Youze. Xu told the Global Times that having a peacekeeping force in the parade shows China&#8217;s responsibility as a major country in the world.</p>
<p>Xu, 55, joined the training with younger team members and saw his weight drop from 71 to 64 kilograms. &#8220;As a team leader, I must be the benchmark for the team,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wearing white berets, light blue military uniforms and white boots and holding guns, female members of the militia phalanx who come from government organizations, schools, hospitals and companies in Beijing&#8217;s Chaoyang district also trained hard.</p>
<p>When they just started training, they had weak foundations, but improved very quickly after undertaking one hour of physical exercises every day in the initial stage, said Zhu Deyou, the phalanx leader, noting that the militia phalanx can now march in a very orderly manner.</p>

<p>The training center also provides logistical support facilities such as a hospital, a food supply center and a tailor station.</p>
<p>Staff members at the tailor station told the Global Times that crotches, trouser legs and armpits of clothes and soles of shoes are the areas that see the most wear and tear. Many clothes need to be tailored into smaller sizes because parade participants have lost weight significantly since the training started.</p>
<p>Three joint rehearsals have been successfully conducted in downtown Beijing since September, and the actual parade will be held on October 1. </p>

<p>Beijing residents got a sneak peek at China&#8217;s upcoming National Day parade on October 1, as aircraft formations conducted a rehearsal above the city&#8217;s downtown on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>According to a video released on the Sina Weibo account of the People&#8217;s Daily, a KJ-2000 early warning aircraft led eight J-10 fighter jets from the Bayi Aerobatic Team, which dragged plumes of red, blue, yellow and green.</p>
<p>Photos and videos taken by military enthusiasts and ordinary Beijing residents, and circulated on Chinese social media, show other participating aircraft including an echelon of five J-20 stealth fighter jets and helicopters flying in formation to form the number of 70, in honor of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<p>Y-20 large transport planes, J-15 aircraft carrier-based fighter jets and Z-10 attack helicopters were also seen above Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really happy to see the rehearsal. The aircraft and the &#8216;rainbow&#8217; it dragged were wonderful,&#8221;&nbsp;a Beijing resident surnamed Wang told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really proud of my country and its development over the past decades. I&#8217;m looking forward to the actual parade on October 1,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The photos and videos went viral. The Sina Weibo post by the People&#8217;s Daily gained 20,000 likes in only about two hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;My adrenalin was pumping. Go China!!!&#8221; reads a typical comment by net users.</p>
<p>Other netizens recalled the founding ceremony held on October 1, 1949, when Zhou Enlai, the first premier of the PRC, asked warplanes to fly over Tiananmen Square twice because of their limited number, according to China Youth Daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are as many warplanes as you want now.&#8221; &#8220;This flourishing age must be what you have envisioned back then, premier Zhou,&#8221; were typical comments that received a lot of &#8216;likes&#8217; on social media.</p>
<p>There have been two other rehearsals in downtown Beijing, which took place over the previous two weekends, but aircraft formations did not attract as much attention as they did on Sunday.</p>
