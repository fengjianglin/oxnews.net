<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT</p>
<p>China is not Mexico. It&#8217;s impossible that the US can strike a trade deal with China by forcing Beijing to make big compromises, as the US did to Mexico when it came to the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump on Tuesday retweeted a post from US Representative Mike Kelly, who claimed that the USMCA is &#8220;a big win.&#8221; The Financial Times said Trump&#8217;s &#8220;disruptive approach to trade&#8221; is delivering results at a time of heightened commercial tensions with China and the EU. Some have linked the USMCA to the ongoing trade row with China, and they hope the new North American deal can be used as a model to pressure Beijing to accept US trade policy.</p>
<p>The USMCA requires 40-45 percent of auto content to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. The rule is likely to boost manufacturing in the US, where wages are higher than in Mexico. According to Mexico News Daily, just 0.5 percent of 53.8 million workers in Mexico earn $16 or more per hour. The deal casts a cloud over the auto industry in Mexico.</p>
<p>Why did Mexico accept a deal that may hit its auto industry? Mexico&#8217;s economy is highly dependent on the US. Some statistics showed about 80 percent of Mexico&#8217;s exports went to the US in 2018. This may show why the US can force Mexico to make compromises in trade talks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same scenario won&#8217;t play out in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington. China&#8217;s exports to the US account for 19 percent of its total exports of goods, far below the 80 percent recorded by Mexico. More importantly, China has a huge domestic market that can help offset the negative effects of the trade war as some Chinese exporters lose market share in the US. It&#8217;s very unlikely for Beijing to make compromises in trade talks with the US in the way that Mexico did.</p>
<p>Trump has remade the landscape of US trade policy since he came into office. The USMCA, which was touted by Trump as the best and most important trade deal ever made by the US, offers a window on his thinking about global trade. The deal requires 75 percent of auto content to be made in North America. The rule may exert an effect on not only Mexico but also China. Mexico is an important export destination of made-in-China auto content. The USMCA is likely to hit China&#8217;s auto sector and have an impact on the global manufacturing chain.</p>
<p>However, Trump can&#8217;t totally reshape the global industrial chain through his protectionist measures and &#8220;disruptive approach to trade.&#8221; Whether or not China and the US can reach a trade deal, the bilateral trade game is likely to continue. China will fight to the end to defend its interests and support free trade.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Xinhua/Zhan Yan</p>
<p>Could US agricultural imports curb inflation in China? Probably not. China&#8217;s shortage of pigs is a fact, which means the country&#8217;s pork imports will expand further. But Brazil, instead of the US, is likely to become the biggest beneficiary of China&#8217;s pork import expansion.</p>
<p>The spike of November&#8217;s consumer inflation was mainly attributed to rising food prices, particularly pork, which is a staple of the Chinese diet. Analysts estimate that holiday-season spending at the end of the year may push the demand for pork up further and pile more pressure on China to import US farm goods. However, those analysts are ignoring a fact: the US is not the only source of China&#8217;s pork imports. South American and European countries are likely to gain more from China&#8217;s increasing pork imports.</p>
<p>There is no need to read too deeply into November&#8217;s consumer inflation reading. Soaring pork prices have gradually slowed in recent weeks. From November 25 to December 1, the wholesale price of pork dropped 3 percent from the previous week, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a>. The current situation is not as severe as it was in the beginning of November.</p>
<p>China has stepped up efforts to stabilize hog production and ensure the country&#8217;s pork supply. Data from the Ministry of Commerce suggests such measures have begun to take effect. While China is reasonably seeking to boost its pork imports, the country will strive to expand domestic supply to meet pork demand and curb a further increase in pork prices.</p>

<p>How will China withstand the impact of US tariffs and the trade war? A look at the Chinese economy may offer some clues.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy is nearing a key moment in its modern history as the entire country sprints toward achieving the first centennial goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects next year. According to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/972044.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13th Five-Year Plan</a> (2016-20), China has several tasks. It needs to double its 2010 GDP and the per capita income of both urban and rural residents by 2020, as well as maintain medium-high economic growth. It must also accelerate the optimization and upgrading of the industrial structure, eliminate rural poverty, improve environmental conditions, and raise living standards in aspects like education, medical care, housing and elderly care.</p>
<p>Given the current economic situation, the expected GDP growth and other targets are widely considered reachable. In 2018, China&#8217;s GDP already exceeded 90 trillion yuan ($13 trillion), putting it on track to accomplish the goal of doubling the size of its economy by 2020 from 2010.</p>
<p>Moreover, in its drive to build a well-off society by 2020, China has been transitioning its economy from a phase of rapid growth to one of high-quality development. The authorities have been advancing work on expanding and increasing consumption, reducing income inequality, and improving environmental protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As China is set to achieve all its 2020 goals, the country is no longer an export-dependent economy as its economic restructuring continues to unfold. A successful transformation will enable China to withstand external pressure with its own strong market.</p>
<p>Although China&#8217;s economic transformation isn&#8217;t happening overnight, the US-China trade war has apparently accelerated the process. To a certain extent, the long-lasting trade friction may cause the rearrangement and reorganization of the global supply chain, forcing some industries to move to other countries, affecting China&#8217;s economic growth in the short to medium term. However, in the meantime, such external pressure may also spur indigenous innovation in China, pushing some domestic companies to develop high-end industries, which is exactly what the economic restructuring and transformation requires.</p>
<p>While US-China friction in trade and technology may be the new normal in the years to come, the dynamics of the Chinese economy itself will really determine the country&#8217;s growth. As China moves fully into a moderately prosperous society, it also has the ability to further open its markets to the world, allowing other countries to share the dividends of China&#8217;s rise.</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-08/2cec1dce-9e68-4077-9bab-66fbf0dc0831.jpeg"><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Xia Qing/GT</p>
<p>Electric vehicles are environmentally friendly, and now are gradually moving from the periphery of the auto industry to be broadly accepted by Chinese consumers. Whether EVs will outshine internal combustion cars and be a mainstream force on China&#8217;s roads remains elusive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sales of new energy cars have been flat to date in 2019, as the central and provincial governments slashed incentives in the middle of the year, by reducing fiscal subsidies to the buyers. As a result, this year&#8217;s total electric vehicle sales are predicted to come close to 1.25 million, on par with 2018 sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authorities in Beijing are discussing possible policy tools to support the industry in the medium to long run. As an emerging strategic industry, China needs to dangle ample government incentives to inspire massive buyers and cultivate the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To classify it as a strategic industry means major global economies are now investing heavily in EVs, which will become a hotly contested battleground among the world&#8217;s top 10 largest economies &#8211; including US, Germany, Japan,, France, South Korea and China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the health of a 1.4 billion population, China needs to ramp up efforts to leapfrog the competitors and be the global frontrunner in phasing out emission-heavy fossil fuel gas-guzzlers from its streets and rapidly replacing them with EVs. In addition to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions and help the global environmental cause, the country&#8217;s vast elderly people and underage children deserve to inhale fresher and pollutant-free air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a spate of well-choreographed government incentives and publicity schemes promoting quick sales of zero-emissions EVs, Chinese consumers will make informed choices about the economic and environmental advantages of going all-electric.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On December 3, the State Council&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/6.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a> (MIIT) enacted that by 2025 a quarter of all new car sales in China should be new-energy vehicles, indicating that up to 7.5 million out of that year&#8217;s estimated 30 million annual car sales will be electric. It&#8217;s a courageous government plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To realize the set target, China must mete out polices of efficacy, for instance, learning from Norway and France by outlawing gas-fired vehicle sales in 2040, or even earlier. At present, only China&#8217;s southern tropical Hainan island rules that fossil fuel cars must not be marketed there in 2030.</p>
<p>More Chinese provinces should follow the steps of Hainan, experts say. Only by decimating anticipations, scores of the world&#8217;s car manufacturers will be forced to investi more in EV motors, batteries and electronic systems, and simultaneously, the consumers will be lured to refuse dirty internal combustion cars and embrace EVs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, government incentives should go up accordingly, as price remains a primary consideration for most car buyers. For example, Norway&#8217;s generous incentives have pushed the EV market share close to 60 percent. In South China, Shenzhen city has made its fleet of public buses and taxi cabs all-electric, while 80 percent of Beijing&#8217;s buses are now electric.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s high-tech internet upstarts also play a role in accelerating widespread EV use. Car-hailing platforms like Didi Chuxing is directing its drivers to buy electric vehicles, and many courier services now demand their senders to ride electric scooters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2020, there will be some heavyweight electric car manufacturers entering China&#8217;s market, including Volkswagen, Tesla and Toyota. Volkswagen is to launch two electric car factories in 2020, with yearly production reaching 1 million in 2022, according to news reports. Domestically, BYD in Shenzhen, BAIC in Beijing, NIO in Shanghai, Xpeng in Guangzhou and Byton in Nanjing will be the major EV forces contesting in the battleground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pressure from the China-US trade war will not stop China from changing its industrial structure. Instead, it will only motivate the country to upgrade its services sector in preparation for the forthcoming expansion of consumption.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Chinese economy has witnessed a surge in the services sector. Data from the fourth national economic census showed that there were a total of 14.49 million enterprises in the tertiary sector as of the end of 2018, up 164 percent from the end of 2013.</p>
<p>Thanks to the rapid development of the services industry, China&#8217;s domestic consumption demand has also grown quickly. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, total retail sales of consumer goods in China jumped 9 percent year-on-year to 38.1 trillion yuan ($5.76 trillion) in 2018, while US retail sales rose 5 percent to $6.04 trillion during the same period. Since China&#8217;s consumption was already equivalent to 95.36 percent of the US total last year, many observers and economists believe China will be able to overtake the US to become the world&#8217;s largest consumer market this year.</p>
<p>While it is a relief to see the Chinese manufacturing sector show signs of recovery, there is no denying that the services sector has become a leading driving force for China&#8217;s economic growth. In 2018, the value gained from China&#8217;s services sector accounted for 52.2 percent of total GDP. The fact that it has become China&#8217;s biggest industrial sector has laid the foundation for China to advance toward the goal of developing a competitive services sector globally.</p>
<p>Moreover, whether or not China can cultivate a strong services industry also determines if it can further expand its consumer market and increase imports in the future. Only by making the Chinese market bigger and more promising can we enhance bargaining power in the international trade and economic systems. In that sense, upgrading the services sector in an all-round way is of great significance to China&#8217;s future trade environment.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that China is still far from being a services trade power. In 2018, China&#8217;s services trade deficit hit $292.2 billion, the highest in the world and accounting for 41 percent of the global trade services deficit. By comparison, although the US has the highest goods trade deficit in the world, it also possesses the largest services trade surplus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, China&#8217;s services sector and trade both have great potential. So does its huge consumer market. With the application of high technologies such as 5G, high-tech services industries like those concerning information transmission, software and information technology will see further development, contributing to the steady expansion of the Chinese consumer market &#8211; which the world cannot afford to lose.</p>

</div>
<p>India, with its 1.35 billion people aspiring to escape decades of poverty and become better off, has seen its economy rise at a galloping speed in the past few years. But the country is now headed into a strong headwind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot perennially bask in his landslide reelection win, as his government is embroiled in a whirlpool of global trade protectionism and a grave domestic economic slump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besieged by Washington&#8217;s wide-ranging tariff hikes and a precipitous decline of domestic spending, Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy grew just 4.5 percent in the July-September quarter this year, hitting a 26-quarter low. GDP growth was 7.1 percent in the same period last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slower growth will cause trouble for Modi&#8217;s government as people will grieve for lost jobs and shrinking wages. Also, a persistent sales lull will lead to the redundant capacity of textile machines, coal mines, steel mills and information technology services, which are major industries in India and at the same time crucial revenue sources for New Delhi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a sharply reduced growth rate and lower incomes, a middle class in India will hardly emerge. Without them, the country&#8217;s emerging urban property market will be disadvantaged, and the gloom will have chilling effect on the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As known to many, urban construction and a real estate boom are key to a major country&#8217;s economic take-off. It is particularly true for India, as more than 75 percent of the nation&#8217;s people still toil on farm. Only when half of these rural residents move to cities could India be called a fairly developed country.</p>
<p>When the quarterly growth rate of 4.5 percent was announced, Indian scholars, media pundits and figures from the opposition party bombarded Modi&#8217;s government. They said the magnitude of the slowdown was &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; and will seriously hamstring aspirations to grow India&#8217;s economy to $5 trillion from $2.72 trillion in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The task facing Modi and his cabinet is an arduous one that calls for the prompt readjustment of policies. Void of policy changes, India&#8217;s economic boat will have difficulty sailing through the rough seas, as other major Asian economies &#8211; including Japan and South Korea &#8211; have come to a de facto standstill because of US President Donald Trump&#8217;s trade wars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Delhi should raise the ceiling of its domestic debt and invest more in infrastructure projects. The Reserve Bank of India, the country&#8217;s central bank, needs to slash benchmark interest rates to lessen the financing burden of Indian businesses, so that the majoring of Indian enterprises can survive a drastic slowdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sharp meltdown of private consumption in India, from a 10.6 percent growth in January-March to a 3.1 percent rise in July-September, indicates that India&#8217;s economic engine has run into big trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Indian economists are worried that the fiscal deficit for the April-October period already hovers at an elevated 103 percent, which is the full-year target. But in such a time of global distress, raising the debt level is warranted. When the economic engine is sputtering, domestic priming is needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, Modi&#8217;s government needs to revise its geopolitical strategy of always following in the footsteps of the US government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By refusing to sign on to the RCEP trade pact and shutting its doors to China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, India has said no to free trade and free investment. Modi&#8217;s inward-looking foreign policy&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;putting China at arm&#8217;s length &#8211; will produce a lasting negative impact on its economic revival.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In comparison, the ever closer economic integration of Russia and China has created significantly broader opportunities for both countries.</p>
<p>Whether or not India will overcome its economic malaise and prevent itself from falling into the &#8220;middle-income trap&#8221; remains to be observed. Will India&#8217;s current economic storm dissipate on its own? Modi probably knows the answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All planes flying from Kathmandu to Lumbini in southwestern Nepal are air minibuses. Shortly after the aircrafts take off, what heaves in sight is usually undulating mountains on the edge of the mighty Himalayas. Only half an hour later, passengers could see an immense plain. It is a gateway to the core of Indian civilization. Google Maps shows the driving distance from Lumbini to New Delhi is about 800 kilometers.</p>
<p>Around 1500BC, Aryans from Central Asia invaded South Asia and occupied fertile lands in what is known today as the Ganges River Valley in India. Lumbini is located on the edge of this rich area, and Buddhism was born at this site in about 500BC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tour guide told me that Lumbini is less than 20 kilometers from the Indian border. Many China-made goods are sold in shops along the streets of nearby towns. People dressed in monk robes pass by from time to time. And in the birthplace of the Buddha, plenty of Chinese tourists can be seen.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese tourists visiting Nepal has increased phenomenally &#8211; from 5,160 in 2000 to 153,602 in 2018. And Lumbini is one of their major destinations. Zhong Hua Chinese Buddhist Monastery, with a history of more than 20 years, is the first national-level temple established overseas by the Beijing-based Buddhist Association of China.</p>
<p>As an increasing number of Buddhists from China, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asian countries visit Nepal&#8217;s Lumbini to show their respect and devotion for the Buddha, this small town, which was hardly heard of by the world for a long time in the 20th century, is now of geopolitical significance.</p>
<p>In 2011, Doha-based media Al Jazeera unveiled an unconfirmed plan of China, saying the East Asian country would invest $3 billion in Lumbini for infrastructure development. On September 19, 2013, Le Monde of France published an article, stating that the soft power competition between China and India in Lumbini was soundless but fierce as it might decide which country would become the leader of more than 400 million Buddhists of various denominations worldwide, including Mahayana and Hinayana.</p>
<p>The guide told me, based on the discovery of Indian and European archaeologists, the Indian side has confirmed that the ancient city of Kapilavastu located in present-day Piprahwa, India, was the homeland of Sakyamuni. Kapilavastu is only about 1 kilometer from the India-Nepal border line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Nepal identified present-day Tilaurakot in Nepal as the location of the historical site of Kapilavastu. In addition, legendary Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang who lived during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) recorded the Nepal-indentified location in his narrative. And there have been new findings in recent years.</p>
<p>Back to the times when Sakyamuni was alive, there wasn&#8217;t a border line. The invasion of British colonialists has left marks of &#8220;nation&#8221; in people&#8217;s mind, which can still be seen in many Asian countries. Hence, Lumbini, in addition to being a spiritual site, is also a political one. It could provide important clues for us to know present-day Asia.</p>
<p>The world heritage site is at the foot of the Himalaya mountains, which could hardly become an obstacle for people-to-people exchanges in Asia amid the advent of globalization. People from Lumbini can feel the tremendous changes that are taking place in the world. In the foreseeable future, railways and highways will cross the mountains and extend into Nepal to link the Buddhist pilgrimage site, the starting point of Buddhism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A railway that crosses China-Nepal border and links Xigaze in Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal&#8217;s capital Kathmandu is under construction. In the meantime, a railway that starts from the India-Nepal border and ends at Kathmandu is on the agenda of the Indian government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I was heading toward the airport and villages, fields, and trees passed by, I kept thinking: Does it mean China and India will shake hands at the birthplace of Buddhism if the two ancient civilizations are linked via Nepal?</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The Gwadar port in 2017 File photo: VCG </p>
<p>Pakistani officials have successively come forward to refute recent US criticism of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Why don&#8217;t Pakistani officials buy allegations of the CPEC&#8217;s &#8220;heavy debt burden?&#8221; Because they know that the US doesn&#8217;t really care about their country&#8217;s debt problems and that Washington is just trying to create obstacles for China-Pakistan cooperation.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to Pakistan&#8217;s Planning Minister Asad Umar, CPEC projects have added $4.9 billion in foreign loans, less than 7 percent of the total debt, which underlines the blindness of the US accusation. Geng Shuang, spokesperson for China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, said at a press conference on Monday that more than 80 percent of CPEC projects are funded by direct investment or grants from China, with less than 20 percent using Chinese loans.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Pakistan has a debt problem with its foreign borrowing totaling $74 billion. But growth is the only way for a country to reduce or eliminate a debt problem, and in that sense, the CPEC projects are fully in line with Pakistan&#8217;s development needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first phase of CPEC projects focused on infrastructure development, while the second phase is expected to concentrate on establishing special economic zones, which will support and boost Pakistan&#8217;s industrialization.</p>
<p>The CPEC is a flagship program of the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI). It is not the first time that the West has criticized the BRI for its debt risks, disregarding basic facts. So far, no country has fallen into any debt crisis because of engaging in BRI cooperation with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just common sense that whether a country encounters a debt crisis does not simply depend on how much it has borrowed. What really matters is whether the country can convert loans into assets that can generate effective returns and whether the loans promote the economic growth of the borrower and enhance its long-run, sustainable repayment ability. BRI cooperation is exactly the kind of investment that aims to improve the economic and trade development of countries and regions along the route through enhancing infrastructure connectivity and building industrial zones.</p>
<p>While some in Washington repeat&nbsp; clichés about debt connected with the CPEC or BRI, the US doesn&#8217;t take any concrete measures to help Pakistan with its economic development. It is regrettable that Washington will never understand how much some developing countries need BRI or similar programs to modernize and lift their people out of poverty.</p>

<p>In a discussion on the Palestinian issue at an international forum, former secretary-general of the Arab League Amr Moussa, who was the host, could not control the smell of the metaphorical gunpowder on stage. As sparks flew among the seven international figures from Palestine, Israel and European countries and hundreds from the audience joined in the debate, Moussa had to hastily end the discussion.</p>
<p>Raised under the long-term influence of Chinese culture, which encourages restraint in public, I was shocked by what had happened. A former European politician sitting next to me kept shaking his head disapprovingly. He whispered to me, &#8220;The Middle East issue is too complicated. China must not blend in.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a sincere advice for Chinese diplomacy! If Middle East stakeholders can&#8217;t even discuss issues peacefully, what would happen when they carry out formal negotiations?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grievances of the Middle East which go back more than 2,000 years are indeed more complicated than one can imagine, given all the historical contradictions, realistic interests, national disputes, economic differences, sectarian strife, ideological rifts, external interference, geopolitical games, and financial issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 1945, the US started to meddle in the Middle East and appeared to have become the largest external judge and coordinator among different parties in the region. In the past 70 years, in addition to the constant outbreak of wars and conflicts, tens of thousands of US soldiers have died in the Middle East. The problem is becoming more complicated and the US is making more and more enemies there.</p>
<p>The chaos in the Middle East is only one side of disorder in the world. Who can easily provide solutions for the economic, political, ethnic differences and chaos that exist in the vast regions of Central Asia, South Asia, Africa and Latin America? Setting problems in developing countries aside, there is even no short-term solution to social disorders of developed countries in Europe and North America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Global governance has reached its most complex period in history. It can be imagined how awkward it is for the US which has always been the world policeman. In my opinion, the logic of US President Donald Trump is: Don&#8217;t take on so many responsibilities and only care for the US. This is completely contrary to the US diplomatic tradition and is shocking the world.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, new ideas have emerged in the world &#8211; some people hope that China can replace the US to become the new global leader. However, I often tell some of my foreign friends not to expect too much from China. It is a developing country with a per capita GDP of only more than $9,000, more or less just one-sixth of that of the US. China has not yet walked out of the middle-income trap. China does not have that strength and foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has not yet acquired the experience and ability for a global leader. The complexity of the international situation is beyond the imagination of the Chinese people. For stark differences among different regions, Chinese diplomats and entrepreneurs have not accumulated the ability and skills to strike a balance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has neither the will nor the strategy to become a new global leader. Never seeking hegemony is the diplomatic policy of the Chinese government. In the eyes of the Chinese people, being a hegemonic power comes with a lot of responsibility but low returns. More importantly, it might hurt other countries in certain aspects. As Chinese President Xi Jinping said, the Chinese dream, a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, is by no means a dream of seeking hegemony. Mutual respect, consultation on an equal footing and mutual benefit are rules that China is pursuing for international interactions.</p>
<p>In recent years, China has proposed the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative and to build a community with a shared future for mankind. It has also proactively promoted BRICS mechanism, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries (also called the 17+1), the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1060150.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China-</a><br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a> cooperation and so on. All of this shows that China communicates and cooperates with the world more frequently. China is trying to present some Chinese-style experiences to the rest of the world. It has not forced other countries by any means. That being said, there is no need to encourage China to become the new international leader. It is not what China wants. If possible, other countries are welcome to study more about China&#8217;s development and learn from some of China&#8217;s effective governance.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>I was late thanks to the New York subway system&#8217;s less-than-stellar weekend service. When I rushed into the Junzi Kitchen at Times Square on a recent chilly night, panting and ready to throw out the now ubiquitous excuse any New Yorker would make in this situation, what struck me was not the embarrassment of being late for the dinner but the stark unfamiliarity of a casual fast food chain that I have visited several times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bustling food counter was nowhere to be seen &#8211; hidden behind a dark green velvet curtain like the backstage of a Broadway theater. The usual customers &#8211; bland office workers and somewhat louder tourists &#8211; had been replaced with a dozen or so fashionably dressed invited guests chatting in hushed tones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, not long after I was seated, we were served one of the most intriguing dishes of the night. &#8220;Nixon said this was the worst Chinese dish he had,&#8221; Lucas Sin, the chef, said, in a warning aimed mainly at Westerners there. The &#8220;three-colored egg&#8221; dish is made from smoked chicken egg, century egg and cured duck yolk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nixon? Yes, that Nixon, the former president of the US. The night&#8217;s menu said it all &#8211; a folded white card sealed by a red sticker with the words &#8220;Junzi Chef&#8217;s Study&#8221; and &#8220;Nixon in China&#8221; printed on the face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Richard Nixon&#8217;s 1972 ice-breaking visit to Communist China, which laid the foundation for the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries seven years later, is no doubt one of the most significant milestones in the history of diplomacy. But for US foodies, the gastronomic side effect of the trip is no less delectable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The image of the controversial president wielding chopsticks at the welcoming banquet hosted by former Chinese premier Zhou Enlai created an instant surge of business for Chinese restaurants in the US. The menu has since been replicated many times by different Chinese restaurants here. Each one tells a unique story of its own time, about food and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first such endeavor was probably by Michael Tong whose Shun Lee Palace in midtown Manhattan launched the same banquet menu provided for Nixon that same night for an astronomical (for Chinese food in those days) $25 a head. That was a time when Chinese restaurants in the US were about to see a boom as Americans were ready to embrace a few more Chinese dishes than the long lasting chop suey and chow mein invented by Chinese immigrants many years before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2011, when I went to talk to Tong as he revisited the menu to mark the debut of John Adams&#8217; opera Nixon in China at the Metropolitan Opera House, he was preoccupied. A labor shortage had developed thanks to China&#8217;s red-hot economic growth. There was no longer an influx of blue collar immigrants to staff Chinese restaurant kitchens. He was worried that if his chef left, it&#8217;d be hard for him to find a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But very soon things changed again. Now, an influx of young people &#8211; they initially come here to go to university &#8211; from wealthy families in China is rejuvenating the Chinese restaurant industry in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike their predecessors, they chose the profession out of a passion for food rather than the need to make a living. And the style of the restaurants they open can fit into any trendy district in the country. They are a long way from the backwaters of a Chinatown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sin, a 26-year-old Yale educated chef at Junzi is one. The noodle and Chinese wraps chain was founded in 2015 by three fellow Yale Chinese students Zhao Yong, Zhang Wanting and Bai Ming to sell traditional food from their hometowns in northern China. Well, that was the beginning. Now they are looking into purchasing traditional Chinese takeout and transforming their economics by automating kitchens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1972, the banquet in Beijing contained ingredients Westerners may find daunting, such as spongy bamboo shoots and century egg &#8211; preserved egg that has a strong aroma of sulfur. &#8220;Today the hard stuff is easy because we don&#8217;t need to watch the president eating to change our attitude about Chinese food,&#8221; said Sin. &#8220;You can just go to Junzi or other modern Chinese restaurants to try it yourself.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not that the sitting President Donald Trump would show off his chopstick skills anytime soon with the relationship between the two countries worsening again. But Sin&#8217;s words immediately proved true at our table. James, an architect sitting opposite me put his spoon into the three colored egg dish that looks like a combination of curd and jelly with bright yellow to dark brown hues. &#8220;Nixon was wrong,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;This is delicious.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we tried the notorious Chinese spirit, baijiu, chatted about how tomatoes were first brought to China and how a certain Chinese dish is similar to a Portuguese one. There might be something more important to talk about. But no one bothered. Intoxicated, my eyes caught a line in the menu: &#8220;This month, as we renew and recreate that menu, if only to ask the same question: &#8216;can Peking duck end a war?'&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What war? I must be drunk.&nbsp;</p>
