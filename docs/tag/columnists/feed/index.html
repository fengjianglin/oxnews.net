<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Zhong Hua Chinese Buddhist Monastery in Lumbini. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>All planes flying from Kathmandu to Lumbini in southwestern Nepal are air minibuses. Shortly after the aircrafts take off, what heaves in sight is usually undulating mountains on the edge of the mighty Himalayas. Only half an hour later, passengers could see an immense plain. It is a gateway to the core of Indian civilization. Google Maps shows the driving distance from Lumbini to New Delhi is about 800 kilometers.</p>
<p>Around 1500BC, Aryans from Central Asia invaded South Asia and occupied fertile lands in what is known today as the Ganges River Valley in India. Lumbini is located on the edge of this rich area, and Buddhism was born at this site in about 500BC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tour guide told me that Lumbini is less than 20 kilometers from the Indian border. Many China-made goods are sold in shops along the streets of nearby towns. People dressed in monk robes pass by from time to time. And in the birthplace of the Buddha, plenty of Chinese tourists can be seen.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese tourists visiting Nepal has increased phenomenally &#8211; from 5,160 in 2000 to 153,602 in 2018. And Lumbini is one of their major destinations. Zhong Hua Chinese Buddhist Monastery, with a history of more than 20 years, is the first national-level temple established overseas by the Beijing-based Buddhist Association of China.</p>
<p>As an increasing number of Buddhists from China, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asian countries visit Nepal&#8217;s Lumbini to show their respect and devotion for the Buddha, this small town, which was hardly heard of by the world for a long time in the 20th century, is now of geopolitical significance.</p>
<p>In 2011, Doha-based media Al Jazeera unveiled an unconfirmed plan of China, saying the East Asian country would invest $3 billion in Lumbini for infrastructure development. On September 19, 2013, Le Monde of France published an article, stating that the soft power competition between China and India in Lumbini was soundless but fierce as it might decide which country would become the leader of more than 400 million Buddhists of various denominations worldwide, including Mahayana and Hinayana.</p>
<p>The guide told me, based on the discovery of Indian and European archaeologists, the Indian side has confirmed that the ancient city of Kapilavastu located in present-day Piprahwa, India, was the homeland of Sakyamuni. Kapilavastu is only about 1 kilometer from the India-Nepal border line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Nepal identified present-day Tilaurakot in Nepal as the location of the historical site of Kapilavastu. In addition, legendary Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang who lived during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) recorded the Nepal-indentified location in his narrative. And there have been new findings in recent years.</p>
<p>Back to the times when Sakyamuni was alive, there wasn&#8217;t a border line. The invasion of British colonialists has left marks of &#8220;nation&#8221; in people&#8217;s mind, which can still be seen in many Asian countries. Hence, Lumbini, in addition to being a spiritual site, is also a political one. It could provide important clues for us to know present-day Asia.</p>
<p>The world heritage site is at the foot of the Himalaya mountains, which could hardly become an obstacle for people-to-people exchanges in Asia amid the advent of globalization. People from Lumbini can feel the tremendous changes that are taking place in the world. In the foreseeable future, railways and highways will cross the mountains and extend into Nepal to link the Buddhist pilgrimage site, the starting point of Buddhism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A railway that crosses China-Nepal border and links Xigaze in Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal&#8217;s capital Kathmandu is under construction. In the meantime, a railway that starts from the India-Nepal border and ends at Kathmandu is on the agenda of the Indian government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I was heading toward the airport and villages, fields, and trees passed by, I kept thinking: Does it mean China and India will shake hands at the birthplace of Buddhism if the two ancient civilizations are linked via Nepal?</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>In a discussion on the Palestinian issue at an international forum, former secretary-general of the Arab League Amr Moussa, who was the host, could not control the smell of the metaphorical gunpowder on stage. As sparks flew among the seven international figures from Palestine, Israel and European countries and hundreds from the audience joined in the debate, Moussa had to hastily end the discussion.</p>
<p>Raised under the long-term influence of Chinese culture, which encourages restraint in public, I was shocked by what had happened. A former European politician sitting next to me kept shaking his head disapprovingly. He whispered to me, &#8220;The Middle East issue is too complicated. China must not blend in.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a sincere advice for Chinese diplomacy! If Middle East stakeholders can&#8217;t even discuss issues peacefully, what would happen when they carry out formal negotiations?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grievances of the Middle East which go back more than 2,000 years are indeed more complicated than one can imagine, given all the historical contradictions, realistic interests, national disputes, economic differences, sectarian strife, ideological rifts, external interference, geopolitical games, and financial issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 1945, the US started to meddle in the Middle East and appeared to have become the largest external judge and coordinator among different parties in the region. In the past 70 years, in addition to the constant outbreak of wars and conflicts, tens of thousands of US soldiers have died in the Middle East. The problem is becoming more complicated and the US is making more and more enemies there.</p>
<p>The chaos in the Middle East is only one side of disorder in the world. Who can easily provide solutions for the economic, political, ethnic differences and chaos that exist in the vast regions of Central Asia, South Asia, Africa and Latin America? Setting problems in developing countries aside, there is even no short-term solution to social disorders of developed countries in Europe and North America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Global governance has reached its most complex period in history. It can be imagined how awkward it is for the US which has always been the world policeman. In my opinion, the logic of US President Donald Trump is: Don&#8217;t take on so many responsibilities and only care for the US. This is completely contrary to the US diplomatic tradition and is shocking the world.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, new ideas have emerged in the world &#8211; some people hope that China can replace the US to become the new global leader. However, I often tell some of my foreign friends not to expect too much from China. It is a developing country with a per capita GDP of only more than $9,000, more or less just one-sixth of that of the US. China has not yet walked out of the middle-income trap. China does not have that strength and foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has not yet acquired the experience and ability for a global leader. The complexity of the international situation is beyond the imagination of the Chinese people. For stark differences among different regions, Chinese diplomats and entrepreneurs have not accumulated the ability and skills to strike a balance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has neither the will nor the strategy to become a new global leader. Never seeking hegemony is the diplomatic policy of the Chinese government. In the eyes of the Chinese people, being a hegemonic power comes with a lot of responsibility but low returns. More importantly, it might hurt other countries in certain aspects. As Chinese President Xi Jinping said, the Chinese dream, a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, is by no means a dream of seeking hegemony. Mutual respect, consultation on an equal footing and mutual benefit are rules that China is pursuing for international interactions.</p>
<p>In recent years, China has proposed the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative and to build a community with a shared future for mankind. It has also proactively promoted BRICS mechanism, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries (also called the 17+1), the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1060150.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China-</a><br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a> cooperation and so on. All of this shows that China communicates and cooperates with the world more frequently. China is trying to present some Chinese-style experiences to the rest of the world. It has not forced other countries by any means. That being said, there is no need to encourage China to become the new international leader. It is not what China wants. If possible, other countries are welcome to study more about China&#8217;s development and learn from some of China&#8217;s effective governance.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>I was late thanks to the New York subway system&#8217;s less-than-stellar weekend service. When I rushed into the Junzi Kitchen at Times Square on a recent chilly night, panting and ready to throw out the now ubiquitous excuse any New Yorker would make in this situation, what struck me was not the embarrassment of being late for the dinner but the stark unfamiliarity of a casual fast food chain that I have visited several times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bustling food counter was nowhere to be seen &#8211; hidden behind a dark green velvet curtain like the backstage of a Broadway theater. The usual customers &#8211; bland office workers and somewhat louder tourists &#8211; had been replaced with a dozen or so fashionably dressed invited guests chatting in hushed tones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, not long after I was seated, we were served one of the most intriguing dishes of the night. &#8220;Nixon said this was the worst Chinese dish he had,&#8221; Lucas Sin, the chef, said, in a warning aimed mainly at Westerners there. The &#8220;three-colored egg&#8221; dish is made from smoked chicken egg, century egg and cured duck yolk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nixon? Yes, that Nixon, the former president of the US. The night&#8217;s menu said it all &#8211; a folded white card sealed by a red sticker with the words &#8220;Junzi Chef&#8217;s Study&#8221; and &#8220;Nixon in China&#8221; printed on the face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Richard Nixon&#8217;s 1972 ice-breaking visit to Communist China, which laid the foundation for the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries seven years later, is no doubt one of the most significant milestones in the history of diplomacy. But for US foodies, the gastronomic side effect of the trip is no less delectable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The image of the controversial president wielding chopsticks at the welcoming banquet hosted by former Chinese premier Zhou Enlai created an instant surge of business for Chinese restaurants in the US. The menu has since been replicated many times by different Chinese restaurants here. Each one tells a unique story of its own time, about food and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first such endeavor was probably by Michael Tong whose Shun Lee Palace in midtown Manhattan launched the same banquet menu provided for Nixon that same night for an astronomical (for Chinese food in those days) $25 a head. That was a time when Chinese restaurants in the US were about to see a boom as Americans were ready to embrace a few more Chinese dishes than the long lasting chop suey and chow mein invented by Chinese immigrants many years before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2011, when I went to talk to Tong as he revisited the menu to mark the debut of John Adams&#8217; opera Nixon in China at the Metropolitan Opera House, he was preoccupied. A labor shortage had developed thanks to China&#8217;s red-hot economic growth. There was no longer an influx of blue collar immigrants to staff Chinese restaurant kitchens. He was worried that if his chef left, it&#8217;d be hard for him to find a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But very soon things changed again. Now, an influx of young people &#8211; they initially come here to go to university &#8211; from wealthy families in China is rejuvenating the Chinese restaurant industry in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike their predecessors, they chose the profession out of a passion for food rather than the need to make a living. And the style of the restaurants they open can fit into any trendy district in the country. They are a long way from the backwaters of a Chinatown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sin, a 26-year-old Yale educated chef at Junzi is one. The noodle and Chinese wraps chain was founded in 2015 by three fellow Yale Chinese students Zhao Yong, Zhang Wanting and Bai Ming to sell traditional food from their hometowns in northern China. Well, that was the beginning. Now they are looking into purchasing traditional Chinese takeout and transforming their economics by automating kitchens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1972, the banquet in Beijing contained ingredients Westerners may find daunting, such as spongy bamboo shoots and century egg &#8211; preserved egg that has a strong aroma of sulfur. &#8220;Today the hard stuff is easy because we don&#8217;t need to watch the president eating to change our attitude about Chinese food,&#8221; said Sin. &#8220;You can just go to Junzi or other modern Chinese restaurants to try it yourself.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not that the sitting President Donald Trump would show off his chopstick skills anytime soon with the relationship between the two countries worsening again. But Sin&#8217;s words immediately proved true at our table. James, an architect sitting opposite me put his spoon into the three colored egg dish that looks like a combination of curd and jelly with bright yellow to dark brown hues. &#8220;Nixon was wrong,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;This is delicious.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we tried the notorious Chinese spirit, baijiu, chatted about how tomatoes were first brought to China and how a certain Chinese dish is similar to a Portuguese one. There might be something more important to talk about. But no one bothered. Intoxicated, my eyes caught a line in the menu: &#8220;This month, as we renew and recreate that menu, if only to ask the same question: &#8216;can Peking duck end a war?'&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What war? I must be drunk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, it is not doctrines that are dominating Latin American politics, but globalization. If we still use neoliberalism or any other concept invented by Western scholars to explain what Latin America is passing through, our understanding of the continent may not be right. We can only understand the problems of Latin American countries by observing them in an already globalized world, especially comparing them with Asian countries.</p>
<p>The fact is simple to understand: Globalization has increased the flow of goods and formed a complete industrial chain. A country will gradually retreat to the bottom of the global industrial chain if the length of its railways begins to decrease, factories start to close, consumer goods start to depend on import, manufacturing jobs are reduced and no one in the country is willing or able to become blue-collar workers. The country will become more vulnerable as it has to export raw materials to sustain its economy. Thus, it will be the first to become a victim of global recession.</p>
<p>According to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, China, Japan, South Korea, India, plus some Southeast Asian economies account for over 50 percent of total global manufacturing output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, of all Latin American countries, only Mexico and Brazil have relatively stronger manufacturing industries. But they respectively account for only 2 percent and 1 percent of global manufacturing output.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, Argentina&#8217;s manufacturing (value added) as a percentage of GDP fell from more than 40 percent in 1965 to less than 13 percent in 2018. Another turbulent country, Chile, fell from nearly 30 percent in the mid-1970s to 11 percent in 2018. The entire Latin American manufacturing industry is still shrinking.</p>
<p>When we lived in a period in which countries and regions were relatively independent, Brazil, Argentina and Chile were leading producers in the region, and could hence win more export orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as globalization accelerates, the competitiveness of Europe and the US continues to increase on the high-end, and the rise of East Asian countries on the middle and low ends also has a strong impact. With expanding globalization, as global industries are forged into a complete industrial chain, Brazil, Argentina and Chile will be replaced.</p>
<p>Globalization to date is more about alternatives. With capital, cheaper alternatives can always be found. The fierce inter-state competition results in winners replacing losers, who find it hard to get back to their position from where they have been derailed. So far, there have been no successful cases of deindustrialization followed by reindustrialization. US President Donald Trump is trying to achieve it, with grim prospects.</p>
<p>Reliance on exporting industrial and consumer goods and equipment has led to a profound change in the economic structure of Latin American countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mass labor forces have entered low-end businesses, and the possibility to transform into high-end manufacturing has declined. Latin American left-wing forces were prosperous when Asian manufacturing industry represented by China boomed.</p>
<p>The Left is known to offer more benefits to low-income people. Of course, this is not a question of what kind of doctrines, or whether left-wing or right-wing, should govern. Increasing social investment has been a common policy in Latin American countries since 2010. However, due to globalization, Latin American countries can access better and cheaper industrial and consumer products compared to those produced at home, which leads these nations to depend more on exporting energy and primary products in exchange of economic growth, and maintaining their European-style welfare system.</p>
<p>Amid the backdrop of a global economic downturn, especially Asian economic slowdown, they would be hit hard. A generous welfare system cannot sustain without the support of manufacturing. Rising unemployment could lead to social unrest &#8211; which is ravaging many Latin American countries that are now in the throes of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is difficult for an economy without factories to be sustainable. For developing countries, deindustrialization is also a source of instability. This has been a problem of unbalanced development brought about by globalization.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev delivers a speech during the 7th Global Baku Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan on March 14, 2019. Photo: IC</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine that Azerbaijan, a country that ranks above 90 in terms of area and population, has such a global appeal, if you haven&#8217;t taken part in Global Baku Forum. I almost thought President Ilham Aliyev was the leader of a superpower, when he stood in the center of more than 40 former presidents and prime ministers from more than 30 countries and posed with them for pictures at the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>Aliyev got elected to office for the first time in 2003. Within the next 10 years, Azerbaijan had thoroughly developed its oil economy with a 7-fold increase in citizens&#8217; income, and planned to build the world&#8217;s tallest building that would be 1050-meter tall. When you roam Pedestrian Street in the center of Baku, you will find similarities with Paris and the view along the Caspian Sea will remind you of the Shanghai Bund in China&#8217;s financial capital. Baku organized the European Games a few years ago. In 2016, it held Formula One, the world&#8217;s top racing event, and made this city with a population of only 3 million more cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>The Baku Forum was launched in 2013 during Aliyev&#8217;s third term. The forum invited dozens of political leaders to the conference every year. During the forum, the dialogues of civilizations brought together leaders of major world religions. The strategy of &#8220;Reviving the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/ReportsfromtheSilkRoad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silk Road</a>&#8221; was proposed to build a trade, energy, finance and logistics center between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea to link Eastern Europe and West Asia which would create a strategic fulcrum for the development of Azerbaijan. This is in line with the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative in the Central Asian western corridor.</p>
<p>It is not common for small developing countries to have such a broad strategic vision. Other countries which were not frequently reported by Western media &#8211; Bahrain, Uzbekistan, Hungary and Latvia &#8211; had similar big ideas. What&#8217;s more, some international companies, foundations and social scientists also had similar vision.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t underestimate any small country or non-state entity. In the post-G7 era, they&#8217;re coming. The world won&#8217;t be the one of G2 led by China and the US in the future, and the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/971038.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G20</a> may not be able to do as well. A few years ago, a pessimistic &#8220;G0&#8221; had been put forward and people believed that there would be no country that can dominate the future world.</p>
<p>It has been argued that globalization is faced with unprecedented difficulties and local or regional forces are growing. It might be more appropriate to use &#8220;Glocalization&#8221; or &#8220;Glo-regionalization&#8221; to indicate that &#8220;Globalization,&#8221; &#8220;Localization&#8221; and &#8220;Regionalization&#8221; have mixed influences on everyone and every place.</p>
<p>I would prefer calling it &#8220;Gn&#8221; which means neither China nor the US nor G20, but N kinds of forces instead of a single force that will influence or dominate different global events at various levels. These kinds of forces are not only traditional powers, but also regional ones (such as Azerbaijan), international organizations, non-governmental institutions, financial institutions, transnational corporations, opinion leaders, think tanks and media, etc. All of them form a cross overlapping international power network, blur the ownership of global authority, breach sovereign rights and interests, and weaken the traditional political structure.</p>
<p>Jorg Friedrich, a professor at the University of Munich in Germany, used the term &#8220;New Medievalism&#8221; to describe the situation, likening the current era to the Middle Ages with the coexistence of empire, kingdom, tribe, duke and church that guided international governance. But perhaps &#8220;Gn&#8221; is easier to understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gn&#8221; is like the operating system and apps in a smartphone. Although the world order (operating system) is still dominated by the nations of the Westphalia system, there are different areas and regional affairs dominated by different actors (apps).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Caucasus, Azerbaijan is very important; global wealth management is hugely influenced by Buffett&#8217;s thinking; in response to resolving climate change, a 16-year-old Swedish girl called Greta Thunberg seems to be a hero, and so on. Without the &#8220;operating system,&#8221; nothing will work. However, there are forces that constantly discover new &#8220;apps&#8221; or dominate new things in the old &#8220;apps.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the era of Gn, global governance has entered the &#8220;deep water&#8221; area. China is willing to contribute, but it can&#8217;t be as arrogant as the US. And Beijing doesn&#8217;t have the willingness or ability to become a new world leader or fill the leadership vacuum left by Washington. For China, the best way is to pursue win-win results and cooperation, not to become enemy to any forces, and to make efforts within its capabilities.</p>
<p>It is a period during which any power or anyone can play a leading role at any time. To be kind to others, not to bully others, and to pursue win-win results is a strategic choice to maximize the interests of all parties. So far, China has done a good job.</p>
