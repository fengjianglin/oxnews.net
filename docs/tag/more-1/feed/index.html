<p>Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng on Thursday summoned U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to lodge stern representations and strong protest against the United States signing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 into law.</p>
<p>&#8220;China strongly urges the U.S. to correct its mistake and make a fresh start, not to put the Act into effect, and immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs or interfering in China&#8217;s other internal affairs so as to avoid making further damages to bilateral ties and cooperation in important areas between China and the United States,&#8221; Le demanded.</p>
<p>As for the wrong move taken by the United States, China will take countermeasures in response and the U.S. must bear all the consequences that may ensue, he said.</p>
<p>The United States&#8217; signing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 into law is a severe interference in Hong Kong affairs, which are China&#8217;s internal affairs. It is also in serious violation of the international law and basic norms governing international relations. It is a gross hegemonic move, Le said, noting that the Chinese government and the people express strong indignation and firm opposition against it.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is part of China and Hong Kong affairs are China&#8217;s internal affairs, brooking no interference from any foreign government or force, he said.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has unswerving determination to defend national sovereignty, security and development interests, implement &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle and oppose any external force in interfering in Hong Kong affairs, Le stressed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suen Wai Kwan, an APL cartoonist from Hong Kong, showed his support for the rioters on his Facebook account that featured pro-violence photos and sarcastic remarks aimed at Hong Kong police and pro-establishment lawmaker Junius Ho.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jushou Comic in Guangzhou, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, reiterated its firm adherence to China&#8217;s &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle and opposes any attempt to split China, and the company will remove all of Suen&#8217;s works published on its platforms, according to the statement.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Disneyland will cancel this year&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Eve countdown party, its website said &#8211; another blow to the city&#8217;s tourism sector, which has been hard hit by months of violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;After evaluating the possible late night transportation situation, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort regrets to announce that the &#8216;Disney New Year&#8217;s Eve Countdown Party!&#8217; on December 31 will be cancelled,&#8221; the official website said. But the website said that countdown activities for hotel guests will still be held.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s tourism sector has been hit hard by months of persistent violence and vandalism, which have turned many tourists away.</p>
<p>According local media reports, the third-quarter tourist arrivals in Hong Kong fell 26 percent year-on-year to 11.9 million. In October, the decrease was more than 40 percent year-on-year. The situation got even worse in the first half of November, with inbound tourists falling more than 50 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>A travel consultant from China&#8217;s travel agency Ctrip surnamed Jiang told the Global Times on Wednesday that tourists&#8217; interest in Hong Kong has declined. &#8220;Not a single client has asked me about a Hong Kong travel package in the past four months even though the travel products are still available on our website.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group tours to Hong Kong fell by 90 percent recently, Lam Chi Ting, chairman of The Federation of Hong Kong Trade Unions in Tourism, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many travel agencies no longer promote Hong Kong as an ideal destination due to safety concerns, since more than 40 countries and regions have issued travel warnings about Hong Kong. Many tour guides in Kong Hong have had to take unpaid leave. We really hope that the government can take measures to stop the violence and crack down on riots,&#8221; Lam said.</p>
<p>Apart from Disneyland, many other celebrations for<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> and the New Year have also been canceled over safety concerns caused by the riots in the city, Liang Haiming, a Hong Kong-based economist, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a huge disaster for Hong Kong&#8217;s travel, hotel, services and catering industries,&#8221; he said, adding that &#8220;only when peace and social order are restored to Hong Kong can it draw tourists back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unemployment rate of related sectors such as retail, hotel and catering industries increased to 5 percent in October from 3.9 percent in the second quarter, local media reported.</p>

<p>Born in 1951, Chinese entrepreneur Liu Yonghao has witnessed most of the ups and downs since the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His company, New Hope Group, is one of the success stories among the raft of private enterprises that have grown alongside China&#8217;s reform and opening-up. From feed production to agricultural technology and food processing, it has more than 40 factories in operation or under investment in countries along<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> routes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the 70th anniversary to celebrate the founding of the PRC, Liu sat down with the Global Times to discuss his entrepreneurship journey and insights into private enterprises in China.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>&#8216;First pot of gold&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p>Liu is the youngest brother in a family of four children from Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province. In the 1970s, they all graduated from college. Believing their lives could be vastly improved, the siblings decided to aim high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Living standards at that time were quite low. We wanted to use our hands and our intelligence to create value and change our lives,&#8221; Liu told the Global Times.</p>
<p>So the four started their first company in 1980 in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan, which was to assembling and selling audio equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We worked well with the production team and already had produced a prototype, but the secretary of the people&#8217;s commune said we were capitalists. He said no one could have a joint venture with the production team,&#8221; Liu said the plan flopped.</p>
<p>Two years later, changes had taken place in the countryside &#8211; specialized households began to rise. Those households integrated specialized commodity production together with the family&#8217;s regular economy, which enabled autonomy and allowed them to keep revenue for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we couldn&#8217;t do it in the city, could we be a specialized household in the countryside? We could plant vegetables, raise quails, pigs and chickens,&#8221; Liu said. This time, their proposal was approved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having scrimped and saved 1,000 yuan ($142) &#8211; 17,250 yuan today adjusted for inflation &#8211; to get the business started by selling watches, bicycles and even their family&#8217;s belongings, the business was launched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By renting some land and raising chickens, pigs and quails, Liu said his &#8220;first pot of gold&#8221; came from raising quails. &#8220;We became the biggest quail breeding company in China,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the huge pressure Liu and his brothers bore was lack of funding. They borrowed money from relatives as banks at that time were reluctant to lend to individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of their rope, Liu and his brothers had to borrow more from their relatives. But at the end of the year, they could not pay them back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were so anxious that we almost jumped into the Minjiang River [in southwestern Sichuan]. Finally, we bit the bullet and we sold all the newborn chickens so we could pay our debts,&#8221; Liu said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, the company switched to livestock feed production, which makes a subsidiary of New Hope, New Hope Liuhe, still the biggest livestock feed production company in China today.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Recognition for entrepreneurs</strong></span></p>
<p>In 1993, the first entrepreneurs were selected to become members of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference and deputies to the National People&#8217;s Congress. Liu was among the first cohort, and he was invited to deliver a speech at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Titled &#8220;There is hope for private enterprises,&#8221; Liu said in his speech that at the time, many people were concerned about private enterprise: Do private firms have a future and hope? Are private firms doing any good? Should we have private firms?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I explained that I was an entrepreneur from the private sector and I don&#8217;t see anything wrong in being among this group.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In early 1992, late leader Deng Xiaoping had inspired the country as well as Liu, with the landmark speeches he gave on his Southern Tour, during which Deng visited manufacturing powerhouses in southern China.</p>
<p>&#8220;He [Deng] said that whether capitalist or socialist, development is the absolute principle. We should prioritize economic development as the central task. What was strongly advocated at that time was the private sector economy as a beneficial supplement to national economic construction, part of the socialist economic system,&#8221; Liu said. When he gave his own speech at the Great Hall of the People the following year, Liu said he was deeply touched as he remembered Deng&#8217;s words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need to elevate the status of Chinese enterprises on the world stage was reinforced when in 1998, Liu attended the World Economic Forum, dubbed the Winter<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special%20coverage/Davos-2015.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Davos</a>, in Switzerland, a global gathering of world leaders and entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He found there were lots of politicians from different countries and business leaders from international enterprises, but only a few Chinese enterprises were represented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;What left an impression on me was that only about five languages were used at the forum and Chinese wasn&#8217;t one of them. There were very few Chinese interpreters as well. It was difficult to communicate with other attendees since it was hard to find a Chinese interpreter,&#8221; Liu said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the situation has changed. &#8220;At the Davos Forum, more than half the topics relate to China. Chinese people are everywhere. People talk about China, pay attention to China, and write about China. Many Chinese corporations attend the forum,&#8221; he noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liu pointed out the number of Chinese firms that were listed on the Fortune Global 500 this year as evidence of the success of entrepreneurship in the country.</p>
<p>This year, 129 companies among the Global 500 companies are from China, 40 of which are private corporations, the Xinhua News Agency reported on September 26.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad and proud that Chinese private firms have begun to gain a foothold globally,&#8221; Liu said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of the core values of entrepreneurship, he believes they are hard work, learning, being enterprising and taking responsibility.</p>
<p>By responsibility, he said his company should continuously work on its products. The essential requirement of food manufacturing is always to focus on quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company pays close attention to environmental issues and makes efforts to achieve win-win cooperation among its staff and across all their supply chains.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are all our responsibilities. And there is a broader sense of responsibility. We are actively involved in poverty alleviation initiatives, and contribute to public welfare deeds,&#8221; Liu said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The prosperity of the country relies on every enterprise and every sector of the society. When every &#8216;cell&#8217; of society remains healthy and strong, the country will become strong,&#8221; he said. </p>

<p>The public debut of the Type-075 amphibious assault ship on Wednesday, only a few days ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, &#8220;has brought a more festive atmosphere,&#8221; according to a Chinese<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/2.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of National Defense</a> spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang made the remarks at a routine press conference on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch ceremony for the warship was held in Shanghai on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>According to Ren, a series of tests for the vessel will be carried out next. The schedule will follow the normal testing routine for weaponry and equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Military observers previously told the Global Times that the Type 075 would become an indispensable and fresh force in China&#8217;s modern naval warfare, especially for landing missions, and that China and the US are capable of making ships as powerful as the Type 075.</p>
<p>Also during the press conference, Ren revealed that although the scale of the military parade for the upcoming anniversary is larger than before with involvement of more personnel and equipment, the actual financial and material investment for the event has dropped significantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Training and relevant activities for the parade were carried out in a surgical and high efficient way to make sure that every penny and material was well spent, meeting thrifty requirements. Ren said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Major General Cai Zhijun, deputy director of the leading group office for the military parade, told journalists at the Tuesday press conference in Beijing that the parade would feature about 15,000 people, 59 phalanxes, 160 aircraft and 580 pieces of weaponry and equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parade will take about 80 minutes, and will be the largest in recent years, said Cai.</p>

<p>The latest pledge to open China&#8217;s financial markets, coming from the central bank governor, further sets apart the reform-minded economy from a group of economies, notably the US, that are addicted to backward thinking.</p>
<p>After having created an economic miracle, the nation, which is celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, has set its sights on powering up its economy through further opening-up, especially in the financial sector.</p>
<p>Gearing up for a financial market that allows for sufficient competition and that is aligned with the global market will surely sharpen the edge of the Chinese economy that has been encouraging direct financing to ease debt reliance.</p>
<p>Market access to the banking, securities and insurance sectors has been substantially eased, and restrictions on foreign shareholding in the financial sector will be lifted next year, Yi Gang, governor of the People&#8217;s Bank of China, the country&#8217;s central bank, told a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Figures revealed by Yi at the event featuring the 70th anniversary celebration show China&#8217;s potential for further financial deregulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are more than 4,500 banking sector financial institutions, more than 130 securities firms and north of 230 insurance firms in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nation&#8217;s financial sector has 300 trillion yuan ($42.22 trillion) in total assets, with banks accounting for 268 trillion yuan, topping the global list by asset size. The nation&#8217;s markets for bonds, stocks and insurance are the world&#8217;s second-largest.</p>
<p>There are 989 foreign bank branches and agencies operating in China, plus 13 foreign-invested brokerage firms and 57 foreign-invested insurers.</p>
<p>Decades of efforts have built a viable financial market in China from scratch and put in place an opening-up mechanism intended to engage foreign investors on an equal footing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is now well poised to go further down the road to open its financial market even wider to foreign investment, which might one day pit the nation against the US in the global equity market.</p>
<p>In a sign that China&#8217;s financial opening endeavor has gained greater international recognition, Chinese mainland shares have lately been included in more key global benchmarks.</p>
<p>With the government adamant about financial opening &#8211; the most recent move was the foreign exchange regulator&#8217;s announcement in September to scrap investment quotas under two programs to give overseas institutional investors full access to the nation&#8217;s equity market &#8211; China will arguably give the global market, which is riven by populism and protectionism, an idea on how to ensure shared, sustainable growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s record of accomplishment and its resolve to lead the way toward an open-minded globalized path is the key to correcting misguided thoughts on growth and development that would make some great again only at the cost of others.</p>

<p>Editor&#8217;s Note:</p>
<p></strong>70 years ago, when China was still in the ruins of war and buildings were waiting to be constructed, people did not expect that it would turn into an infrastructure giant so soon that is now even helping others to build bridges, ports and rails overseas.</p>
<p>The country did not stop at that hard-won level of achievement. Building on efforts, sweat and the innovation of millions of Chinese people, now, when new technologies such as 5G and AI are transforming the world and the way people live, the country is on its way to take the lead again in the new era. It seeks to bridge the world, and to promote joint development for the benefit of the world.</p>
<p>It was the development of infrastructure that dragged China forward, and it will also be infrastructure that does this in the future.</p>
<p><center><br />
 <center><br />
  <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-09-25/3cd335e1-1cd5-4ec9-9714-1cd90f19d292.jpg"><br />

<p></center><br />
<br />During its overall growth in the past 70 years, China&#8217;s achievements in infrastructure are its most obvious and they are recognized by the world. Such achievements can easily be seen through a slew of &#8216;world&#8217;s firsts&#8217; that the country has gained over recent decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Three Gorges Dam, the world&#8217;s biggest hydropower project in terms of electricity production; China&#8217;s South-to-North Water Diversion Project, the biggest water transfer project globally, which benefits 100 million people; the world&#8217;s longest pipelines, the giant West-East Gas Pipeline project with a length of 8,704 km; the world&#8217;s highest railway, The Qinghai-Tibet railway, with its highest point reaching an altitude of 5,072 m; the world&#8217;s longest cross-sea bridge, the 55 km-long Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge; and the world&#8217;s longest underwater tube tunnel at 6.7 km, to name but a few.</p>
<p>Notably, China also has the largest mileage of any high-speed railway in the world. By the end of 2018, the total mileage of the high-speed railway in service was 30,000 km, which accounted for more than two-thirds of the total mileage of high-speed railways in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to media reports, 2.98 billion passenger trips were made during the 40-day Spring Festival travel rush in 2019. Trips taken country-wide within one year could circle the earth seven or eight times if they were placed one after another in a line.</p>
<p>And that mileage is still far from fulfilling domestic demand, particularly during the holidays when people have to scramble for tickets home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China aims to put a further 3,200 km of high-speed rail lines into operation in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Hard-earned achievements</strong></p>
<p>When new China was founded in 1949, it was in chaos after decades of war. Highways, railways…the transportation infrastructure began almost entirely from scratch and developed with an astonishing speed into what can be seen today, Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>From 1949 to 2018, the country&#8217;s transport network saw notable expansion. By the end of 2018, the total railway operation mileage reached 131,000 km, five times higher than in 1949, according to a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).</p>
<p>Inland waterways have expanded 72.7 percent to 127,000 km in mileage, while civil aviation flight routes surged 734 times from the figure in 1950, to 8.38 million km in 2018.</p>
<p>Telecom networks also reported fast expansion. The number of postal service branches increased 9.4 times over the seven decades, reaching 275,000 across the country. China&#8217;s mobile broadband network users topped 1.31 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>Starting from almost zero to the world&#8217;s major infrastructure power today, such achievements do not come from nowhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were built upon the years of efforts and hard work from millions of Chinese citizens who were willing to make selfless contributions.</p>
<p>The CRRC Qingdao Sifang Rolling Stock Research Institute Co (CRRC SRI), which provided key technologies for Beijing&#8217;s first metro train and China&#8217;s first double-deck passenger train, is among the companies that made China into the major infrastructure power that it is today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has played an important technical supporting role in China&#8217;s six large-scale railway speed-up projects, and has independently developed an air-conditioning oxygen supply system, an electrical system and air springs for Qinghai-Tibet trains, to assist Chinese trains to run safely on the &#8220;roof of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the founding of our company 60 years ago, we have always insisted on independent innovation, providing core systems and key products for the rail transit industry. Our many core technologies, such as traction converters, couplers and draft gear, the anti-vibration system, and TCMS, have been applied to China&#8217;s Standard EMU and the &#8216;Fuxing&#8217; EMU,&#8221; the head of CRRC SRI told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, we have applied technology innovation for high-speed trains to the urban rail field, which is the first time China has achieved the integration of the three systems of traction, network and braking, and on this basis has built intelligent trains.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s infrastructure development has not slowed after the achievements that have been made thus far. In the future, with the rolling out of regional jets and domestically manufactured large aircrafts, China will usher in an upsurge in the aviation industry, including the new rail transit which has been developed and is in full swing in China, according to Tian.</p>
<p>&#8220;While China has built a strong infrastructure team, it has also developed its own construction machinery and equipment, which utilizes technology that is in a leading global position. China does not simply use manpower to complete bridge construction projects as we see in videos on the internet, but uses a lot of domestic and large mechanical equipment. And the quality, the technology and the cost performance are competitive around the world,&#8221; Tian said.</p>
<p><strong>Linking the world</strong></p>
<p>With its world-leading infrastructure building capacity, China is now eyeing overseas markets in an effort to link the world with its capabilities in the sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is now the largest country receiving orders for infrastructure projects overseas, ranking first in the world for more than ten years in a row. The value of orders every year exceeds hundreds of billions of US dollars,&#8221; Tian said.</p>
<p>The<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI), proposed by China in 2013, aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe, Africa and beyond. It is a vivid example of how China can connect the world with its infrastructure experience.</p>
<p>After years of unremitting effort, the BRI has seen numerous achievements. With increasing collaboration on ports, railways, highways, electricity, aviation and communications, infrastructure development along the Belt and Road has been effectively upgraded, with better-than-expected results.</p>
<p>Additionally, ports are better connected than other transportation facilities between China and other nations along the Belt and Road. China maintains the top worldwide ranking in maritime connectivity, with shipping routes connecting its ports to over 200 nations and 600 major ports.</p>
<p>As for railway connections, the cumulative number of trips made by China-Europe freight trains exceeded 12,000 in 2018, with annual shipments reaching $16 billion, compared with only 17 trips and less than $600 million in 2011.</p>
<p>Total trade between China and other BRI countries amounted to $6.47 trillion over the 2013-18 period. More than 80 overseas economic and trade cooperation zones were built, and more than 244,000 jobs created for locals.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge to the future</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the intelligent era, Tian again stressed the importance of infrastructure capacity as it also provides an important foundation for China to realize industrialization and urbanization in the future, led by information technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, no matter whether it is China or the US, if anyone wants to reindustrialize, there is no platform to support it without technology in infrastructure,&#8221; Tian said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should also watch construction in the information age, including intelligent manufacturing and smart city construction, which are not the same as in the past. For example, high-speed communication [systems] like 5G, cloud computing, cloud servers, and dispersion of data stored in huge clouds, artificial simulation and artificial intelligence (AI). China has also seen good achievements in these fields of infrastructure,&#8221; Tian said.</p>

<p>Major General Luo Yuan was born one year after the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) was founded on October 1, 1949.</p>
<p>He has witnessed all the triumphs and tribulations that the nation has gone through.</p>
<p>Luo told the Global Times that his generation has forged an indissoluble bond with the country. Even their names are closely related to the republic and bear the imprint of the times.</p>
<p>Luo Yuan&#8217;s childhood name was Luo Jiansheng, which means &#8220;born during the country&#8217;s founding.&#8221; When he started going to school, he was called Luo Yuan, because &#8220;Yuan&#8221; means &#8220;aid,&#8221; referring to the period during the Korean War (1950-53) when China provided assistance to<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>.</p>
<p>Luo Yuan&#8217;s life has basically followed the path set out by his father Luo Qingchang, former head of China&#8217;s intelligence department &#8211; the investigation department of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>&#8220;I inherited the red gene which focused my mind on protecting our family and country, and embraced the spirit of revolution,&#8221; Luo told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Luo has been through ups and downs in his life, which are closely tied to those of the PRC. However, two wars had left the deepest impression on him.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>On the battlefield</strong></span></p>
<p>One was the fight against the US to help Laos and Vietnam. In the 1960s and 1970s, Luo fought in support of Laos as a member of the military working group in Vietnam and Laos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before going abroad, everyone was permitted to write a few words to their family, but could not reveal their whereabouts, Luo told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Luo wrote a sentence from an ancient poem which his father had taught him, &#8220;A loyal warrior&#8217;s bones are buried everywhere under green mountains, what is the use for horse leathers to wrap up new corpses?&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought my parents would know where I was if I sent the poem home. I didn&#8217;t reveal what I was doing, but they knew I was serving my country,&#8221; Luo noted, &#8220;People always ask how many times we can fight in our life. I could say that I fought once on the battlefield for the country!&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Empowering the country</strong></span></p>
<p>The second war that left an impression on Luo was the Kosovo war. Soon after the end of the conflict, the PLA Academy of Military Sciences organized a delegation to visit the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia before its disintegration, Luo felt a sense of sadness and indignation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a sovereign country battered by a hegemonic power. Buildings had been decimated,&#8221; he told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Luo and the delegation went to the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia to pay their respects to Chinese martyrs who died in the war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they laid a wreath in front of the embassy, all the soldiers shed tears. &#8220;We feel that it is our soldiers&#8217; mission to defend the dignity of our country. To lag behind is to be beaten, that is really a kind of pain,&#8221; Luo said.</p>
<p>After that, Luo went back to the academy and became more consciously engaged in the study of military theory, particularly the study of the modern military theory of war.</p>
<p>Soon after his return from former Yugoslavia, Luo had the opportunity to go to the US as a visiting scholar. He once attended a conference of the Atlantic Council, where US general and former head of NATO command, Europe, Wesley Clark, was giving a presentation.</p>
<p>In Clark&#8217;s report on the mission, he talked about how well the US had coordinated in the Kosovo war, and how precisely its weapons were used.</p>
<p>At the end of the Q&amp;A session, Luo stood up and asked, &#8220;You talked about how perfect your joint operations were and how accurate your weapons were, but I wonder how could you blow up our embassy in the former Yugoslavia if you were so accurate?&#8221;</p>
<p>The audience was in an uproar and Luo could see that Clark was embarrassed.</p>
<p>At that moment, another general came to the rescue, saying his question was very reasonable. But he also hoped that the Chinese scholar would look forward, as lingering on the issue would bring no further development between China and the US.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Peaceful growth</strong></span></p>
<p>China&#8217;s national defense capability is one of the strongest in the world, but some people perceive this as a Chinese military threat. From Luo&#8217;s perspective, it is not a threat, but the growth of a peaceful force.</p>
<p>Luo believes the reason why there has been no serious war in the world is that China&#8217;s national defense has played a major balancing role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;But to be honest, we are not a first-class army yet. We are aiming to become a world-class military by the middle of this century,&#8221; Luo told the Global Times.</p>
<p>He noted a strong country must have a strong military and having a weak military means that the country is at best a rich country and will never become a strong one.</p>
<p>&#8220;A strong national defense ensures the dignity of the nation. Only when soldiers stand with dignity can China develop with dignity,&#8221; Luo said.</p>
