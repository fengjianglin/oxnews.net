<p>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the six-month of chaos in Hong Kong, rioters have spread a lot of rumors trying to mislead the international community. The Global Times compiled some of these rumors and held them to scrutiny with a timeline of major events in the unrelenting 2019 riots that have paralyzed Hong Kong. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Rumor</strong></span></p>
<p>Hong Kong police were blamed for the death of 15-year-old Chan Yin-lam whose naked body was found floating in the sea off Yau Tong on September 22.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some posts even claimed she was raped and killed by Hong Kong police, calling for strong condemnation of &#8220;police brutality.&#8221; Some protesters and supporters of anti-government movement called it a &#8220;humanitarian crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Truth</strong></span></p>
<p>After an investigation, the Hong Kong police found that Chan&#8217;s death was a suicide and she had not been arrested at anti-government protests. However, some protesters who ignored the facts and evidence shown by surveillance camera footage continued spreading rumors regarding the girl&#8217;s death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chan&#8217;s mother, surnamed Ho, said in an interview with Hong Kong broadcaster TVB that she wanted to clarify that her daughter took her own life and was not killed by anyone elese.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chan&#8217;s mother also denied her daughter&#8217;s death is related to the latest protests and asked the public not to speculate on this tragedy. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Rumor</strong></span></p>
<p>Rioters claimed that women protesters were assaulted and gang raped by police officers while being detained at the San Uk Ling Holding Center. On September 27, protesters assembled at Edinburgh Place to voice support for detainees at the center under the pretext of mistreatment by police officers. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Truth</strong></span></p>
<p>Cheung Po-yuet, Chief Inspector of Family Conflict and Sexual Violence Policy Unit at the Hong Kong Police Force, rebutted those allegations in October, saying that police have not received any complaint of sexual assault related to the San Uk Ling Holding Centre or Kwai Chung Police Station. The police also appealed to any &#8220;victim&#8221; to provide concrete evidence so that police can launch a transparent fact-finding investigation as soon as possible. However, no one came forward to the police to report any specific case. During a dialogue held at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) on the night of October 10, a student claimed that, after being arrested, she was sexually assaulted by police officers while being detained at the San Uk Ling Holding Center. She later changed her story and said it took place at&nbsp; the Kwai Chung Police Station. Such contradictory claims cast doubt over the authenticity of her allegations. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Rumor</strong></span></p>
<p>Rumors claimed a police officer chased and pushed Alex Chow Tsz-lok, a student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), causing him to fall from third to second floor of Sheung Tak Estate car park on November 4. Chow later died after suffering a severe brain injury. Protesters also blamed the police for delaying an emergency medical response for 20 minutes. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Truth</strong></span></p>
<p>According to the released footage, Chow was wandering alone in a car park. The police also provided a detailed timeline about what happened before and after Chow&#8217;s fall. Chow showed up in a black shirt at the car park during a clash between rioting protesters and police nearby, and unveiled messages confirm that he acted as a sentinel using his Parkour skills to report police actions. There was a testimony from Chow&#8217;s friend that provides a clue to when Chow lost contact with his friends. However, as footage showed during this moment, there was no police present at the scene. The police came to the car park before Chow arrived and later came after he fell from the building, according to the footage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ambulance sent to treat Chow was not delayed due to the police. It was repeatedly blocked by road blocks set by black-clad rioters that night. Rioters set up bricks and road barricades as a way to hinder police. The ambulance had to make several detours to arrive at the scene. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Rumor</strong></span></p>
<p>A woman sustained a serious eye injury during an anti-government protest on August 11 at Tsim Sha Tsui. Protesters blamed police for shooting her in the eye with a beanbag round, making her an icon for the fight against so-called &#8220;police brutality.&#8221; </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Truth</strong></span></p>
<p>The police deny blame for the woman&#8217;s eye injury and clarified after the incident that there is no evidence that shows the cause of this incident was related to the police. Some officials also suggested the woman might have been hit by a projectile fired by rioters. However, the woman did not report the incident to police, and Hong Kong police had to apply for search warrant to access her medical record to investigate the cause of the injury. A police lawyer has accused the woman of impeding the investigation by seeking to access the warrants police used to obtain her medical records. The cause of her injury is still unknown.</p>

<p>On November 15, the HKSARG announced GDP in the region will drop by 1.3 percent compared with 2018.</p>
<p>In the third quarter of 2019, Hong Kong&#8217;s GDP saw a decline of 3.2 percent compared with the previous quarter, and suffered a year-on-year decrease of 2.9 percent.</p>
<p>Bernard Aw, the principal economist at IHS Markit, a London-based global information provider, pointed out that unless a remarkable recovery occurred in the fourth quarter, Hong Kong&#8217;s GDP will decrease by 5 percent.</p>
<p>According to the HKSARG, retail sales decreased by 24.3 percent in October compared with the same period in 2018.</p>
<p>Tourists to Hong Kong decreased by 43.7 percent in October compared with the same period in 2018.</p>
<p>Paul Chan Mo-po, Financial Secretary of HKSARG, said on December 2 that the regional government will see its first financial deficit by March 2020 in 15 years.</p>
<p>Hotel occupancy remains 60 percent under capacity due to the impact of the chaos in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate in the Hong Kong catering industry increased to 6.1 percent.</p>

<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry voiced strong opposition to the signature of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act by the US, which seriously interferes in the internal affairs of China and violates international laws and basic principles of foreign relations.</p>
<p>The White House on Wednesday signed the act, a move set to complicate the ongoing trade talks between China and the US as the US president is likely to selectively implement the act’s provisions by evaluating trade negotiations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such an act is abominable in nature and reveals vicious intentions of the US to sabotage the stability and prosperity of HK and disrupt the progress in China’s national rejuvenation, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump announced he had signed the act into legislation on Wednesday, according to a statement.&nbsp;<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chinese analysts who closely observe the Hong Kong situation told the Global Times that “the signature of the act is not out of our expectations,” as the US would “swim with the current” while adding more legal tools to contain China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill was passed in both chambers of Congress, showing that the hawkish political power in Washington is strong, Tian Feilong, associate professor at Beihang University in Beijing, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trump lacks the political power to veto the bill, while it’s believed that a veto is unnecessary. The signature is within expectations,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> <br />
<center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-09-20/c8b2e103-0527-494d-85c1-1cbe1d3ae046.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>However, the US president may selectively implement provisions of the act as leverage for ongoing trade negotiations, but he may also hold sanctions that are unfavorable for the talks, the analyst noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By emphasizing that the US president reserves the right to exercise this legislature, it is implied that Trump is dissatisfied with politicians in Congress who interfere with his own foreign affairs authority, “and he pledged to reserve the right to make further moves in accordance with the law,” Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan studies at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government said it strongly opposes the signature of the bill, which meddles in China’s internal affairs, according to a statement issued on Thursday morning. The bill is unnecessary and groundless, and will damage exchanges between the region and the US, the statement showed.</p>
<p>The act was signed after the US ignored warnings from the Chinese authorities. In an unprecedented move, seven Chinese institutes – the National People&#8217;s Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference, the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Liaison Office of the Chinese Central People&#8217;s Government in the Hong Kong SAR, the Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, and Hong Kong SAR government – last week condemned the bill passed by Congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US is adding weight to its attempt to fully contain China by signing the bill. It means that the US would officially interfere into Hong Kong affairs, which China does not want to see, Fan Peng, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences&#8217; Institute of Political Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US intends to use Hong Kong as a political card, just like<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a>, to force China to sign extremely unfair agreements in the trade negotiations. By doing so the US can interfere in China’s domestic affairs from all sides, including its judicial system, Fan said, noting that the US will by no means succeed.</p>

<p>The US Congress&#8217; passage of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is typical &#8220;long-arm jurisdiction&#8221; that violates the basic norms governing international relations, Lawrence Tang Fei, a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States attempted to use the act to threaten the administration of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), weaken the central government&#8217;s governance over the HKSAR and further contain China&#8217;s development by messing up Hong Kong,&#8221; said Tang, who is also the principal of Hong Kong&#8217;s Heung To Secondary School (Tseung Kwan O).</p>
<p>The Hong Kong society has been plunged into chaos and extremist violence continued to escalate after the now-withdrawn ordinance amendments concerning fugitives&#8217; transfers sparked unrest in Hong Kong in June.</p>
<p>Against such backdrop, the passage of the act will further encourage rioters and their violent activities, said Tang, adding that such an act is a product of long-standing collusion between anti-China people seeking to disrupt Hong Kong and some anti-China forces in the United States.</p>
<p>For anti-China people seeking to disrupt Hong Kong, the relevant act could provide an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; for them, and for the anti-China political forces in the United States, the act could serve as an important means to contain China by disrupting Hong Kong, he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has further expanded the extent of political freedom, democratic rights and implementation of the rule of law; while when Hong Kong was under the British colonial rule, the governors were entitled to absolute power over execution, legislation and jurisdiction,&#8221; Tang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some opposition media and politicians in Hong Kong with ulterior motives turned a blind eye to such positive changes and confounded right and wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And some young people were born and raised up after Hong Kong&#8217;s return to the motherland in 1997, thus have no experience of living under the colonial rule, and it is ridiculous for them to think that the Hong Kong people were given more freedom and democracy in the colonial era,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The act proposed to review Hong Kong&#8217;s special trading status based on annual assessment. However, Tang pointed out that Hong Kong&#8217;s unique economic status is not a boon gifted by any foreign governments, rather it is fundamentally granted by the national Constitution, the Basic Law and the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle, and its economic status is widely recognized by the international community.</p>
<p>Tang stressed that using relevant acts to impose sanctions on the HKSAR government officials and lawmakers is purely &#8220;long-arm jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Interfering in the domestic affairs of other countries by enacting its own domestic laws that proceed from its own national interests in disregard of the sovereignty of other countries is typical hegemonistic logic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The United States has major stakes in the financial and trading sectors in Hong Kong, Tang said, adding that the passage of the act by both US House of Representatives and the Senate will severely affect the mutually beneficial and cooperative relations.</p>
<p>The act would only serve as a &#8220;double-edged sword,&#8221; he said, adding that should the United States persist in its own way, the US business interests in Hong Kong were bound to be harmed.</p>
<p>Since the chaos hit Hong Kong, some Western media and politicians have deliberately glossed over the rioters&#8217; extremist violence while ignoring the professionalism and restraint of Hong Kong police, which resulted in Western community&#8217;s lack of comprehensive and objective knowledge, or even misconception of the riots and violence in Hong Kong, Tang added.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible and purely wishful thinking that they can bludgeon the central government into compromising on issues of principle by destroying and messing up Hong Kong,&#8221; Tang said, referring to those anti-China people who are creating chaos in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither should they hold illusions that their violence could win some so-called sympathy or support from the West,&#8221; Tang added. &#8220;If riots continue, it will only wreak havoc on Hong Kong&#8217;s rule of law, social and economic development and people&#8217;s welfare.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Tuesday lodged stern representations over a Reuters&#8217; report published earlier Tuesday and urged the British outlet to immediately stop spreading false information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The office statement did not name the Reuters report in question. However, it came soon after a report citing &#8220;people familiar with the matter&#8221; regarding the setup of a &#8220;crisis command center on the mainland side of the border&#8221; and government consideration of replacement of the Liaison Office of the Central People&#8217;s Government in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan affairs at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times that this was not the first time for the Western media to create some fake news about Hong Kong and &#8220;people familiar with the matter&#8221; was becoming a common source for those media outlets.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is absolutely a public opinion war. What they [Western media and foreign forces] want is to create rumors and fears among Hong Kong society, and they want to see China&#8217;s governance over the city decrease and even experience an &#8216;earthquake&#8217;,&#8221; said Tian Feilong, an associate professor at Beihang University in Beijing and a member of the Beijing-based Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies.</p>
<p>The office spokesperson reiterated that Hong Kong affairs are purely internal to China, and no matter how the Hong Kong situation develops, the Chinese government is rock-firm in defending national sovereignty, security and development interests, in implementing &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; and in opposing any external interference in Hong Kong affairs.</p>
<p>Maybe the central government should consider sending liaison officials to get in touch with the newly elected district council members who are not extreme and try to change them, some Chinese analysts suggested, since this could prevent these people from embracing the West.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, remarked that China resolutely opposes and condemns the recent passage of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 by the US Congress, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
<p>Yang said that the Chinese side has expressed its solemn position over the issue to the US side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese side urges the US to immediately stop interfering in China&#8217;s internal affairs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And any US attempts to use Hong Kong-related matter to interfere in China&#8217;s internal affairs, any plot to contain China&#8217;s development, will not succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hong Kong with robust mainland support will maintain its prosperity and stability in the long term, Yang noted.</p>
<p>Li said that Hong Kong is an international city of interest to many major powers around the globe and so it was also easy for foreign forces to interfere in the city affairs, especially the US. In the past, as the China-US relationship was more cooperative than competitive, the city could remain peaceful and stable despite experiencing some unrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;But now the situation is totally changed,&#8221; Li said. &#8220;China-US ties are getting increasingly intense and competitive, and the city will surely become a battle zone for the great power struggle between Beijing and Washington, and it won&#8217;t stop in the short term.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated Monday that Hong Kong is a part of Chinese territory, a Chinese special administrative region, while underscoring that any attempts to create chaos in the city and to damage its stability and prosperity will not succeed.</p>
<p>Wang made the remarks in response to a media request during his visit in Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Candidates from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress bow to apologize for their defeat in the local district council election in Hong Kong on Monday. Photo: AP</p>
<p>While pan-democrats scored a big win in the 2019 Hong Kong District Council elections on Sunday, the pro-establishment group and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government called for a thorough introspection of deep-rooted social issues while saying the election was &#8220;entangled with emotion,&#8221; which has also been highly politicized amid the ongoing social unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pan-democrats won 388 seats against the 63 of the pro-establishment camp and took control 17 of the city&#8217;s 18 district councils, Hong Kong&#8217;s Cable News Channel reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The elections were the first held since the anti-government protests that have turned increasingly violent in the past few months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starry Lee Wai-king, chairperson of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress (DAB), the largest pro-establishment group of Hong Kong, apologized on Monday morning following the opposition&#8217;s landslide victory. DAB representatives also claimed that the party will reflect on its failure. However, the election came at a very challenging time, as some of its offices were damaged and volunteers attacked amid rising social tensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Monday morning that the SAR government respects the result of the elections, which reflected the dissatisfaction of Hong Kong residents with deep-rooted social issues. And she said the government will &#8220;listen carefully&#8221; to the opinions of citizens.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s elections were held amid months of anti-government protests, with both the number of registered voters and voter turnout reaching record highs. Polling stations closed at 10:30 pm on Sunday and according to the official data, voter turnout was confirmed at 71.2 percent of 4.1 million registered voters, compared to 47 percent in the 2015 polls, and surpassed the previous record of 58 percent in the 2016&#8217;s Legislative Council elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ongoing social tensions made public opinion expression highly sentimental,&#8221; Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan studies at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>The public is dissatisfied with the efforts of the HKSAR government and the pro-establishment camp that supports the government. As a result, the public&#8217;s judgment and evaluation of the local government were reflected in the elections result, Li said. </p>
<p>Tang Fei, a member of the council of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times that the pro-establishment camp still secured 40 percent of the votes, which means there is no need to over-interpret the victory of pan-democrats, and under the plurality voting system of the district council elections, the opposition won 80 percent of seats with only 60 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Among the more than 1,000 candidates vying for 452 seats in the district councils of the Hong Kong, about 320 were from pro-establishment parties and more than 390 from pan-democratic groups. Over 370 candidates claimed to be &#8220;independent,&#8221; while the remainder did not provide their political affiliation.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the future, the pro-establishment camp should hold onto the 40 percent of votes, and seek support from the population that did not vote this time,&#8221; said Tang.</p>
<p><strong>Politicized elections</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With such a high voter turnout, coupled with the opposition&#8217;s propaganda, the opposition is trying to seek support from Western governments and their people, Tang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahead of the district council elections, the US Congress passed the Human Rights and Democracy Act, which is believed to be external forces exerting a certain influence on upcoming elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While some Western media referred to the elections as a referendum on HKSAR government, some political representatives and observers said opposition forces intended to exaggerate the influence of the elections, raising questions about whether they would exert more impact on politics at a higher level with the support of foreign forces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tang believes that the opposition will quickly exert pressure on the Hong Kong police regarding their siege of the Polytechnic University and form a united alliance of district councils to bargain with the HKSAR government, and even the central government, over their so-called five demands.</p>
<p>They may also ask European countries to pass human rights and democracy bills to garner support from the international community and urge the chief executive to step down. They will also demand that the central government reform the election committee as part of their political agenda.</p>
<p>Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, when asked about the election results during a visit to Japan on Monday, said that no matter what happens, Hong Kong is part of China and any attempt to destabilize Hong Kong or damage Hong Kong&#8217;s prosperity and stability is doomed to fail.</p>
<p>Following the elections, it remains a real test for elected pan-democratic councillors as to whether their community work will override their political stance, Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the National People&#8217;s Congress Standing Committee, told the Global Times. &#8220;Public opinion could be easily influenced or shifted depending on their real work of serving the public on a community basis,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they do not serve the people wholeheartedly, they would be abandoned by the electorate, observers said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reflection needed</strong></p>
<p>Hao Shinan, an expert at Shanghai International Studies University, who observes Hong Kong affairs, said that the pro-establishment camp&#8217;s defeat was caused by issues related to the election cycle under a special political climate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said this does not mean the pro-establishment camp cannot make a comeback, or if the just-concluded elections foreshadow the results of next year&#8217;s Legislative Council elections.</p>
<p>The pro-establishment camp should remain calm and composed, and seek to cultivate ties at the grassroots level, which is where the party&#8217;s traditional edge lies, rather than focus on mobilization and election strategies, Hao noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On major issues, pro-establishment parties should stand firm and remain confident in expressing their views, such as saying &#8220;no&#8221; to violence and supporting legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, Hao said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should also focus on rallying support from young people to change its traditional image, Hao noted.</p>
<p>Observers noted that the elections showed the obvious disadvantages of the pro-establishment camp, who either couldn&#8217;t or didn&#8217;t know how to communicate with younger residents. In the future, they should strengthen youth outreach efforts, and effectively respond to their demands, as it would bring hope to Hong Kong&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>Some pointed out that the overwhelming support for anti-government forces showed that Hong Kong has been moving away from the central government, as some radical activists, even secessionists, won public support in the elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been some misunderstanding about relations between Hong Kong and the central government. However, &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; will always be the top guideline for both opposition forces and pro-establishment groups,&#8221; Tam said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>○ While violence in Hong Kong was glorified and justified by many Westerners and Western media, foreigners living Hong Kong said they feel disgusted by the violence that targets people</em></p>
<p><em>○ Some foreigners said Western rhetorics only make things a lot worse because the rioters think they get support encouraging them to carry on with violence</em></p>

<p>In Western rhetoric, democracy and human rights matter above all. However, amid the six-month-long violent protests that have engulfed Hong Kong, many Westerners&#8217; view of the protests has changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong used to see an influx of expatriates from the US, Europe and Asian countries, making the city a diverse and tolerant society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for many foreigners living in Hong Kong who view this place as home, when their lives were disrupted by growing violence and they were assaulted for holding different opinions, the city gives them mixed feelings.</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-11-25/eec6f6d7-762c-4e52-9100-1716330f05ac.jpeg"><br />
</center></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Violence &#8216;disgusting&#8217;</span></strong></p>
<p>When Alun Wessler, a British teacher who has been living in Hong Kong for 15 years, was abused by a group of black-clad protesters outside an MTR station in early November simply because he told them he hated violence and he wanted to travel by MTR, he was disgusted and shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The abuse was just very un-Chinese and really impolite. I&#8217;m over 50 obviously and I think I deserve a little bit respect in Chinese culture and they got no civilization and no culture,&#8221; said Wessler.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wessler called the various acts of protesters &#8220;disgraceful&#8221; as TV footage and online video clips show protesters setting an elderly man on fire, a cleaner being hit by a brick during clashes who later died, and rioters violently bullying mainland people.</p>
<p>He admitted that the social environment is tense now as some people in his school support the protesters and everybody has to be careful. Different from people in the West who call the rioters &#8220;democracy campaigners&#8221; and &#8220;freedom fighters,&#8221; Wessler thinks they are &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such Western support will only make things a lot worse because the rioters think they get support that encourages them to carry on,&#8221; Wessler told the Global Times.</p>
<p>People like Wessler view violent protesters as &#8220;rioters,&#8221; and others see them as &#8220;terrorists,&#8221; such as Sky Darmos who saw one in September making a speech to teach his fellows how to use fire to attack the police.</p>
<p>However, this German researcher from the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong was fired right away because of his opinion though the university claimed that he was only an external collaborator for a project.</p>
<p>Darmos told the Global Times that he has left Hong Kong and has no plan to come back.</p>
<p>Arthur Bauer from the US has been living in Hong Kong for 20 years. He now works as a senior executive in a global IT company.</p>
<p>His emotion against the rioters and the violence inflicted by them is even stronger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could never have imagined I would be witness to such lawlessness, such brutality, and inhumanity being inflicted by one group of human beings on another. The violence has been nothing but cowardly &#8211; mobs of young kids fuelled by the anonymity of their masks bludgeoning innocent old men who are proud people of Hong Kong who did nothing more than exercising the most basic freedoms allowed in Hong Kong &#8211; the right to express their opinion and question why these protesters are destroying their city, carrying foreign flags, disrupting traffic and brutalizing innocent people and terrorizing our society,&#8221; lamented Bauer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ironically these rioters are seeking a platform for the very things they are taking away from others with pure and unrestricted violence &#8211; the right to free speech. I cannot excuse this behavior and do not believe it can be excused. The mob violence, the anarchy and the lawlessness, that they are inflicting on what was one of the most free and open cities in the world, cannot be justified,&#8221; Bauer added.</p>
<p>Bauer told the Global Times that most Westerners are turning a blind eye to the violence because it does not support the narrative they are trying to impose on the world. He said people he has met in his travels to North America are stunned by the mob violence on innocent people which they were previously ignorant of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those people actively support the violence because it causes the disruption they seek in the pursuit of their broader political agenda,&#8221; Bauer believed, adding that he once submitted to websites of US Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz and 60 Minutes, an American news magazine and television program broadcast on the CBS television network, but stopped listening because of their biased pieces on the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//content/968898.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hong Kong riot</a>s.</p>
<p>During a brief trip to Hong Kong, Cruz claimed that he did not see any violence from anti-government demonstrations.</p>
<p>Not only are the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; Westerners embattled by the current situation in Hong Kong, ethnic communities also walk on a tight rope.</p>
<p>Qurrat-ul-ain, a Pakistani part-time assistant at a district council office in Hong Kong, told the Global Times that she supports peaceful protests, but when the protests have become violent and her South Asian community was affected, she felt scared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October, South Asians were alleged to be behind a bloody assault on a high-profile pan-democratic figure, dragging this community into the months-long chaos. Protesters on social media platforms also called for attacking South Asians and even attacking the mosques.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has a long-established South Asian population, accounting for 4 percent of the whole population in the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qurrat told the Global Times that there were several occasions when protesters caused traffic disruption and messes nearby her house, which made it hard for her to find a way out. She said she saw protesters breaking the traffic lights with hammers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sometimes the violence gets too much because it causes problems for everybody so it has to be limited and controlled,&#8221; said Qurrat. &#8220;When we go out, we have to be really careful because right now there are even gangsters on the road and you don&#8217;t know whom they want to attack.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Stepping away</span></strong></p>
<p>Not only have foreigners been affected by the prolonged protests, but foreign investments are also stepping away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to official statistics released on November 1, the retail sector suffered a loss of 18.3 percent in September, an eighth consecutive month&#8217;s decline. Luciano Santel, chief corporate and supply officer of Moncler SpA, an Italian apparel and lifestyle company, reportedly said in an analysts&#8217; phone meeting that the sales plummeted 40 percent in the third quarter and there was no sign for any turnaround. He also said the company has suspended investment in public relations in Hong Kong to protect its employees and cut expenditure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kering SA, a French international luxury group, also reported a loss of 35 percent in the third quarter and sees a pessimistic prospect in the short term. The company has shifted some of its business in Hong Kong to other Asian markets including the Chinese mainland, South Korea and Singapore and the stocks originally designated to Hong Kong have been distributed to other areas.</p>
<p>The effect has also spanned to other sectors. Australia&#8217;s Qantas airline has already cut its passenger capacity for Hong Kong by 7 percent and started using smaller planes.</p>
<p>Bauer&#8217;s company is also among those having been affected in many ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our internal conferences scheduled to be in Hong Kong have moved to other cities like Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Seoul and Shanghai.&nbsp; All business travellers to Hong Kong now need special approval because Hong Kong is now on a restricted travel list. Many key resources and expertise cancel trips out of fear so we are unable to get the resources needed to effectively conduct business. All our Hong Kong customers business was severely impacted with substantially scaled back investments,&#8221; said Bauer.</p>
<p>But still, Bauer is hopeful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong will recover. Unfortunate but temporary phase,&#8221; he said. </p>

<p>No stocks tumbling. No capital flight. Hong Kong&#8217;s capital markets have been as solid as a rock despite external interference, especially the passage of a bill by the US Congress that supports<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//content/968898.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hong Kong riot</a>ers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such calm underlines Hong Kong stock market&#8217;s solid foundation, given its high market-oriented level and backbone from the economy in the Chinese mainland, experts commented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s financial markets have &#8220;responded calmly&#8221; and &#8220;operated as usual,&#8221; with a stable currency exchange rate and no signs of strong capital outflows, after the US Congress approved the so-called &#8220;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act&#8221; last week, wrote Paul Chan Mo-po, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in a blog on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong official went on to criticize the US&#8217; passing of the bill as &#8220;ungrounded,&#8221; saying that the US government should not poke its nose into Hong Kong affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The US has huge economic and other benefits in Hong Kong and has always benefited from the sizable trade surplus it has with Hong Kong. Besides, there are more than 1,300 US corporate branches in Hong Kong,&#8221; he said, adding that the US government should act cautiously to avoid losses by both sides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong rioter-supportive bill was passed by both houses of the US Congress last week and is on the way to the signature of US President Donald Trump, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>It added that the bill requires regular reviews of the city&#8217;s special financial status.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong stock market felt only a ripple from the news despite the sensation it caused in overseas media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s benchmark Hang Seng Index edged down 0.75 percent and 1.57 percent on Wednesday and Thursday, and corrected by 0.48 percent to 26,595.1 points on Friday.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong dollar edged up by 0.02 percent and 0.05 percent against the greenback on Wednesday and Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bill shows the intention of the US to obstruct China&#8217;s development via Hong Kong-related issues. But it is meaningless as the US can&#8217;t change the world&#8217;s optimistic outlook on the prospects of Hong Kong or the mainland,&#8221; Zhang Yi, CEO of Shenzhen-based iiMedia Research, said on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shorting selling meaningless</strong></p>
<p>Experts have condemned any external efforts to crack down on Hong Kong&#8217;s capital markets as being meaningless, stressing that the bourse offers a solid valuation for its listed shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong stock market &#8220;can well represent the shares&#8217; fundamental values, thanks to the high level of marketization and internationalization of the market,&#8221; Li Daxiao, chief economist at Shenzhen-based Yingda Securities, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sunday marks the 50th anniversary of the benchmark Hang Seng Index.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s benchmark stock gauge Hang Seng Index has soared by about 16,700 percent from its debut 50 years ago, according to a Bloomberg report on Saturday.</p>
<p>Li particularly mocked the possibility of damaging the Hong Kong economy via short selling on the share market, saying that such hopes are in vain and the fundamental conditions for such a move are missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hong Kong stock market has been seeing increasing liquidity and companies seeking listings from the Chinese mainland. This, plus the Hong Kong stock market&#8217;s strong valuation base, makes the so-called shorting activities very difficult,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been overseas reports about short sellers looking at the Hong Kong stock market to take advantage of the current instable social situation, with the city mired in violence for around half a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a securities analyst surnamed Liang, who is also a Hong Kong stock observer, told the Global Times on condition of anonymity that the number of short deals has decreased on the Hong Kong stock market recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong&#8217;s financial sector has achieved a relatively high margin of safety. The most volatile phase has already passed,&#8221; Liang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts also noted that the Hong Kong capital market will stand up to external obstruction, given the support it receives from the flourishing mainland economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They made the comments about two days ahead of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba&#8217;s mammoth secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock market, injecting what is deemed as a much-needed vote of confidence into the riot-hit city and its financial sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;Alibaba&#8217;s Hong Kong listing shows the confidence of not only Alibaba, but global capital, in the city. Otherwise the international shareholders of Alibaba, including those from the US and Japan, wouldn&#8217;t give a nod to the decision,&#8221; Zhang said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
</center>Heads of nine Hong Kong&nbsp; universities for the first time issued a joint statement on Friday accusing the government of not meeting protesting students&#8217; demands and not taking effective measures to stop violence on&nbsp; campuses in the past few days, which was criticized by experts and students from the mainland as a fence-sitting act by the university heads.</p>
<p>The joint statement shows that they, as heads of top educational institutes expected to cultivate talent for Hong Kong have forgotten their duty and conscience, experts say, which is appalling and shameful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This week, rioters besieged several universities, including the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), the Polytechnic University, and Hong Kong University, forcing staff members and students to evacuate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While masked radicals took control of these universities, they set up their own &#8220;kingdoms,&#8221; damaging properties, blocking the highway that leads to the universities and setting fire to vehicles, turning campuses into a warzone and bases for training terrorists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, rioters occupying the CUHK left the campus, leaving garbage behind and setting fire to a light rail.</p>
<p>The joint statement by university chiefs claimed that it is not realistic to count on universities to resolve the current political crisis as it is neither sparked by universities nor could it be resolved by universities&#8217; disciplinary processes.</p>
<p>Thus, they called on the government to take the lead with swift and concrete actions.</p>
<p>Observers pointed out that in the joint statement, the university chiefs still did not explicitly condemn the rioting and even avoided using the term &#8220;rioters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the joint statement on Friday, Tuan released an open letter, asking people from outside of the university to leave. Experts say this shows that Tuan has realized the damage the rioting could do to the campus, but he still failed to make a clear break from the rioters in an open manner.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s educators and university students say the statement lacks sincerity and universities should have taken disciplinary actions in face of campus violence even before the situation went out of control.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the students participated in illegal assemblies or riots, or were involved with absenteeism and abused or bullied other students and teachers, they have already broken the school regulations,&#8221; a Hong Kong-based teacher of an international school surnamed Mu told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, school managers didn&#8217;t or dare not to do something to stop them, so this made the situation worse,&#8221; Mu said, adding that not only the university students but teenagers in high schools and middle schools are also affected by radical ideology and extreme emotions.</p>
<p>A CUHK student from the mainland said he expected his university chief not to be bound by interests but to serve the students hailing all places. He also believes that the chief should not bow to the violence.</p>
<p>During a dialogue session between the university&#8217;s president Rocky S Tuan and students in October, Tuan was constantly interrupted by local students. While the students besieged Tuan and urged him to condemn &#8220;police brutality&#8221; after the dialogue, Tuan apparently compromised as protesters applauded, which is &#8220;disappointing,&#8221; according to the mainland student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CUHK has been labeled as the &#8220;University of Violence&#8221; by mainland students, as black-clad student protesters were seen wearing masks and practicing forces on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, at that time, the president never opposed clearly such violent activities,&#8221; said the mainland student who is currently in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>In an open letter to Tuan signed by a group of patriotic mainland students on Friday, the students blamed the CUHK president for sacrificing the interests of those who want to concentrate on study and harboring the so-called &#8220;freedom and democracy&#8221; demanded by violent protesters.</p>
<p>Mainland students from the University of Science and Technology also slammed the inaction of university authorities when one of their peers was assaulted by local students earlier this month.</p>
<p>In all of these circumstances, universities refused to call the police for fear of enraging local students.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong local alumnus of the CUHK surnamed Hung told the Global Times that the police have already told the public that the majority of the arrested suspects who participated in riots were university students, but the chiefs of those major universities in Hong Kong did not use their authority to stop their students from joining violent activities, such as expelling them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;So how could they say&nbsp; the current situation can&#8217;t be resolved through university disciplinary processes?&#8221; Hung questioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No university in this world will protect rioters and suspects involved in terrible violent activities, and expelling them from their studentship should be an imminent action that the universities need to stick to, Hung noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;These universities even stopped the police from arresting violent suspects from their campuses, and this is protecting rioters from the lawful punishment, so I hope these chiefs&nbsp; would stop shielding rioters, otherwise they should resign. If the situation gets worse, they might get lawsuit as well since they are shielding criminals,&#8221; Hung said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he also understands that senior managers of the universities have very limited power and their safety would be jeopardized if they act tough with the radical protesters.</p>
<p>The recent chaos has triggered many mainland students&#8217; return to the mainland for safety. This has had a spill-over effect as overseas universities are calling back exchange students in Hong Kong, such as the UK&#8217;s Warwick University and Edinburgh University.</p>

<p>Black-clad rioters in Hong Kong set a resident on fire in Ma On Shan on Monday, Hong Kong police confirmed with the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident reportedly took place at 12:52 pm Monday. Online video shows the man was arguing with the protesters and chanted &#8220;we are all Chinese.&#8221; A black-clad rioter poured an inflammable substance on the victim and lit him as he expressed different views.</p>
<p>The injured man was sent to a local hospital for treatment, according to Hong Kong media.</p>
<p>Blocking roads, throwing Molotov cocktails and setting fire to roads and subway carriages as well as common residents, black-clad rioters went on yet another rampage destroying the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disregarding the safety of others, rioters threw debris from a footbridge at a transport junction on Monday morning, seriously hindering traffic during morning rush hour. They have launched a general strike across the city and had planned to start disrupting public transport from 7 am, according to social networks like Telegram and LIHKG, which rioters use to organize rallies.</p>
<p>According to Hong Kong media, 22 stations on eight MRT lines suspended services on Monday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several universities including the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Shue Yan University announced the cancellation of all classes on Monday as public transport services were seriously affected, according to school announcements.</p>
<p>A local resident affected by traffic disruptions told the Global Times that rioters acted in a lawless and insane way. &#8220;They set fires in subway cars, throw Molotov cocktails at a school bus, and attacked ordinary people. We support the police to strictly enforce the law,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Police entered the campus of Polytechnic University to round up violent protesters rioters and allegedly fired tear gas, while a group of rioters vandalized university property.</p>
<p>Some rioters even set fires at Tate&#8217;s Cairn Tunnel at Shatin and inside MRT stations. Rioters set fires at Kwai Fung station this morning, seriously jeopardizing the safety of passengers and causing the suspension of services on the Tseun Wan line.</p>
<p>At around 7:30 am, a group of rioters set up barricades at a traffic junction in San Wan Ho and black-clad rioters attacked a police officer who came to carry out dispersal work. The police officer fired a live round at one rioter in self defense, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>During police operations, one police officer has discharged his service revolver, and one male was shot, Hong Kong police said in an announcement. In the Shatin and Tung Chung operations, police officers have drawn their service arms from their holsters.</p>
<p>Police dismissed online rumors that police management had ordered frontline officers to recklessly use their firearms in today&#8217;s operations. Police clarifies that this allegation is totally false and malicious. Police has strict guidelines and orders regarding the use of firearms. All Police officers are required to justify their enforcement actions, according to the police announcement.</p>
<p>The involved rioter who injured his left kidney and liver is reportedly undergoing surgery in hospital, according to Hong Kong media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong police officer Lau Chak-kei who once was forced to point a shotgun at rioters in self-defense in previous operations commented on Weibo on Monday, &#8220;There will be consequences for vandalism and blocking roads. Don&#8217;t assume that police would never open fire. This is international standard!&#8221;</p>
<p>Police urged the protesters to stop their illegal acts immediately. Police said in the morning that they were clearing barricades that had caused serious obstruction to traffic and were conducting dispersal operations. Police appealed to commuters to plan for longer journeys, and stay tuned to the latest traffic announcements.</p>

<p></center>With pro-establishment candidates standing at the forefront of possible targeted attacks as district elections are lurking around the corner, Junius Kwan-yiu Ho, an outspoken Hong Kong legislator who was a victim of knife attack earlier this week, urged the public to stand united against &#8220;black terror&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ho was attacked during an election campaign Wednesday morning in Tuen Mun by a man who approached him with a floral bouquet and a hidden sharp knife, and stabbed Ho on the chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attack left Ho with an about 1.5 centimeters long and 2.5 centimeters deep wound in his chest. Ho was lucky and survived as the edge of the intruding knife just missed his heart, he told the Global Times on Saturday in an exclusive interview. Following two days of treatment, he was discharged from the hospital on Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong opposition groups called the entire incident a choreographed one, in order to garner sympathy for pro-establishment candidates, who have become eyesores of the anti-government protesters over the past few months. They even raised questions like &#8220;why Ho&#8217;s assistant was able to shoot the footage of the attack?&#8221;</p>
<p>Since mid-July, Ho has emerged as a prime target in the eyes of the increasingly violent protesters, for his obvious and persistent support for Hong Kong Police Force and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government. He also provided evidence that revealed the months of protests are plotted by anti-government and some external anti-China forces.</p>
<p>Ho and his family have been subjected to constant harassment. In July, some black-clad protesters went too far and vandalized and desecrated the tombstones of his parental graves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve prepared for accidents by hiring two bodyguards, one usually protects my wife, another one follows me,&#8221; Ho told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the time of the attack, Ho&#8217;s two bodyguards were with him who quickly came to his defense, and subdued the knife stabber. &#8220;Luckily, they reacted quickly. If the man stabbed me one more time, I would have been dead now,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Ho said he trained his assistants to take photos and shoot videos at a variety of activities, as a precautionary measure in case of any untoward situation. &#8220;An assistant did capture the footage on Wednesday,&#8221; he said, referring to the video clip that became an important piece of evidence of the knife attack.</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-11-09/82ea1800-2ff5-4d0b-a4e1-80a224fa4f5b.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo:web</p>
<p>The knife attack, equivalent to a terror attack, was not caused by personal animosity or debt issue, the legislator noted. &#8220;During this political campaign, someone tried to silence me by unleashing such terror, as I&#8217;ve been too outspoken,&#8221; Ho said.</p>
<p>He is not the only pro-establishment legislator targeted by anti-government protesters. Over 60 offices of the pro-establishment Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong have been vandalized on more than 80 rages, and those cases are yet to be dealt with.</p>
<p>In line with the provisions of the Security and Guarding Services Ordinance, personal security measures could be further strengthened, Ho suggested. Security staff could be trained from taking preventive measures when responding to mob attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The black terror continued spreading across the city, as brutal attacks on ordinary people have become a common sight. A man was assaulted in Tseung Kwan O Saturday morning after he called the police complaining about the noise created by rioters. Rioters also attacked people who disagree with them, and they smashed equipment and attacked a cameraman of TVB Friday night due to their alleged unfavorable media coverage of the anti-government protesters and for exposing their violent acts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opposition groups have come up with different slogans but they only have one objective, which is to take over the control of the HKSAR government. Anti-government forces are increasingly resorting to violence to unleash fear among Hong Kong residents, dampening their enthusiasm to come out and vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;District elections on November 24 will be a battle for conscience,&#8221; Ho said, urging the public to bravely say &#8220;no&#8221; to violence and black terror which have seriously battered Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
