<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Police cordon off the road near a school where two fully functional home-made bombs are found in Hong Kong, China, Dec. 9, 2019. (Xinhua)</p>
<p>The Hong Kong police said on Monday night that they have successfully defused two home-made remote-controlled bombs inside a school which were fully functional and may cause multiple casualties.</p>
<p>The police received tip-off at around 5:30 p.m. on Monday local time that two suspected bombs were found inside the campus of Wah Yan College, a secondary school in Wan Chai, Senior Superintendent Li Kwai-wah of Organized Crime and Triad Bureau, said at a media briefing.</p>
<p>Bomb disposal officers of the police Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau were then deployed to the scene, and found two suspicious objects attached with wires and mobile phones.</p>
<p>After examination, the officers confirmed the two radio-controlled improvised explosive devices were &#8220;fully functional and ready to be used,&#8221; said Senior Bomb Disposal Officer Alick McWhirter.</p>
<p>According to McWhirter, the two devices contained approximately a total of 10 kg of high explosives. The explosives consisted of two different types, a primary high explosive designed to act as the detonator and booster and a secondary high explosive based around ammonium nitrate.</p>
<p>In addition to the large quantities of explosives, shrapnel in the form of nails had also been added to both of the devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of these devices have only one function, to kill and to maim people, given the quantities of the explosive and fragmentation,&#8221; McWhirter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had these devices functioned, they would have killed and injured large number of people. These were exceptionally dangerous and credible devices,&#8221; he said, adding that the bombs&#8217; killing range could reach 50 to 100 meters.</p>
<p>Li said the police will investigate who placed the bombs inside the school, the perpetrator&#8217;s motive and target, as well as the incident&#8217;s connection with recent violent activities.</p>
<p>He said making or possession of explosives is a serious crime liable to imprisonment for 14 years, and using any explosive substance to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property is liable to life imprisonment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government expressed on Friday deep regret over the spreading of untrue claims overseas in recent days by some Hong Kong political figures who urged foreign governments or legislatures to interfere with the affairs of the HKSAR. </p>
<p>&#8220;Some politicians in Hong Kong openly supported the United States&#8217; &#8216;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act&#8217;, and suggested similar legislation in other countries or regions with the intent to demand foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs. This only conveys the wrong message to violent protesters and misleads them into thinking they have gained the support from other countries or regions. These politicians must bear the responsibility for society descending into chaos,&#8221; the HKSAR government said in a statement released on Friday night. </p>
<p>From June this year until now, there have been over 900 demonstrations, processions and public meetings held in Hong Kong. &#8220;Some political figures freely took part in these assemblies and processions and conducted media interviews without any restrictions. Ironically, they are also the ones who incessantly criticize the HKSAR government for suppressing freedom,&#8221; said the statement. </p>
<p>&#8220;We urge these Hong Kong politicians, who wantonly smear our city&#8217;s reputation, to treasure Hong Kong&#8217;s freedom. The entire society should say no to violence and persuade protesters to express their views in a peaceful manner, to prevent peaceful protests from mutating to violent confrontations, and to stop depriving people with different opinions the freedom to live a normal life, to voice their discontent against violence and to take photos of rioters&#8217; destructive acts,&#8221; it said. </p>
<p>&#8220;These irresponsible politicians, who make prejudicial and false statements about the conditions of human rights and freedom in Hong Kong, mislead people into thinking human rights and freedoms are being suppressed in the city. If such comments tarnish the international reputation of Hong Kong, they would also take a toll on investor confidence, exert more pressure on Hong Kong&#8217;s economy, and ultimately make society and the general public suffer,&#8221; it added. </p>
<p>Stressing that &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; is the best arrangement to maintain Hong Kong&#8217;s long-term prosperity and stability and to make Hong Kong a favorable place in which to live and work, the HKSAR government said it will resolutely continue to implement the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle, and urged the relevant political figures to &#8220;stop all acts showing contempt towards &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; which disregard the interests of the country and Hong Kong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hong Kong should restore order and peace as soon as possible to retain talent, a senior official of China&#8217;s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said here Sunday.</p>
<p>Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung urged immediate efforts to bring back peace to Hong Kong in a bid to rebuild the confidence and trust of the international community, as well as the global image of Hong Kong, in his weekly online article.</p>
<p>It is unavoidable that some local and international talent consider building a career elsewhere for various reasons in the current situation, Cheung said.</p>
<p>However, Cheung stressed that there is no massive brain drain in Hong Kong, whose advantages and competitiveness are still recognized by international institutions.</p>
<p>The senior official said fostering and attracting top talent is crucial to the development of Hong Kong, which is facing the challenge of an aging population and a labor shortage.</p>
<p>He also said that the HKSAR government will continue working on a human resource plan to make Hong Kong more competitive and help the younger generation to grasp the opportunity of development.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: GT</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Reuters published a report that said a crisis command center for Hong Kong Special Administrative Region had been set up on the mainland, and the official liaison personnel to HKSAR were to be changed, citing as the source &#8220;people familiar with the matter&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;People familiar with the matter&#8221; has become probably the most common source of information about Hong Kong in Western media reports, which are characterized by hearsay and rumors. Their reports have no source, and no clue about what is really going on.</p>
<p>Such unverified reports are harmful to a media outlet&#8217;s credibility, and Reuters is not the only Western media outlet that has been guilty of the practice when reporting on Hong Kong. On Nov 22, in an interview, US-based Fox News said that there were &#8220;a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong&#8221; and the city &#8220;would have been obliterated in 14 minutes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Come on! Does Fox News know how much land it would take to station a million soldiers? Please check before broadcasting such a hyperbolic claim someone has made in an interview.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned are just two of the maybe thousands of absurd fake reports that Western media outlets have made about Hong Kong in the past five months.</p>
<p>On Nov 11, Associated Press reported that a Hong Kong police officer shot a rioter as breaking news. However, AP never mentioning the latter tried to grab the gun from the police officer. They have even edited on-site video clips to mislead viewers.</p>
<p>Worse, AP noticed &#8220;a patch of what looked like dried blood&#8221; in the video clip, without ever telling readers there was another police officer there beside the &#8220;dried blood&#8221;, trying to help the shot rioter.</p>
<p>The cause of the reports is obvious: Deeply rooted bias and prejudice against China. However, their fake news ruses will fail. We live in an age in which everybody has a microphone, and their rumors will not have legs.</p>
<p>Certain Western media outlets are rather adept at attracting eyeballs by hyping things up out of nothing. But doing so only draws attention to the lack of truth and neutrality in their reporting.</p>

<br />Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang on Monday summoned U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to lodge stern representations and strong protest against both the House of the Representatives and Senate passing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019.</p>
<p>China urges the United States to correct its mistake immediately, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China&#8217;s other internal affairs, Zheng said.</p>
<p>Reiterating that Hong Kong is part of China and Hong Kong affairs are purely China&#8217;s internal affairs, Zheng said the aforementioned act blatantly interferes in China&#8217;s internal affairs. He accused U.S. Congress of neglecting facts and truth, conniving at and supporting anti-China rabble rousers&#8217; violent crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in serious violation of international law and basic norms governing international relations. China strongly condemns and firmly opposes it,&#8221; said Zheng.</p>
<p>China has unswerving determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, to implement the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle and to oppose any external forces to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any attempts to put Hong Kong in chaos and destory Hong Kong&#8217;s stability and prosperity are doomed to fail, &#8221; said Zheng.</p>
<p>China strongly urges the United States to grasp the situation, immediately correct its mistake, prevent the act from becoming law and stop any words and deeds that interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China&#8217;s other internal affairs, the vice foreign minister said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise, the United States has to bear all the consequences that arise,&#8221; Zheng said.</p>
