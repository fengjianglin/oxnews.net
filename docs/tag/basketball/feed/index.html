<p>Luka Doncic finished just shy of a triple-double as the Dallas Mavericks gave the Los Angeles Lakers a reality check Sunday by snapping their 10-game win streak with a 114-100 win.</p>
<p>Doncic was just one rebound short of the triple double finishing with 27 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds, as the visiting Mavericks avenged a 119-110 overtime loss to Los Angeles one month ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great win that means a lot to us,&#8221; Doncic, 20, said. &#8220;It shows that we can play against big teams, too. We just need to keep it rolling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first-place Mavericks improved to 13-6 on the season and were too much to handle for the Lakers, whose win streak came against 10 teams, all with losing records.</p>
<p>The last time Los Angeles played a team with a better than .500 record, which was the ­Toronto Raptors on November 10, they lost 113-104.</p>
<p>Delon Wright came off the bench to tally 17 points and nine assists while Dwight Powell, Kristaps Porzingis and Justin Jackson contributed 15 points apiece in the win.</p>
<p>Anthony Davis had 27 points and 10 rebounds and LeBron James tallied 25 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for Los Angeles. James also had six of the Lakers 17 turnovers.</p>
<p>The Lakers&#8217; next two games are against Denver and Utah, who are one and two atop the Northwest Division standings.</p>
<p>Kyle Kuzma shot just one of 13 from the floor while Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo each scored just four points as the Mavericks&#8217; bench outscored the Lakers&#8217; reserve 43-29.</p>
<p>Dallas used a brilliant third quarter to seize command of the game.</p>
<p>Doncic, who was bloodied and muscled off the ball several times in the November loss to the Lakers, held his ground on Sunday, scoring 16 of his points in the third quarter.</p>
<p>In Toronto, Pascal Siakam scored 35 points and the Toronto Raptors turned a 40 point halftime lead into a 130-110 win over the Utah Jazz.</p>
<p>Fred VanVleet added 21 points and 11 assists for the Raptors, who are a club record 9-0 at home to open the season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also are on a season-best seven-game winning streak overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Conley had 20 points for the Jazz, who have lost three of their past four games on a five-game road trip.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Chris Paul scored seven of his 16 points late in the fourth quarter of the Oklahoma City Thunder&#8217;s 107-104 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans.</p>

<p>Los Angeles forward Anthony Davis shrugged off the boos that greeted his return to New Orleans on Wednesday, scoring 41 points to power the Lakers to a 114-110 NBA victory over the Pelicans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man it feels so good,&#8221; said Davis, who finished his night by grabbing an attempted inbounds pass from New Orleans&#8217; Jrue Holiday with 4.2 seconds left and then sinking two free throws to close out the come-from-behind win.</p>
<p>Los Angeles had trailed by as many as 16 early in the third quarter but opened the fourth on a 9-0 scoring run as they trimmed the deficit to one point.</p>
<p>Kyle Kuzma&#8217;s three-pointer knotted the score at 91-91, but the Pelicans pushed their lead back to four points before Davis returned from treatment on his right elbow and stuffed a dunk off a pass from LeBron James.</p>
<p>&#8220;They made shot after shot, big shots,&#8221; said Davis, who was booed by Pelicans fans in the opening introductions and every time he touched the ball thereafter. &#8220;We showed our resiliency tonight and we were able to get the win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis, who had been booed by Pels fans last year when he tried to engineer a trade from the club &#8211; a move that finally happened in the off-season, said he was prepared for the reaction. &#8220;I just tried to play through it and calm my nerves and play basketball,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Milwaukee&#8217;s Giannis Antetokounmpo and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James delivered exceptional scoring efforts as their conference-leading clubs stretched NBA win streaks to eight games on Monday.</p>
<p>Greek playmaker Antetokounmpo scored 50 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and ­added six assists to rally the Bucks over the visiting Utah Jazz 122-118.</p>
<p>The reigning NBA Most Valuable Player&#8217;s run of 17 double-­doubles to start a season is the NBA&#8217;s longest since 1976.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just trying to get better,&#8221; said Antetokounmpo. &#8220;Take it day by day, game by game and just get myself ready in games that matter the most.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be the last team playing at the end of the season.&#8221;</p>
<p>Four-time NBA MVP James scored 33 points and passed off 14 assists while Anthony Davis contributed 19 points and 12 rebounds to spark the NBA-­leading Lakers in a 114-104 victory at San Antonio.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was unbelievable,&#8221; Lakers coach Frank Vogel said of James. &#8220;He just dominated the action, made everything offensively.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lakers improved to an NBA-best 15-2 to pace the Western Conference with Milwaukee atop the Eastern Conference at 14-3, the league&#8217;s second-best record.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to be in the position we&#8217;re in,&#8221; James said.</p>
<p>James made 13 of 24 shots from the floor, including four of seven from the three-point range, and his 12 in the fourth quarter helped the Lakers improve to 7-1 on the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just want to be able to not have any weaknesses and allow a defense to dictate what I do,&#8221; James said. &#8220;Just trying to be the most complete basketball player I can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bucks are on their longest win streak since the 2001-02 season.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just playing together and having fun,&#8221; Antetokounmpo said. &#8220;Our defense has been really good lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antetokounmpo scored 32 points in the second half to spark a comeback for the Bucks and chants of &#8220;M-V-P&#8221; from Bucks fans.</p>
<p>Utah led 57-48 at halftime but surrendered 42 points to Milwaukee in the third quarter and made only 26.</p>
<p>Utah&#8217;s Donovan Mitchell was driving for a tying layup in the dying seconds but Brook Lopez blocked the shot to preserve Milwaukee&#8217;s victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a big-time block,&#8221; Antetokounmpo said.</p>

<p>Kawhi Leonard and Paul George combined for 42 points in their first game together as the Los Angeles Clippers pulled out a 107-104 overtime victory over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The game marked the first time George and Leonard played together since both joined the Clippers in the offseason.</p>
<p>Leonard, who scored 17 points on seven-of-20 shooting, was coming off a three game rest and George &#8211; who missed the start of the season with a shoulder injury &#8211; was playing in his fourth game.</p>
<p>Rivers said George, who finished with 25 points, is still trying to play himself into shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was more concerned minute wise with Paul than Kawhi,&#8221; Rivers said. &#8220;It is funny. He [George] told me in the first half, &#8216;I got to play more because I got to get in better shape. I am exhausted out here.&#8217; This game helped. He was pretty strong at the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lou Williams scored a team-high 27 points and Patrick Beverley grabbed a career-best 16 rebounds to go along with 14 points and seven assists. JaMychal Green also added 10 points as Los Angeles won its third straight game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with a season-high 30 points. Marcus Smart recorded 15 points and eight assists, Brad Wanamaker added 14 points, and Kemba Walker had 13 points and nine rebounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a high-level game,&#8221; said Celtics coach Brad Stevens. &#8220;Both teams competed, even when the shots weren&#8217;t going down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boston had their chances as Tatum missed a tying three-point attempt with two seconds left, and Leonard blocked Walker&#8217;s desperation three-point attempt just before the buzzer in overtime.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was an ugly win, but it was beautiful,&#8221; Rivers said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Luka Doncic posted his league-leading seventh triple-double of the season en route to a 35-point performance as the Dallas Mavericks trounced the Golden State Warriors 142-94.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Slovenian scored 35 points in just 26 minutes of playing time and he finished with 11 assists and 10 rebounds in front of a crowd of 19,500 at the American Airlines Center.</p>
<p>Doncic scored 33 of his points in the opening half en route to his second consecutive triple-double. He was coming off a career-best, 42-point performance in a triple double Monday against San Antonio.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six-time All-Star Pau Gasol has been waived by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 7-foot-1 power forward said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Signed in July as a free agent, Gasol, 39, did not play a game this season while trying to recover from surgery on his left foot. He will continue his rehabilitation in Portland while discussing a coaching job with the Blazers.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Gasol wrote, &#8220;As of today, I will no longer be a member of the @TrailBlazers player roster, so I can focus all my energy on my rehabilitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a video posted in the tweet, Gasol said he had hoped his surgery, performed last May, would expedite his recovery, but recent tests have shown he&#8217;ll be out longer than originally hoped for.</p>
<p>Last season was Gasol&#8217;s least productive in his 18-year NBA career. In failing to average double digits in scoring for the first time, he averaged 3.9 points and 4.6 rebounds per game in 30 contests (six starts) with the San Antonio Spurs and Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
<p>After being bought out by the Spurs on March 1, Gasol joined the East-leading Bucks two days later. But he appeared in only three games before a stress fracture in his left foot ended his season.</p>
<p>Gasol&#8217;s has career averages of 17.0 points, 9.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists with the Memphis Grizzlies, Los Angeles Lakers, Chicago Bulls, Spurs and Bucks.</p>
<p>He averaged 17.6 points and 8.9 rebounds per game for the Grizzlies in 2001-02, his rookie season. After being traded to the Lakers in February 2008, he was a member of a Kobe Bryant-led team that won two NBA championships.</p>
<p>Gasol played with the Lakers through the 2013-14 season before two All-Star seasons with the Bulls. The veteran signed with the Spurs before the 2016-17 season.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />LeBron James became the first player in NBA history to record a triple-­double against every team in the league on Tuesday as the Los Angeles Lakers powered to victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
<p>James finished with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a hardfought 112-107 win over the Thunder at the Staples Center.</p>
<p>Anthony Davis led the Lakers&#8217; scoring with 34 points, while adding seven rebounds and four assists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The win saw the Lakers improve to 12-2 to remain on top of the Western Conference.</p>
<p>But it was James&#8217; 86th career triple-double that grabbed the headlines, the Lakers star sealing the milestone with an assist to Davis with just over four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>James said the record would not have been possible without the support of coaches and teammates over the years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know what to think about it to be honest,&#8221; James told reporters when asked about the feat. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had some great teammates and great coaches who&#8217;ve put me in position to facilitate. My teammates have made shots for me throughout my career, coaches have put me in position to be successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully in all those triple-doubles I&#8217;ve got a winning record because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s most important. But it&#8217;s a pretty cool stat and I&#8217;m glad it happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>In New Orleans, Carmelo Anthony made an unsuccessful return to the NBA after more than a year out of the game as the Portland Trail Blazers slumped to a 115-104 loss to the Pelicans.</p>
<p>Anthony, whose move to Portland was confirmed by the team earlier Tuesday, finished with just 10 points after 23 minutes on court after shooting just 4-of-14 from the field.</p>
<p>It was a largely frustrating night for the 35-year-old 10-time All-Star, with Portland giving up 17 turnovers as the Pelicans dominated a shaky Blazers defense.</p>
<p>Anthony however was simply happy to have made his return to the league, just over a year after he was released from the Houston Rockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;My body felt good, better than what I expected,&#8221; Anthony said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just enjoyed being back out there, getting into the flow of things, the routines, putting the uniform on and getting up and down the court.&#8221;</p>

<p>The New Zealand Breakers basketball club defended their team culture Tuesday after a drunken disturbance on a plane added to a list of controversies.</p>
<p>Police quizzed forward Tom Vodanovich over the incident following this week&#8217;s loss to the Perth Wildcats for the Breakers, who are second-last in Australia&#8217;s National Basketball League (NBL) and seemingly in free-fall as disciplinary problems mount.</p>
<p>The club confirmed that New Zealand police at Auckland airport met Vodanovich on Monday after reports of a midair disturbance on the flight from Perth following the 88-77 loss.</p>
<p>No charges were laid but the Breakers said Vodanovich would be disciplined internally. The player apologized for his behavior, which reportedly occurred ­after he mixed alcohol and a sleeping pill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am mortified to have embarrassed the club and myself on the flight,&#8221; he said in a statement released by the club.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am particularly upset to have contributed to the perception there is a bad culture at the club, when it absolutely is not the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incident came after the NBL stepped in to prevent guard Glen Rice Jr from playing in Sunday&#8217;s Wildcats game because he had been arrested over an ­altercation in an Auckland bar a few days earlier.</p>
<p>Breakers officials have since slapped an indefinite suspension on Rice Jr, the son of three-time NBA All-Star Glen Rice, saying new information had come to light.</p>
<p>Rice Jr&#8217;s career has been littered with off-field problems and Breakers owner Matt Walsh conceded that hiring the 28-year-old this month as injury cover had not worked out.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no denying he has let down the club, our fans and the New Zealand public after we gave him this lifeline,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rice Jr is due to appear in court on Wednesday charged with assault.</p>
<p>Walsh himself was fined and handed a two-game suspension from attending Breakers games earlier this month after launching a courtside tirade at NBL Commissioner Jeremy Loeliger during a match in Melbourne.</p>
<p>He denied there was a culture problem at the club, which was once a powerhouse that claimed four titles but has struggled since a consortium led by Walsh took over last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m conscious of how it looks but I&#8217;m comfortable with what we&#8217;re doing internally and the decisions that we&#8217;re making,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Bahamian guard Buddy Hield scored a season-high 35 points and the Sacramento Kings snapped the Boston Celtics&#8217; 10-game NBA win streak with a 100-99 home triumph on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sacramento center Richaun Holmes sank two decisive free throws with 13 seconds remaining to give the Kings their fifth win in seven games after an 0-5 start.</p>
<p>Boston fell to 10-2, having not lost since their season opener three and a half weeks ago at Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The Celtics, led by Jaylen Brown&#8217;s 18 points, saw the end of their longest win streak since taking 16 in a row early in the 2017-18 campaign.</p>
<p>Hield&#8217;s three-pointer with 1:52 remaining gave the Kings a 96-95 lead.</p>
<p>Boston&#8217;s Jayson Tatum answered with a jumper but Hield, who went 14-of-24 from the floor, struck again with a fadeaway only for Boston to answer on a Daniel Theis dunk, giving the Celtics a 99-98 edge with 52 seconds remaining.</p>
<p>Holmes was fouled going for a rebound by Boston&#8217;s Marcus Smart and sank two free throws to put the Kings ahead by the final margin.</p>
<p>Smart missed a jumper for the win at the final buzzer and Sacramento had the victory.</p>
<p>Serbian swingman Bogdan Bogdanovic had 12 points and 10 assists for the Kings while Serbian forward Nemanja Bjelica added 12 points and 14 rebounds for Sacramento.</p>
<p>Boston guard Kemba Walker added 15 points and nine assists, Smart had nine assists, Brown grabbed eight rebounds, Tatum had 14 points and Theis contributed 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, LeBron James scored 33 points as the Los Angeles Lakers cruised to a 122-101 win over the struggling Atlanta Hawks.</p>
<p>The Lakers jumped out to a 25-point lead in the first quarter and never looked back. Rajon Rondo scored 15 points and Anthony Davis added 14 as the Lakers posted their 11th win in their last 12 games since a season-opening loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trae Young scored 31 points and Cam Reddish added 13 as the Hawks lost their third straight game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atlanta was blown out in Los Angeles for the second consecutive night after losing by 49 points to the Clippers.</p>
