<p>A hip-hop video talking about the violent situation in Hong Kong has gone viral on Chinese social media with many netizens saying that it shows young people&#8217;s reflections on the double standards used by Western media when reporting the riots in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tianfu Shibian, or CD REV as it calls itself in English, a hip-hop band from Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province, made the rap song, titled Hong Kong&#8217;s Fall, which went viral online and sparked discussions, especially when the official website and account of People&#8217;s Daily and the Communist Youth League reposted them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A webpage on Sina Weibo, China&#8217;s Twitter-like social media, with the hashtag &#8220;Hip-hop MV for Hong Kong&#8221; had been viewed more than 15.7 million times as of press time. Many netizens said the videos use rapping in English to satirize US politicians and media&#8217;s hypocrisy when talking about what is happening in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s Fall talks about rioters in Hong Kong using democracy as an excuse to hurt people who have different opinions. The video had been viewed more than 20 million times on Weibo as of press time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;m talking about the American hypocrisy. They know nothing about love, just wars and casualties,&#8221; read the lyrics.</p>
<p>The video intertwines footage of violent activities in Hong Kong, including rioters setting an elderly man on fire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang Zixin, leader of the band, told the Global Times that it took them only half a day to write the song.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read news about Hong Kong every day and feel furious about the violent activities of black-clad rioters… we want to use some sharp words to talk about American hypocrisy,&#8221; Wang said, noting that many netizens left messages on the band&#8217;s official Sina Weibo account and admired their efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video has also been posted in overseas social media and Wang said that overseas netizens showed support as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We sing in English about what many Chinese young people think about the current situation in Hong Kong. Criticizing the government has become a kind of political correctness in the US, which is not right to us. I think rappers can also use their songs to promote positive energy in society,&#8221; Wang said.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Hong Kong Photo:VCG</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Financial Secretary of China&#8217;s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government Paul Chan said Sunday that the financial markets remained normal after the passage of Hong Kong-related bills by the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Local financial markets reacted calmly and operated normally, Chan said in an online article, citing a firm Hong Kong dollar, stable interest rates, and no signs of massive capital flight.</p>
<p>Chan said the HKSAR government will closely monitor and assess the situation.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress passed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and another Hong Kong-related bill earlier this week.</p>
<p>Chan urged the United States to be cautious and avoid to harm the interests of both sides. &#8220;The bills are unwarranted and the United States should not interfere in the internal affairs of Hong Kong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The United States has enormous economic interests in Hong Kong as it has in the past 10 years earned the largest worldwide bilateral trade surplus in trade with Hong Kong and more than 1,300 U.S. firms operate here, Chan said.</p>
<p>However, Hong Kong has become less reliant on economic ties with the United States.</p>
<p>With the rapid development in Asia, the mainland has become Hong Kong&#8217;s largest trading partner, and the United States, in the fourth place, accounted for only 6.6 percent of Hong Kong&#8217;s foreign goods trade in 2018, Chan said.</p>
<p>Chan expects Hong Kong&#8217;s closer economic ties with the mainland to generate new opportunities.</p>
<p>The two sides signed on Thursday an agreement on the liberalization and facilitation of trade in services to lower the mainland market access thresholds for Hong Kong enterprises and professionals.</p>
<p>The agreement covers Hong Kong&#8217;s advantageous sectors including financial services, legal services, construction and related engineering services, testing and certification, television, motion pictures, and tourism services, Chan said.</p>
<p>Chan also noted that recent violent incidents posed a more serious threat to the local economy than external factors.</p>
<p>Major roads were repeatedly blocked, and shops were trashed. Residents were fatally attacked. A wide range of sectors including retail, catering, and tourism bore the major brunt.</p>
<p>Chan warned that Hong Kong&#8217;s core competitiveness will be harmed and global investors will lose confidence in Hong Kong if the unrest continues, calling on Hong Kong residents to jointly support stopping violence and protect the future of Hong Kong.</p>

<p> The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government needs to be more courageous in carrying out effective measures to end riots, said Hong Kong&#8217;s former security minister.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ask for Beijing&#8217;s help in dealing with the ongoing riots is one option for Chief Executive Carrie Lam&#8217;s office, and it always depends on the HKSAR government, said Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, also a member of the Hong Kong government&#8217;s Legislative Council.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She explained that the chief executive of the HKSAR government could consider enhancing the police force by appointing special constables and temporary police, or by hiring mercenaries and even mainland security forces, amid citywide riots paralyzing the city for consecutive weekdays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some foreigners who live here also expressed their hope for an end to the violence, and have asked me why Beijing wouldn&#8217;t step in and come to help us reach this goal,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the Basic Law&#8217;s Article 14, Lam could ask help from the People&#8217;s Liberation Army, and Article 18 gives power to the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress to declare a state of emergency and send in the army. &#8220;But I think it&#8217;s not the option of our nation,&#8221; Ip said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the HKSAR government does not have many options by enacting its own laws, and seeking the help of the central government has always been an option, but it depends on how the HKSAR government acts to strengthen the police force, she said. &#8220;We need at least 5,000 police officers,&#8221; Ip said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city has been engulfed in anti-government protests for about five months while escalated violence has been shifting from streets to universities. Rioters block roads and paralyze traffic, forcing schools to suspend classes. Mobs also attacked people who disagree with them, threw Molotov cocktails at train stations, banks and other public places. A man in his 70s was hit with a hard object at a recent mob clash and died on Thursday, becoming the first innocent civilian killed amid riots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Hong Kong society has been urged to take &#8220;ending riots&#8221; a top priority, the former secretary for security expects Lam&#8217;s office to carry out more effective and decisive measures to end the riots.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-11-15/f34302a1-cc43-407e-b9a2-75bd470a5724.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee Photo: Zhao Yu/GT</p>
<p>Based on what she knows, Ip said some financial conglomerates have raised more and more complaints, as their target markets are mainly in the mainland and Greater Bay Area. &#8220;They could get through it, but small and medium-sized enterprises have been experiencing more difficulties,&#8221; Ip said, noting that as a result, the HKSAR government is expected to become more active.</p>
<p>When the HKSAR government announced the Anti-mask Law, it did not cite a state of emergency, as some officials have concerns that declaring it would affect the city&#8217;s linked exchange rate system, which would trigger a financial crisis, the lawmaker said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve actually entered a state of emergency. If not, why would mainland students have to escape from our own land? I feel ashamed that we could not even protect our own compatriots, which is absurd,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Citywide protests have also been spreading to financial districts at daytime. Some banks urged staff to be cautious and canceled meetings amid protests, media reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as I know, there has been a growing fear among the mainland partners of some lawyers, consultants and accountants in Central Hong Kong. Some have left, and the status of the city as international business and financial center has already been jeopardized,&#8221; Ip said, noting that the HKSAR government should act in a more decisive way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without stability and security, the financial hub does not exist,&#8221; she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Radical protesters are now turning universities into their new battleground and training camps to hone their combat skills against police, and many said the city is on the brink of a breakdown, as major universities have suspended classes, while foreign and mainland students leave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ip also believes that some rioters have been paid to damage public property. &#8220;It has nothing to do with political requests. It&#8217;s either a paid job or just a video game for them, as they&#8217;ve been brainwashed,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As district elections loom, if the situation goes out of control, Ip said it would be difficult to hold smooth elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Friday Photo: Jia Lin</p>
<p>As rioters&#8217; days-long occupation of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has turned the campus into a &#8220;terrorist base,&#8221; the university president issued an open letter on Friday demanding that all outsiders leave the campus immediately as the university is not a &#8220;battlefield&#8221; to make and use weapons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our university has been occupied by masked men, including those from outside the university, and the situation has been completely out of control and is unacceptable,&#8221; CUHK President Rocky S. Tuan said in the letter published on the university&#8217;s website on Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tuan appealed to CUHK students who still stay on campus to leave as soon as possible,&nbsp;saying that the university will help them leave. The CUHK announced an early end to the fall term this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the operations of the university have been seriously affected, Tuan asked all outsiders to leave the university immediately. The university&nbsp;should&nbsp;not be a place for resolving political disputes or a battlefield for making and using weapons, Tuan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past few days, more than 1,000 masked men came to CUHK, most of whom Tuan believes were not CUHK students. They set fire, smashed buildings, dormitories and cafeterias, dug out bricks and used school buses without permission. Tuan said that repairing the damage would take months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the masked men even brought materials into the university to make Molotov cocktails, and some dangerous chemicals in university laboratories were stolen to make explosives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Wednesday, major entrances to the university were occupied by masked men who prevented vehicles from entering, including fire trucks and ambulances. All people who enter or leave the university had to show their ID and their belongings were searched by masked men. All of these actions have seriously affected students&#8217; freedom to enter and leave the university and created panic, Tuan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A total of 162 CUHK professors and faculty members also issued a joint open letter on Friday, calling on CUHK to issue an official statement criticizing protesters for damaging the campus, creating panic and disturbing peace of the campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those violent incidents have sparked fear and anxiety among students, faculty members, parents, and especially among parents of non-local students, but CUHK has failed to take immediate and enough measures to protect non-local students and has not criticized the mobs&#8217; violent behavior, the letter said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to photos the Global Times obtained on Friday, trash, empty bottles, umbrellas, bricks, wooden and iron bars and bottles with inflammable materials were all over the CUHK campus and along the roads leading to the campus. The exits of the MRT university station have been blocked with handrails, tables and other objects, according to the photos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>School facilities, including school buses, were smashed and sprayed with black paint to smear the Hong Kong government and police. Rioters even raised US flags, calling for US involvement, photos showed.</p>
<p>Since Thursday, black-clad protesters also used bricks and rocks to build fortresses to fight police, and occupied the campus cafeteria to cook their food, according to photos circulated online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong police called the CUHK an &#8220;arsenal&#8221; at Friday&#8217;s media briefing, saying more Molotov cocktails were hoarded in the campus and road blocks and barricades were built to block the entrance of the campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong media reported that some black-clad rioters packed up their materials and left the CUHK campus on Friday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from CUHK, Hong Kong media reported on Thursday that black-clad mobs who occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University have turned the campus into a &#8220;terror training camp,&#8221; as they tested their newly made catapults to fire stones, set barricades with stones and bricks at major gates, and practiced how to shoot arrows and use Molotov cocktails at a swimming pool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Xi Jinping&#8217;s latest remarks on the Hong Kong situation are the strongest voice from the central government on the work of ending violence and chaos in Hong Kong, a spokesperson said Friday. </p>
<p>Xi&#8217;s remarks on Thursday in Brazil have pointed the way to stabilizing the situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said Yang Guang, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council. </p>
<p>The president&#8217;s words came as the disturbances in Hong Kong have lasted more than five months and radical violent crimes have been escalating recently, the spokesperson said. </p>
<p>His remarks are a strong support to the Hong Kong SAR government led by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, a great inspiration to Hong Kong residents, and a stern warning to the rioters and their backroom supporting forces, Yang said. </p>
<p>The office will work with resolve to implement the president&#8217;s requirements to firmly support the chief executive in leading the SAR government to govern in accordance with the law, firmly support the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law, and firmly support the Hong Kong judicial bodies in severely punishing the violent criminals in accordance with the law, Yang said. </p>
<p>The spokesperson pledged various means of supporting and encouraging the Hong Kong people from all walks of life to build up &#8220;overwhelming positive energy&#8221; in countering violence and safeguarding rule of law, for the end of chaos and the restoration of social stability in Hong Kong as soon as possible. </p>
<p>&#8220;The central government and 1.4 billion people of China will always be the strongest backing for Hong Kong to overcome any challenges and risks,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>In response to a report issued by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the government of China&#8217;s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) reiterated late on Thursday that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR. </p>
<p>Since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has been exercising &#8220;Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong&#8221; and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the HKSAR Basic Law, said a spokesman of the HKSAR government. &#8220;The &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; principle has been fully and successfully implemented. The HKSAR government will continue to implement the &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; principle resolutely in accordance with the Basic Law.&#8221; </p>
<p>On human rights and freedoms, the spokesman stressed that safeguarding human rights and freedoms is a constitutional duty of the HKSAR government, as Article 4 of the Basic Law stipulates that the HKSAR shall safeguard the rights and freedoms of the residents of the HKSAR and of other persons in the region in accordance with law. </p>
<p>&#8220;Human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation, in addition to the Basic Law. The HKSAR government attaches great importance to human rights and freedoms and is determined to safeguard them,&#8221; the spokesman said. </p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, the HKSAR government has a duty to implement and uphold the Basic Law and to ensure that all elections will be conducted in accordance with the Basic Law and relevant electoral laws. There is no political screening,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Referring to the Basic Law which clearly stipulates that the HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC), the spokesman pointed out that any suggestion for &#8220;Hong Kong&#8217;s independence&#8221; is a blatant violation of the Basic Law and a direct affront to the national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the PRC. </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hong Kong&#8217;s independence&#8217; runs counter to the successful implementation of &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; and undermines the HKSAR&#8217;s constitutional and legal foundations as enshrined in the Basic Law. Relevant international human rights convention and court cases have clearly pointed out that freedom of speech is not absolute,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>On the rule of law in Hong Kong, the spokesman said the HKSAR government is committed to safeguarding the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong, and there is no question of &#8220;political prosecutions&#8221; as alleged by the US report. </p>
<p>&#8220;Article 63 of the Basic Law entrenches the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. The conduct of all criminal prosecutions of the Department of Justice (DoJ) is free from any interference. Decisions to prosecute or not, as the case may be, must be based on an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and the law, and be in accordance with the published Prosecution Code. No political consideration is being taken into account at all,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>In respect of the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 (the Bill), the spokesman said HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced on June 15 that the Bill was suspended and later made it clear that all the legislative work had come to a complete halt. The chief executive further announced on Sept. 4 that the HKSAR government would formally withdraw the Bill and the secretary for security withdrew the Bill at the Legislative Council meeting on Oct. 23. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the past few months, there were a series of protests and public order events in Hong Kong. Some of them eventually became violent and illegal incidents, causing damage to district and community facilities as well as injury to members of the public. In response, the police have been exercising restraint and have been carrying out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law,&#8221; he said, stressing that the purpose of police&#8217;s enforcement actions is to protect the life and property of the general public, bring offenders to justice and restore public order as soon as possible. </p>
<p>The Independent Police Complaints Council is conducting a fact-finding study on the handling of large-scale public order events since June, including corresponding actions by the police, to ascertain the facts and will prepare a report. The content of the report will be made public. </p>
<p>The HKSAR government has also launched a diversified dialogue platform and will invite community leaders, experts and academics to conduct an in-depth and independent examination of the social conflicts in Hong Kong and the deep-seated problems that must be addressed. </p>
<p>Concerning constitutional development, the spokesman said to achieve the ultimate aim of universal suffrage enshrined in the Basic Law, the community needs to engage in dialogues, premised on the legal basis and under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust, with a view to narrowing differences and attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides. </p>
<p>&#8220;The HKSAR government will assess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant Interpretation and Decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress.&#8221; </p>
<p>Regarding strategic trade control, the spokesman said that Hong Kong, as a separate customs territory under the Basic Law, has been implementing comprehensive control on import, export and re-export of strategic commodities in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and international control lists, carrying out rigorous enforcement, and maintaining close cooperation with the United States and other trading partners. </p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years, we have been closely collaborating with the US administration and achieved satisfactory results in preventing illegal diversion of strategic commodities. Our efforts in this regard are recognized by the relevant authorities. We regret deeply that despite our repeated explanation, the report has still erroneously cited a totally irrelevant case to cast doubt on Hong Kong&#8217;s strategic trade control system,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The Hong Kong police said on Friday noon that they are investigating a murder case in which a senior off-duty sanitation worker died in hospital late Thursday after being hit in his head by a brick hurled by a rioter. </p>
<p>Senior Superintendent Chan Tin-chu of the New Territories North Regional Crime Headquarters said that police have primarily confirmed what happened according to descriptions of witnesses and video footage. </p>
<p>A group of black-clad rioters set up roadblocks near North District Town Hall in Sheung Shui on Wednesday. They clashed with residents who tried to clear the road, throwing iron rods, bricks and other hard objects at the latter. </p>
<p>The victim, 70, was hit in the head by a brick when filming what was happening with his phone. He was knocked down to the ground and fell unconscious. The death was announced late Thursday at hospital. </p>
<p>The man, an outsourced worker of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, was walking past the clash spot alone on his lunch break. </p>
<p>This is the first death of an innocent civilian since the now-withdrawn ordinance amendments concerning fugitives&#8217; transfers sparked unrest in Hong Kong that escalated into severe violence. </p>
<p>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government expressed outrage over the malicious acts of the rioters, saying the police will follow up the case thoroughly to bring offenders to justice. </p>
<p>Rioters more frequently and brutally assaulted residents in recent days as police have reported three serious assaults on innocent people.</p>

<p>A principal official with the Liaison Office of the Central People&#8217;s Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Friday conveyed deep condolences to an innocent civilian who died of critical injury after being hit by rioters and expressed severe condemnation against extreme radicals&#8217; insane attacks. </p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, outside Landmark North, a group of black-clad mobsters launched rabid assaults on residents who were clearing the roadblocks, when a 70-year-old worker with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department was hit in the head by a hard object hurled by the rioters. The worker was immediately knocked down onto the ground and sustained severe head injury. He later died in hospital on late Thursday. </p>
<p>Such anti-human atrocity of indiscriminate killing is inhuman and intolerable, the official said in a statement, adding that the liaison office conveyed deep condolences over the death of the worker, offered sympathy to his family and expressed grave indignation and strong condemnation against such frenzy violence. &#8220;The liaison office firmly supports the HKSAR government and Hong Kong police in severely punishing the perpetrators according to law to demonstrate the rule of law and justice,&#8221; said the statement. </p>
<p>The official pointed out that as violence in Hong Kong has escalated recently, rioters have resorted to inhumane use of terror in disregard of people&#8217;s lives, which seriously threatened life and property safety of Hong Kong residents and made everyone in Hong Kong feel insecure. The entire Hong Kong is now shrouded in &#8220;black terror.&#8221; </p>
<p>The bloody facts have shown that the chaos in Hong Kong cannot be allowed any longer, otherwise each and every resident would be put under severe threat. All Hong Kong people must resolutely draw a line with violence and jointly safeguard the rule of law and maintain social stability, said the official. </p>
<p>The official noted that more and more residents have stood out to spontaneously clear the barricades, protect seniors and children who were crossing roads, as well as encourage the police officers on patrol. What they do is a reflection of the aspirations of Hong Kong people longing to end fear and restore peace. </p>
<p>The liaison office paid tribute to these ordinary people and hoped more people who love Hong Kong can come out and say no to violence with their concrete actions and show strong positive energy in resuming social order, he said.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s second import fair ended on a high note on Sunday with a flurry of contract announcements achieved during the week-long expo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The harvest of the nation&#8217;s opening-up gives the bleak global economy a much-needed infusion of hope. It should persuade some of the obstinate proponents of conspiracy theories to stop harping on negative factors and instead devote themselves to an exploration of opportunities out there in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>While the official figures are yet to be announced for deals having been signed at the second China International Import Expo (CIIE), there&#8217;s every chance that the total would be bigger than in the first session. That would be quite an extraordinary feat, factoring in the bruising trade woes that have weighed on the global economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take General Electric Co (GE), a second-timer at the fair. GE Aviation, a subsidiary of the US conglomerate, and its joint venture CFM International signed engine purchase and services deals worth over $1.86 billion with multiple Chinese airlines and aircraft manufacturers during the expo, industry news site caacnews.com.cn reported on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, GE Renewable Energy, a Paris-based subsidiary of GE, announced on Wednesday it signed a deal at the expo &#8211; GE&#8217;s largest-ever wind order in Asia &#8211; to build a 715-megawatt wind farm in Central China&#8217;s Henan Province.</p>
<p>GE is merely a small part of the US business community, which showed strong interest in the world&#8217;s first national-level import fair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, more US businesses attended the second expo and took up the largest exhibition area among all the participating countries and regions, according to the Xinhua News Agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, some observers who have become used to viewing China with a jaundiced eye, typically seen in an AFP article on Tuesday and another piece by CNBC on Thursday, still spared no effort to belittle the expo as a big show hyped by China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AFP report said the expo is of &#8220;little use,&#8221; citing survey results by the European Union Chamber of Commerce last Monday, which claimed members of the chamber were not impressed by their participation at the expo last year in terms of the resultant business agreements and the realization of the deals. The complaints appear to contradict Chinese official data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that an increasing number of businesses were drawn to the event actually speaks loudly to the benefits that the CIIE could generate in the real business world. With the likes of GE securing high-profile deals at the second expo, it is strong proof of how global interests can be served through the unique platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China could also do more to make sure the business agreements are put into practice. There may have been some buck-passing and delays when foreign investors are trying to implement the contracts. But China is making efforts to solve these problems. The country on Friday rolled out 20 opinions in expanding opening-up to provide a fair, transparent and predictable climate for foreign companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China values the opinion of foreign companies. The Chinese government is determined to clear the path to improve policy efficiency and make agreements better realized. Negativity is of little use. It&#8217;s time for chronic complainers and conspiracy theorists to change their thinking. Joint effort is needed for push through contract implementation and help opening-up go into practice.</p>
