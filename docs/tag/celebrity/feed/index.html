<p>Clive James, the Australian broadcaster, writer, critic and poet who charmed generations of Britons with his humor and wit, has died at the age of 80, his agents said Wednesday.</p>
<p>James died &#8220;peacefully and at home, surrounded by his family and his books&#8221; in Cambridge, eastern England, on Sunday, United Agents said in a statement.</p>
<p>A private funeral attended by family and close friends took place on Wednesday in the chapel at Pembroke College in Cambridge University, where he read English literature as a student in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The charismatic and erudite broadcaster, who left Sydney for England in late 1961 and made his career in Britain, had fought a long battle with leukemia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clive died almost 10 years after his first terminal diagnosis and one month after he laid down his pen for the last time,&#8221; UA said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He endured his ever-multiplying illnesses with patience and good humor, knowing until the last moment that he had experienced more than his fair share of this &#8216;great, good world.'&#8221;</p>
<p>He made his name as The Observer newspaper&#8217;s TV critic for a decade from 1972, where he turned the TV review into somewhat of an art form.</p>
<p>His own hit TV show,<br />
<em>Clive James on Television</em>, fronted with his wise-cracking presenting style, put some the world&#8217;s most bizarre programs under the spotlight &#8211; notably clips of the Japanese game show<br />
<em>Endurance</em>.</p>
<p>Another regular guest was the Cuban singer Margarita Pracatan, who paid tribute on Wednesday to James&#8217; intelligence, talent &#8220;and beautiful way of living.&#8221;</p>
<p>James pioneered the &#8220;postcard&#8221; format of travel documentaries.</p>
<p>He retired from mainstream television in 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Penned his own obituary</strong></p>
<p>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), presented him with a special lifetime achievement award in 2015.</p>
<p>BBC Director-General Tony Hall said: &#8220;Clive James was a clever, witty and thought-provoking broadcaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a huge range of talents and everything he did was essential listening or viewing. He is irreplaceable.&#8221;</p>
<p>James wrote several novels and poetry books and received the Philip Hodgins Memorial Medal, a major Australian literature award, in 2003.</p>
<p>He published several volumes of his memoirs, including<br />
<em>The Blaze of Obscurity</em> about his years in television.</p>
<p>After an unsuccessful operation to remove a cancer on his cheek in February this year, James set about compiling an autobiographical anthology of poems called<br />
<em>The Fire Of Joy</em>, which was finished a month ago.</p>
<p>During his long illness, James penned his own obituary, regularly updating it on his website.</p>
<p>He said it would &#8220;serve as a cheaper obituary than anything most newspapers are likely to have in the freezer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will keep updating it until they carry me to the slab, during which journey I will try to give details of my final medication,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Miller dies, 85</strong></p>
<p>James&#8217; death was announced after the family of theater director Jonathan Miller said he died on Wednesday at the age of 85.</p>
<p>Miller once appeared as a guest on James&#8217; chat show<br />
<em>The Late Clive James</em> in 1988, in which he discussed his love of stationery.</p>
<p>The polymath first found fame in the early 1960s in the revue<br />
<em>Beyond The Fringe</em> with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.</p>
<p>Miller directed theater and television plays, including<br />
<em>The Merchant Of Venice</em> at the National Theatre and six of BBC television&#8217;s Shakespeare plays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our father died this morning peacefully at home with his family around him following a long battle with Alzheimer&#8217;s,&#8221; Miller&#8217;s family said in a statement.</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s National Theatre called Miller a &#8220;legendary figure across theater and opera,&#8221; while the English National Opera said &#8220;his contribution to comedy, theater and ENO in particular was immeasurable.</p>
<p>&#8220;For over four decades Jonathan created some of ENO&#8217;s most celebrated and popular opera productions.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at a New York City police department precinct to turn himself in to face multiple charges related to allegations of sexual assault on Friday. According to reports, Weinstein is facing charges of first-degree rape and third-degree rape in one case, and first-degree criminal sex act in another case. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>A New York judge has ruled that<br />
<em>The Sopranos</em> actress Annabella Sciorra is allowed to testify at fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s trial, court documents showed Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a decision filed late Tuesday, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke also denied a last-ditch attempt by Weinstein&#8217;s attorneys to have predatory sexual assault charges against their client dropped.</p>
<p>Weinstein &#8211; once one of the most powerful men in Hollywood &#8211; has pleaded not guilty to five charges of sexual assault relating to two women.</p>
<p>His trial is scheduled to start on January 6, 2020. He faces life in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>One of the women alleges Weinstein raped her in 2013, while the other claims he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006.</p>
<p>His lawyers had sought to prevent prosecutors from calling a third woman, who alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein over the winter of 1993-94, to give evidence.</p>
<p>Burke rejected their request.</p>
<p>The woman is not named in court documents but it widely understood to be Sciorra, 59.</p>
<p>She helped trigger the #MeToo movement in October 2017 when she told The New Yorker magazine that Weinstein raped her at her home in Manhattan in 1993.</p>
<p>Weinstein, 67, cannot be charged with raping Sciorra because the statute of limitations has expired. Prosecutors hope that her giving evidence as a corroborating witness will strengthen their case.</p>
<p>Weinstein has been accused of harassment and assault by more than 80 women, including stars such as Ashley Judd.</p>
<p>The co-founder of Miramax and producer of<br />
<em>Pulp Fiction</em>, has always insisted his sexual relationships were consensual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy 19th birthday, and hope you are happy every day!&#8221; Roy Wang (Wang Yuan), a member of Chinese boy band TFBoys, sent out birthday wishes exactly at midnight on Thursday on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below the text was a photo of Jackson Yee, who is also part of the three-member boy band. In the picture, the smiling Yee holds a photoshopped cake in his hand, apparently, the work of Wang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four minutes later, Karry Wang (Wang Junkai), another member of the band, posted, &#8220;Happy 19th birthday, hope every day in the future goes well and is filled with happiness. Hope you can do more things that you love.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his post, Karry Wang attached a photo of Yee enjoying hot pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the same thread, Karry Wang later posted, &#8220;Due to a delay in the network in Switzerland, I failed to send out birthday wishes right on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wang&#8217;s birthday wishes drew Chinese netizen&#8217;s attention. Related hashtags have earned 320 million views and 61,000 posts in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debuting in 2013, the three have been working together for about six years. As the trio have transformed from ordinary teens to China&#8217;s most influential stars, they have appeared less frequently on stage together as they have gradually shifted focus to their individual careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wang is currently studying music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, while Karry Wang is attending the Beijing Film Academy. As for Yee, who is studying at the Central Academy of Drama, he recently gained huge success with his first film role in the coming-of-age drama<br />
<em>Better Days</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Chinese fans also sent out their own birthday wishes, they were warmed by the trio&#8217;s display of friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The relationship among the three &#8211; Karry Wang, Roy Wang and Jackson Yee &#8211; is a kind of brotherhood. They are still so close to each other!&#8221; one netizen wrote in a post on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>Music industry mogul Scooter Braun said Friday his dispute with megastar Taylor Swift over her music catalogue has left his family receiving &#8220;death threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 29-year-old pop artist began publicly sparring with Braun this summer over his company&#8217;s purchase of her former label, Big Machine Label Group, which gave him a majority stake in the master recordings of her first six albums.</p>
<p>Last week, Swift &#8211; known for her calculating social media strategy &#8211; said on Tumblr that Big Machine heads were &#8220;exercising tyrannical control,&#8221; claiming they were preventing her from performing at an upcoming awards gala and releasing a Netflix documentary including songs from her early catalogue.</p>
<p>In the post she pleaded with her fans and fellow artists to back her cause.</p>
<p>Braun had not publicly spoken out on the matter, but early Friday dropped a lengthy Instagram post saying Swift&#8217;s appeal had resulted in &#8220;numerous death threats directed at my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I assume this was not your intention but it is important that you understand that your words carry a tremendous amount of weight,&#8221; Braun wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;While disappointed that you have remained silent after being notified by your attorney 4 days ago of these ongoing threats, I&#8217;m still hopeful that we can fix this.&#8221;</p>

</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Michael Jackson fans attend a screening of <em>Square One</em> on Sunday in Beijing. Photo: Courtesy of mjjcn.com</p>
<p>Chinese Michael Jackson fans paid tribute to the singer following the screening of Chinese-Canadian Danny Wu&#8217;s documentary<br />
<em>Square One</em> in Beijing on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film is an investigation into 1993 allegations of sexual abuse against Jackson brought by the family of the alleged victim Jordan Chandler. It uncovers new evidence and information in defense of the singer through interviews with the people closest to the case, such as Jackson&#8217;s nephew and the legal assistant to the accuser&#8217;s lawyers in 1993.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Square One</em> premiered in Hollywood on September 28 and in London on October 5. That same day, it made its global debut on Wu&#8217;s YouTube channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In LA, the biggest shock to me was how many people showed up. And you know there were a lot of high-profile people over there. They were Hollywood actors. They were big YouTube stars, Michael Jackson&#8217;s lawyers, his family… I got a standing ovation in the end which surprised me as well. In London, same thing. People were more reserved, standing ovation at the end, which I didn&#8217;t expect at all,&#8221; Wu told the Global Times after the screening and a Q&amp;A session with the audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feeling connected</strong></p>
<p>With support from China&#8217;s biggest Jackson fan website, mjjcn.com, the documentary&#8217;s Chinese-subtitled version was screened in eight cities across China including Shanghai, Shenzhen and Chengdu, with Beijing the last stop. Tickets for the film sold out quickly, as the tour attracted a multitude of the late singer&#8217;s fans in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the most connected fan groups I&#8217;ve ever seen anywhere. Because, not only are they online, but they are also going to meet up in real life having real life interactions, which does not happen very often in the West,&#8221; said Wu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wu attended screenings in different cities and enjoyed the discussions with audiences, most of whom were Michael Jackson fans. After the screening, one fan said that the film felt like a redemption for the singer as it presents the truth to the public, while a mother said she brought her 11-year-old son with her, hoping he&#8217;d learn more about Jackson as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see how connected they feel to Michael Jackson. I realize that this is way beyond music and dance. This is people really connecting to him at a deeper level. I don&#8217;t think I really understood that until this trip,&#8221; Wu added.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Doing some digging</strong></p>
<p>Premiering at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on January 25,<br />
<em>Leaving Neverland</em> featured accounts from two former child stars Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who accused the late singer of sexually assaulting them in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In its review, Variety said it &#8220;offers devastatingly powerful and convincing testimony that Michael Jackson was guilty of child sexual abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wu watched<br />
<em>Leaving Neverland</em> as well. He said that after noticing what he felt were a lot of inconsistencies in the film, he started doing research on his own. In April, he posted on his YouTube channel his interviews with Taj Jackson, Michael Jackson&#8217;s nephew, and Brandi Jackson, the pop star&#8217;s niece in a piece titled<br />
<em> Returning to Neverland: Taj and Brandi Jackson Interview</em>. Wu noted that the interviews received quite a bit of attention from Jackson fans, which he thinks helped gain people&#8217;s trust as an investigator on YouTube.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2005, Jackson was faced with a second child molestation case, which ended up with his acquittal. Wu said that during the trial, he heard that more than one person who knew Chandler testified in court saying that Chandler told them that nothing had ever happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one ever confirmed [that people had testified]. But it just became my obsession to find one of these names. And I looked into it for a long time. And I got a name, there was Josephine Zohny,&#8221; said Wu.</p>
<p>It took Wu some effort to talk Zohny into defending Jackson publicly. After his interview with her, Wu realized that one witness may not be convincing enough so he changed his format and turn his YouTube series into a documentary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the West, all the online discussions about whether Michael Jackson was guilty or not. All the people who think he was guilty, they always go back to one point. Why did he pay the settlement? Why did he pay a kid 20 million dollars? So that was the root of all the problems… But the 1993 case has never gone to trial. So there are a lot of myths and legends around that case. So I just kept building around it. I kept adding new people in, and people kept dropping out,&#8221; he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To be continued</strong></p>
<p>Wu and Michael Jackson&#8217;s Chinese fans believe in the singer&#8217;s innocence and plan to show their support by promoting<br />
<em>Square One</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The documentary will soon be screened in Amsterdam, and a new version different from the YouTube version will likely be available on Amazon Prime in the US in January 2020. As for China, mjjcn.com is considering collaborating with a domestic video-streaming website to screen the film.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad used to bring DVDs of Michael Jackson dancing. And he was like &#8216;Yeah, let me show you something impressive.&#8217; And we just watched Michael Jackson DVDs all day. So that&#8217;s like a very big part of my childhood. I feel I owe so much happiness to Michael Jackson for this family time so that it&#8217;s only right I&#8217;m doing this now,&#8221; said Wu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked what he&#8217;d say to the singer, Wu answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying my best. I&#8217;m doing my part. And I hope that can be appreciated and maybe the world one day will see you for who you really are.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski faced mounting pressure Sunday after threatening to sue over claims by a former actress that he violently raped her in the 1970s, the latest in a string of sexual assault accusations against him.</p>
<p>The 86-year-old filmmaker rejected the allegation, but few from the world of French cinema have come out in support of Polanski, who fled to France in 1978 after admitting to raping a 13-year-old girl at the Los Angeles home of Jack Nicholson.</p>
<p>Jean Dujardin, the star of Polanski&#8217;s latest film, which comes out in France on Wednesday, has abruptly canceled a prime-time interview on the TF1 television station set for Sunday.</p>
<p>And the French artists&#8217; guild ARP could meet soon to discuss his exclusion, its vice president told the Parisien newspaper.</p>
<p>An ARP spokesman later told AFP that although no board meeting had been set, &#8220;If we are going to decide on Roman Polanski&#8217;s membership, we will do so with the approval of filmmakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valentine Monnier, a photographer and former actress, has accused Polanski, who is French-Polish, of an &#8220;extremely violent&#8221; assault and rape at his chalet in the Swiss ski resort of Gstaad in 1975, when she was 18.</p>
<p>Monnier said he tried to make her swallow a pill during the attack, and later made a tearful apology while demanding a promise that she never tell anyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I was going to die,&#8221; she said in an open letter published by Le Parisien, which also interviewed her and said it had contacted witnesses who confirmed the account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr Polanski disputes in the strongest terms this rape accusation,&#8221; his lawyer Herve Temime told AFP in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working on the legal action to bring against this publication,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Criminal past&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>The rape claim has rocked a French film industry already reeling after a top actress last week said she was sexually harassed by the director of her first film when she was just 12.</p>
<p>Adele Haenel, whose account has garnered an outpouring of support, on Saturday urged others to speak out in support of Monnier and &#8220;take notice of her story.&#8221;</p>
<p>French prosecutors have opened a sexual assault investigation into Haenel&#8217;s claims, even though Haenel herself never filed a legal complaint.</p>
<p>Polanski and his new film,<br />
<em>An Officer and a Spy</em>, had already courted controversy in September when it was included in the Venice film festival, where it took second place.</p>
<p>Monnier, who acted in a few films in the 1980s, said the release of the film, about one of the most notorious errors of justice in French history, the Dreyfus affair, had prompted her to finally speak out.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could he benefit from public funds to instrumentalize history, and in doing so rewrite his own to cover up his criminal past?&#8221; she wrote, referring to French subsidies for film productions.</p>
<p>&#8220;He pummelled me until I gave in and then raped me, making me do all sorts of things,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>She had previously written to France&#8217;s first lady Brigitte Macron, who forwarded two letters to France&#8217;s equality minister Marlene Schiappa, who has pushed for new measures to combat sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Schiappa wrote to Monnier in March 2018 and hailed her courage &#8220;in daring to break the silence,&#8221; though the alleged attack was beyond France&#8217;s statute of limitations for prosecution.</p>
<p>But her account may prove a turning point for French cinema, where the MeToo movement against rape and sexual assault that roiled Hollywood has not prompted as deep a reckoning of abuses in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Oscar outlaw</strong></p>
<p>Monnier is the first Frenchwoman to accuse Polanski of rape. Since he was arrested in California in 1977 on charges of drugging and raping 13-year-old Samantha Gailey, now known as Samantha Geimer, five other women including Monnier have come forward to allege that he either raped or sexually assaulted them.</p>
<p>He has denied all the claims, but they forced him to abandon the presidency of the 2017 Cesars, the French equivalent of the Oscars, and the following year he was expelled from the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Alain Terzian, president of France&#8217;s APC film promotion association which oversees the Cesars, which includes Polanski as a member, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Both France and Poland have refused to extradite Polanski to the US, where California prosecutors are pressing their case even after Polanski paid Geimer $225,000 in an out-of-court settlement in 1994.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Geimer criticized Monnier for not speaking up sooner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking heat for not being more supportive of accusers who use film release dates to schedule their revelations with the press &amp; sat silently while I was called a liar &amp; a gold digging whore in 1977 knowing they may have prevented it, if they had the truth &amp; my mom&#8217;s courage,&#8221; she wrote on Saturday.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Fan Shijin Photo: Courtesy of Yilin Press</p>
<p>A biography of Fan Jinshi, honorary director and fellow of the Dunhuang Academy, made its debut at a book release ceremony at Peking University in Beijing on Monday.</p>
<p>The book,<br />
<em>Dunhuang is Where My Heart Belongs: Biology of Fan Shijin</em>, explores Fan&#8217;s personal life experience and her relationship with one of China&#8217;s famous World Cultural Heritage sites: the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang, Northwest China&#8217;s Gansu Province.</p>
<p>Fan said one of the difficulties that the Mogao Grottoes have had to deal with has been balancing protection of the site and its many murals with the development of tourism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cultural relics benefit tourism, but they are non-renewable resources. We have to give priority to protection efforts, which can give visitors the wrong impression that we do not welcome them, such as when we limit visitor numbers,&#8221; Fan said, adding that digitization of the murals and other art inside the Mogao Grottoes have helped relieve the pressure from a large&nbsp;number&nbsp;of tourists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very delighted that more young people are showing an interest in archaeology and choosing it as a major. You know, only a few people studied archaeology back in our generation&#8217;s day,&#8221; Fan told the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fan said the Mogao Grottoes contain both Chinese and foreign cultural elements and that an increasing number of foreign archaeologists have been heading there to carry out research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We now have employees from about 30 majors in Dunhuang culture, and we need more interdisciplinary talent and welcome more domestic and foreign scholars to come to Dunhuang to figure out the unsolved mysteries of the Mogao Grottoes,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Growing up in East China&#8217;s Shanghai Municipality, Fan majored in archaeology at Peking University. After graduation she was assigned to work in Dunhuang. At the age of 60, Fan was appointed as the dean of the Dunhuang Academy, and later retired at 80 years old. She earned the honorary title of the People&#8217;s Republic of China and gained the national medal at the Great Hall of the People on September 29.</p>
<p>As an explorer and guardian of Dunhuang&#8217;s cultural relics, she established a chronological catalog of the Mogao Grottoes. She took the lead in establishing regulations for cultural relic protection throughout the country and made significant contributions to the permanent preservation and sustainable use of the Mogao Grottoes.</p>
<p>Fan said that she felt the biography was also part of her responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ancestors left such a unique and profound cultural heritage&nbsp;to us, and we have the duty to protect them and leave them to the next generation. I spent almost my entire life protecting the Mogao Grottoes, and I also feel obligated to turn my work experience of 50 years into a text to record the history of Dunhuang,&#8221; Fan said at the book launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book was co-written by Gu Zifang, a professor at the School of Arts at Peking University. She spent four years finishing the book. She listened to Fan&#8217;s stories and spent a lot of time reading articles related to Fan and the Mogao Grottoes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very honored to write a book for our respected teacher Fan. We chatted on the phone for many days and nights. Fan opened her heart to me without reservation, which gave me the freedom to write,&#8221; Gu said at the book launch. She noted that Fan and Dunhuang are inseparable and that if she had written about Fan without mentioning Mogao Grottoes, it would not have been a complete and true picture of this influential figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest difficulty for me was that I am not an archaeologist. So when it came to the professional terms in this field, I needed to check a lot of information, making sure the words and times were accurate,&#8221; Gu told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Poster of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Photo: IC</p>
<p>According to a report from the Hollywood Reporter, US film director Quentin Tarantino will not be re-cutting his<br />
<em> Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em> for the Chinese mainland. Originally set for release on Friday, the film was suspended indefinitely a week before its release by Chinese regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tarantino, who has final-cut rights for the film in his contract, refused to cooperate with Chinese authorities when the film&#8217;s co-producer Bona Film Group asked him to help re-edit the film in order to re-approve the release, according to a report from film news site Cinema Blend on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Reporter reported that the suspension came after Bruce Lee&#8217;s daughter Shannon Lee made a direct appeal to China&#8217;s National Film Administration to have her father&#8217;s controversial portrayal in the film changed. No official statement about the suspension has been made by any parties involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally do not think that Shannon Lee, as one of the films&#8217; biggest critics, is the main reason stopping the film&#8217;s release in the Chinese mainland, because according to the reaction and feedback from those who have seen the film, Tarantino&#8217;s use of Bruce Lee&#8217;s image is rather biased and even an insult,&#8221; Shi Wenxue, a film critic and teacher at the Beijing Film Academy, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>The film portrays Bruce Lee as an arrogant person who claims he could have &#8220;crippled&#8221; Muhammad Ali in a fight, yet loses in a fight to Brad Pitt&#8217;s Cliff Booth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bruce Lee worked on screen to change the US stereotype of Chinese. However, after half a century, we see the expression of such a stereotype, which is unacceptable,&#8221; Shi said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shannon Lee once told The Wrap in July that she found the film &#8220;disheartening.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand they want to make the Brad Pitt character this super bad-ass who could beat up Bruce Lee. But they didn&#8217;t need to treat him in the way that white Hollywood did when he was alive.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She added that &#8220;It was really uncomfortable to sit in the theater and listen to people laugh at my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hashtag related to Shannon Lee&#8217;s dissatisfaction about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has earned 310 million views on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo as of Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bruce Lee&#8217;s overconfidence and arrogant image in the film is a typical stereotype applied to Chinese in Hollywood movies. Bruce Lee spent his whole life bringing real Chinese characters to the world, but Tarantino brought this old image into his film again, which is shameful to us Chinese,&#8221; one Chinese netizen commented on Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Shi, Chinese often play the role of gang members in Chinatown, or arrogant rich second-generation Chinese in Western film and television. For example, the Asian characters in the film<br />
<em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> catered to the image many US viewers have when it comes to Asians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discrimination is also common off screen as well. For instance, Vietnamese-American actress Kelly Marie Tran, who played a role in<br />
<em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>, suffered racist attacks and personal abuse at the hands of Star Wars fans who were dissatisfied with her character in the film.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, some Chinese netizens have commented that the other reason for the suspension of the film may have been the violence on display in some scenes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quentin&#8217;s films often have a lot of swearing, bloody, violent, and erotic elements, which may cause concern among China&#8217;s reviewing authorities,&#8221; Shi said.</p>
<p>Although the film did original pass review, this is not the first time that one of the director&#8217;s films have been pulled at the last minute in the Chinese mainland. Tarantino&#8217;s<br />
<em>Django Unchained</em> debuted in mainland theaters back in 2013, but was subsequently pulled from cinemas on its first day of screening for &#8220;technical reason.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Leonardo da Vinci&#8217;s iconic drawing<em> Vitruvian Man</em> Photo: IC</p>
<p>An Italian court on Wednesday rejected a last-minute bid to halt the loan of Leonardo da Vinci&#8217;s iconic<br />
<em>Vitruvian Man</em> drawing and other works to France&#8217;s Louvre museum, ending a bitter cultural row.</p>
<p>The court last week suspended the loan of the world famous artwork, due to appear later this month in an exhibition at the Paris museum to mark the 500th anniversary of the artist&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>It did so after the group Italia Nostra (Our Italy) filed a complaint saying the drawing was too fragile to travel.</p>
<p>The drawing is insured for at least 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), Italian media have said.</p>
<p>The court in Venice cited &#8220;the exceptional global relevance of the [Louvre] exhibition and [Italy&#8217;s] desire to maximize its heritage potential&#8221; in overturning the bid to stop the loan of several Da Vinci works.</p>
<p><em>The Vitruvian Man</em> is kept in a climate-controlled vault in the Accademia Gallery in Venice and is rarely displayed to the public.</p>
<p>The 35 by 25 centimeter drawing depicts the proportions of the human body according to Roman architect Vitruvius.</p>
<p>A man is shown with his legs apart and together in two superimposed images within a square and a circle, in a supremely Renaissance combination of art and mathematics.</p>
<p>The court had put on hold an accord signed in September in Paris between Italy&#8217;s culture ministry and the Louvre for a swap of works for the Renaissance master&#8217;s quincentennial next year.</p>
<p>Rome is lending several Leonardo works to the Louvre for a major exhibition which opens next week.</p>
<p>In return, paintings and drawings by the Italian artist Raphael are to be loaned to Italy for an exhibition in the Italian capital in March.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now the great Italian-French cultural operation of the two exhibitions on Leonardo in Paris and Raphael in Rome can start,&#8221; Italy&#8217;s Cultural Heritage Minister Dario Franceschini tweeted after the court ruling.</p>
<p>The loan was already questioned by Italy&#8217;s former right-wing government, which railed against the idea of lending Da Vinci works to France.</p>
<p>The previous coalition government which included the far-right League had repeated disputes with France, in particular with President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> on immigration issues.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s court ruling hailed &#8220;the value of collaboration and exchange between States [and] the improved image and recognition of Venice&#8217;s Accademia Gallery.&#8221;</p>
<p>With fewer than 20 Leonardo paintings still in existence, many Italians are resentful that the Louvre possesses five of them, as well as 22 drawings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Renaissance genius was born in Tuscany in Italy, but died in the French town of Amboise in 1519, at the age of 67.</p>
<p>Italia Nostra said its motives were not political, but aimed at safeguarding a national treasure. It said the Vitruvian Man risked tearing and those who had agreed for it to travel had not removed it from its case to examine it.</p>

<p>Chinese netizens took to social media to post messages of sorrow after news broke that Choi Jin-ri (better known as Sulli), a South Korean singer and former member of South Korean girl group f(x), had passed away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Seongnam Fire Department has revealed more news about Sulli&#8217;s sudden passing to the press. Sulli was already deceased prior to the arrival of the paramedics. According to the police, Sulli&#8217;s manager last spoke on the phone with her on Sunday until roughly 6 PM and had not heard from her since, then they decided to go to her residence to check up on her, Allkpop reported.</p>
<p>According to reports, the K-pop star&#8217;s manager found the 25-year-old singer dead at her home in Sujeong-gu, Seongnam in the Gyeonggi province of South Korea. Police are investigating the cause of death on the assumption she took her own life, according to a report from South Korean news agency Yonhap.</p>
<p>Sulli once revealed that she has panic disorder and social phobia during the reality show Jinro Store, Yonhap reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hashtag for Sulli&#8217;s death quickly earned more than 280 million views on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo in just a short while after the news broke. Some Chinese netizens noticed that Sina Weibo&#8217;s search function crashed for a time, which they speculate was due to the sheer amount of posts related to the news.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Chinese netizens were shocked by the news and called for people to treasure life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe Sulli is gone now. I just hope she has found peace after all the hardships she has gone through. And those who always attack her online please stop and be polite,&#8221; one Chinese netizen commented on Sina Weibo.</p>
