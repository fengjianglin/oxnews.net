<p>China&#8217;s top legislature on Friday passed a highly anticipated new foreign investment law, paving the way for an overhaul of the country&#8217;s regulatory system for foreign investment that would offer investors greater access and better protection.</p>
<p>The 13th National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC) voted to adopt the draft foreign investment law, in one of the most important legislative achievements from this year&#8217;s NPC annual session, which concluded on Friday.</p>
<p>President Xi Jinping signed a presidential decree to promulgate the law.</p>
<p>The new law would replace three existing laws on various types of foreign investment and become the first unified legal standard for foreign investment activities in the country.</p>
<p>The law enjoyed overwhelming support at the NPC, with 2,929 deputies voting for the passage of the law, eight against and eight abstentions. The law will come into effect on 1 January 2020.</p>
<p>After deliberation on the draft law, lawmakers made seven amendments, including adding a clause to prohibit administrative agencies and their employees from revealing commercial secretes, according to the Beijing News.</p>
<p>The amendments also included stronger language on protecting foreign firms&#8217; intellectual property rights (IPR), replacing a phrase about encouraging technology cooperation based on a volunteering principle and commercial rules, with one about taking strict legal actions against IPR infringement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consisting of 41 articles in 6 different parts, the law provides legal basis for various aspects of foreign investments from classification to management. Overall the law offers foreign investors equal treatment, greater access, and better legal protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The law] provides more comprehensive and equal treatment to foreign companies and is very modernized and also fitting for our country&#8217;s development,&#8221; Wong Yuk-shan, an NPC deputy and president of the Opening University of Hong Kong who voted for the law, told the Global Times on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law would improve the transparency in all aspects for foreign companies and will attract more [foreign investors] to China,&#8221; said Ian Fok Chun-wan, an NPC deputy from Hong Kong and CEO of the Fok Ying Tung Group.</p>
<p><strong>Actions to follow</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is expected to be followed by amended rules and regulations from the State Council, China&#8217;s cabinet, for implementation of the new law, said Kong Qingjiang, vice dean of the School of International Law at China University of Political Science and Law.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a basic law, which means it is not very specific and would likely require the State Council to set what&#8217;s known as the administrative regulations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The State Council will introduce a series of matching regulations and normative documents to protect foreign companies&#8217; rights and interests under the new law, Premier Li Keqiang said at a press conference on Friday, after the conclusion of the NPC session.</p>
<p>The State Council will release a shortened negative list for foreign investments, which means more sectors will be open to foreign companies, and propose revisions to laws governing IPR and set up a punitive mechanism to better protect foreign firms&#8217; IPR.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a word, China will further open up and China&#8217;s opening-up measures will not come on one time basis but will be introduced over time,&#8221; Li said.</p>
<p>Among the regulations, the State Council would likely draft new rules regarding the national security review of foreign investments and a negative list for foreign investors, Kong said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new changes made to the draft law also included a part that gives the State Council the power to draft specific rules for the implementation of the new law to ensure a proper transition period for foreign companies already operating in the country, according to the Beijing News.</p>
<p>But, Kong said, all the rules and regulations must be in line with the new law, which also underscored equal opportunity for foreign companies to government procurement and better services from all levels of governments to help foreign companies.</p>
<p>New amendments to the draft law further clarified those parts by adding services to government procurement of foreign goods, and adding streamlining administrative process and improving efficiency, to improve better services for foreign investors.</p>

<p></center><br />
<br />China&#8217;s top political advisory body vowed on Wednesday to provide high-quality political consultations and build a broad consensus to help the country better address complex international and domestic issues.</p>
<p>The 13th Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee concluded its annual sessions at the Great Hall of the People, capping off a 10-day annual meeting of more than 2,000 members, who discussed a wide range of issues in the country&#8217;s social and economic development.</p>
<p>At the closing ceremony, members passed three resolutions on the work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, a report on the examination of proposals from members and a political resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Opportunities and challenges are bound to be interwoven in 2019,&#8221; the political resolution said, calling on CPPCC members to undertake serious consultations and discussions and offer suggestions to major issues in China&#8217;s economic and social development.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must enhance and improve the CPPCC&#8217;s democratic oversight work and include oversight in consultations to help promote decisions and policies made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>During the annual session, CPPCC National Committee members submitted a total of 5,113 proposals that cover everything from economic development and politics, to culture and the environment, according to the report on the examination of proposals. More than 38 percent of the proposals focused on economic issues, such as stabilizing the economy and improving business conditions for the private sector.</p>
<p>Wang Haijing, a member of the CPPCC National Committee, said he felt the proposals were more &#8220;pragmatic and specific&#8221; this year. &#8220;With the proposals getting more and more pragmatic, the government&#8217;s response and implementation of the proposals are also getting better,&#8221; he told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The proposals will be assigned to relevant government agencies and the CPPCC National Committee will oversee the implementation of some&nbsp; important proposals, the report said.</p>
<p>In a speech at the closing ceremony on Wednesday, CPPCC National Committee Chairman Wang Yang called on members to take responsibility. &#8220;There are no honorary members, there are only responsible members,&#8221; he said, calling on members to improve their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year, there is a much bigger focus on the quality of the work of [the CPPCC National Committee] members,&#8221; Yang Yunyan, a member of the CPPCC National Committee, told the Global Times on Wednesday.&nbsp;&#8220;The demand [for members] is much higher and more specific.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yang, who is also a deputy governor of Central China&#8217;s Hubei Province, said that in the past, being a CPPCC National Committee member was more of an honorary position, &#8220;but there is a much stronger sense of responsibility and sense of mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from improving the quality of their proposals, CPPCC National Committee members should also work to rally broader support across the country and among Chinese communities across the world to support the country&#8217;s economic and social development goals, Wang said. &#8220;Unity is the key to victory in tackling difficulties.&#8221;<br />

<p>China&#8217;s draft supervision law was submitted for its third reading at the national legislature Tuesday, aiming at a centralized, unified, authoritative and efficient supervisory network under the Party&#8217;s leadership. </p>
<p>The new law, an essential part of China&#8217;s reform of supervisory institutions, is expected to serve as a fundamental and guiding law against corruption and for state supervision, said Li Jianguo, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC), when elaborating the bill to the 13th NPC. </p>
<p>The law is aimed at enhancing the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on anti-corruption campaigns, he stressed. </p>
<p>According to the bill, new supervisory commissions will be established at the national, provincial, city and county levels. Tasked to handle job-related crimes, they will independently exercise supervisory power, and not be subject to interference from the government, social organizations and individuals. </p>
<p>The commissions are entrusted to oversee state functionaries, investigate corruption cases such as bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power, impose administrative penalty on corrupt officials, and hand over criminal cases to prosecutors, according to the bill. </p>
<p>&#8220;In face of a tough and complicated situation, our existing supervisory institutions were clearly unable to meet the demands of the battle against corruption and the campaign to clean up the Party,&#8221; Li said. </p>
<p>Under the old supervisory system, the Party disciplinary network oversaw all Party members and the administrative supervisory agencies governed civil servants, which left a considerable number of state functionaries unsupervised. </p>
<p>The supervisory power was also divided among three agencies, with the Party disciplinary agencies regulating Party members according to Party rules, administrative supervisory agencies watching civil servants according to the administrative supervision law, and procuratorates prosecuting state functionaries suspected of corruption according to the criminal procedure law. </p>
<p>&#8220;The agencies, with their power divided and overlapping, did not function in harmony,&#8221; Li said, adding that procuratorates, which not only investigate but also prosecute, were not under effective supervision. </p>
<p>Under the reform, supervision, corruption control and prevention divisions under the government and procuratorates are merged, pooling anti-graft resources together. </p>
<p>The new law also aims to legalize a unified system between state supervision and Party disciplinary inspection. </p>
<p>Since 80 percent of civil servants and 95 percent of leading officials are Party members, the tasks of Party internal inspection and state supervision highly overlap, requiring a more unified supervisory system, Li said. </p>
<p>New supervisory commissions will share staff and offices with the Party disciplinary inspection agencies. </p>
<p>The draft law has incorporated practices of the pilot reform of supervisory system, which began in Beijing, Shanxi and Zhejiang in December 2016, and then was expanded nationwide in November 2017, Li said. </p>
<p>Among the new practices in the pilot reform, a new detention system has been tested to replace the practice of &#8220;shuang gui,&#8221; an intra-party disciplinary practice, exercised by Party disciplinary officials, where a Party member under investigation must cooperate with questioning at a set time and place. </p>
<p>&#8220;Replacing&#8217;shuang gui&#8217; with rigorously-regulated detention will help settle a long-lingering legal problem,&#8221; Li said. &#8220;This has displayed our resolve and confidence to realize a full law-based governance.&#8221; </p>
<p>As of now, supervisory commissions have been founded at the provincial, city and county levels across the country.</p>
