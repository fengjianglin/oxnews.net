<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Song Liuping, chief legal officer of Huawei, speaks at a press conference at the company&#8217;s headquarters in Shenzhen, China, on Thursday. Huawei has filed a lawsuit challenging a recent US Federal Communications Commission. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Amid legal disputes and an escalated crackdown by Washington, Huawei has not stopped moving forward to defend its rights, a rational and legitimate way to win the battle against the US as well as the hearts of&nbsp;the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei announced it is suing the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday, asking to overturn the latest restrictions limiting the Chinese firm&#8217;s market access to rural America. It was Huawei&#8217;s second legal challenge against the US in a year, though the company has been used by Washington as a leverage amid the US-China trade war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its latest legal move, Huawei filed a petition with the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, seeking to reverse an FCC order passed on November 2 which bans carriers from purchasing Huawei equipment through a federal subsidy plan, citing national security concerns, the Chinese company announced at a press conference in Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangzhou Province on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has become the world&#8217;s largest telecoms equipment vendor, holding over 25 percent of market share. It has also been a leading force in 5G network roll-outs, as it was ranked first in technology contributions to 5G standards.</p>
<p>The FCC&#8217;s latest decision labeling Huawei a national security threat, forbidding small, mostly rural carriers, from purchasing its equipment through Universal Service Fund subsidies, has come as part of broader efforts by current US administration to suppress Huawei.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banning Huawei from building 5G networks would delay the roll-out of the next generation of wireless technologies in the US by six to 18 months, which would lead to $240 billion in the country&#8217;s GDP losses, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Growing controversies</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some analysts see Huawei&#8217;s lawsuit as finally &#8220;showing its claws&#8221; after the Chinese telecoms giant has been repeatedly placed under scrutiny and sanctions by the US government, at a time when China-US relations are imperiled by a protracted trade war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington has been escalating its crackdown against Huawei. For example, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been urging European countries to reject Huawei and ZTE on excuse of security risks, while the some in the Trump administration has even considered the &#8220;nuclear&#8221; option to ban the firm from the US banking system, media reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The logo of China&#8217;s tech giant Huawei. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Furthermore, some Western media claimed that the Chinese firm, as a rallying point for patriotism amid the trade war, began losing the sympathy of the Chinese public as it has been facing a backlash in the country over the 251-day detention of one of its former employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, the lack of detailed evidence in the case of Li Hongyuan, the company&#8217;s former employee jailed allegedly for extortion, made it bewildering, but it did not subdue public&#8217;s support for Huawei in suing the US federal institution. &#8220;Huawei sues FCC&#8221; is among the top 10 most searched topic on Chinese Twitter-like Weibo on Thursday, viewed 140 million times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people support Li&#8217;s lawsuit against Huawei, now Huawei has set an example,&#8221; a Weibo user said. As Li harshly criticized Huawei&#8217;s alleged wrongdoings, the Chinese company replied that it supports Li&#8217;s handling of the dispute through legal measures, which was considered by some as a cold PR response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too early to draw any conclusion, as more details about the case are expected to be disclosed,&#8221; Fang Xingdong, founder of Beijing-based technology think tank ChinaLabs, told the Global Times. &#8220;The image of Huawei in Chinese people&#8217;s hearts has not changed,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Taking the initiative</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei challenged the constitutionality of the US government&#8217;s decision in March, as the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) not only restricts the Chinese firm from serving US customers, but also deprives it of opportunities to serve customers outside the US. The company once said it is compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nine months later, the firm challenged a US court&#8217;s decision, which would also test the spirit of the rule of law in the US, analysts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a legal attack and defense strategy. If Huawei only endures attacks but never fights back, it will lose its initiative. Even if Huawei loses its case, it will put pressure on the US,&#8221; Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the rule of law in the US, the end does not justify such unlawful means of the FCC, Glen Nager, Huawei&#8217;s lead counsel for the legal action, told reporters. &#8220;We are confident that the Fifth Circuit Court will vacate the commission&#8217;s order.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of so-called national security risks, the Chinese foreign ministry also raised questions about the standards and who defines them. &#8220;China can suspect that the US may issue an order to shut off a Boeing engine at will if we follow US logic,&#8221; Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the ministry, told a routine conference on Thursday, in response to US side&#8217;s statements on the participation of Huawei and ZTE in 5G.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCC said it declined to comment on the case when it was contacted by the Global Times on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While facing growing pressure from the US, Huawei senior executives are still committed to openness and collaboration, although uncertainties remain whether the Trump administration would impose tougher restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We insist on an open attitude to embrace globalization. If the law allows it, we&#8217;ll keep collaborating with US partners,&#8221; Song Liuping, Huawei&#8217;s chief legal officer, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is out on bail and remains under partial house arrest after she was detained last year at the behest of American authorities, leaves her home to attend a court hearing in Vancouver, on September 23. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Calls were still loud Sunday on Chinese social media for the release of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou one year after her arrest in Vancouver&nbsp;airport at the request of the US.</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s case has evolved to be a linchpin in a stalemate between China and Canada, Chinese observers say, noting that breakthroughs made by the Chinese telecommunications giant over the past year prove that the US attempt to contain Huawei&#8217;s achievements and China&#8217;s technological rise has and will continue to come to naught.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Cong Peiwu, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Canada, also paid a visit to Meng in Vancouver.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government is determined to protect the just and legitimate rights and interests of its citizens and enterprises, and will continue to urge the Canadian side to correct its mistake and take measures to solve the issue as soon as possible,&#8221; Cong said, as quoted in a statement posted Friday on the website of the Embassy in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great motherland and nearly 1.4 billion Chinese people are your staunchest supporters. We expect you to go back to China safe and sound at an early date,&#8221; the statement said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition proceedings for Meng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei&#8217;s daughter, are scheduled for January, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei has yet to respond to&nbsp;the Global Times&#8217; request for disclosure on the progress of the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detention of Meng has deeply hurt China-Canada relations, and both Canada and the US have staked their international reputations on the case, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US request for Meng&#8217;s extradition from Canada is destined to end in failure, he believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extradition request was based on insufficient evidence, which means it would be impossible for the request to be justified in the Canadian legal system, Yang asserted.</p>
<p>A thorough and complicated procedure must be gone through before any extradition request is validated, he explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case will most likely either become &#8220;a protracted juridical war that may last 10 years or even longer,&#8221; or result in a solution that all the three sides involved can agree on, he added, stressing that the solution won&#8217;t be what the US wants.</p>
<p>Huawei has also become a bone of contention in the China-US trade tensions, during which the US has launched multiple offensives against Huawei.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A temporary experience store of Huawei in Shanghai on Saturday Photo: VCG</p>
<p>In the words of Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, China has not given in at the trade talks with the US and Huawei has not collapsed amid the US-initiated blockage.</p>
<p>In a fresh move, the US Federal Communications Commission announced a decision on November 22 barring the use of an $8.5 billion government fund to buy equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE on national security grounds.</p>
<p>Huawei said it would make an announcement at an event in its Shenzhen headquarters on Thursday about filing suit to challenge the FCC&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen-based technology giant has reportedly secured over 50 commercial 5G contracts across the globe, with 28 from Europe, 11 from the Middle East, six from the Asia-Pacific, four from the Americas, and one from Africa, the company revealed in&nbsp;September.</p>
<p>Huawei said it had delivered over 200,000 5G base stations and built nearly two-thirds of all 5G base stations shipped globally.</p>
<p>The US blockage has prompted Huawei to shift toward Japan for imports of chips and other core components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has pioneered the nation&#8217;s push for indigenous technological prowess, Xiang told the Global Times on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering Huawei&#8217;s flagship 5G system on a chip (SoC) as an example of the company&#8217;s edge over its global rivals in terms of core technology, Xiang reckoned the company has largely weathered the US attempt to contain Chinese tech products and solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest data from Berlin-based market intelligence platform IPlytics showed, as of November, Huawei&#8217;s declared 5G patents total 3,325, topping the global 5G declaration rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies following Huawei include Samsung with 2,846, LG with 2,463, Nokia with 2,308 and ZTE with 2,204.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highest-rated US company is Qualcomm at seventh 7th with 1,330 declared 5G patents.</p>

<p>Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng on Thursday summoned U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to lodge stern representations and strong protest against the United States signing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 into law.</p>
<p>&#8220;China strongly urges the U.S. to correct its mistake and make a fresh start, not to put the Act into effect, and immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs or interfering in China&#8217;s other internal affairs so as to avoid making further damages to bilateral ties and cooperation in important areas between China and the United States,&#8221; Le demanded.</p>
<p>As for the wrong move taken by the United States, China will take countermeasures in response and the U.S. must bear all the consequences that may ensue, he said.</p>
<p>The United States&#8217; signing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 into law is a severe interference in Hong Kong affairs, which are China&#8217;s internal affairs. It is also in serious violation of the international law and basic norms governing international relations. It is a gross hegemonic move, Le said, noting that the Chinese government and the people express strong indignation and firm opposition against it.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is part of China and Hong Kong affairs are China&#8217;s internal affairs, brooking no interference from any foreign government or force, he said.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has unswerving determination to defend national sovereignty, security and development interests, implement &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle and oppose any external force in interfering in Hong Kong affairs, Le stressed.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang on Monday summoned U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to lodge stern representations and strong protest against both the House of the Representatives and Senate passing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019.</p>
<p>China urges the United States to correct its mistake immediately, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China&#8217;s other internal affairs, Zheng said.</p>
<p>Reiterating that Hong Kong is part of China and Hong Kong affairs are purely China&#8217;s internal affairs, Zheng said the aforementioned act blatantly interferes in China&#8217;s internal affairs. He accused U.S. Congress of neglecting facts and truth, conniving at and supporting anti-China rabble rousers&#8217; violent crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in serious violation of international law and basic norms governing international relations. China strongly condemns and firmly opposes it,&#8221; said Zheng.</p>
<p>China has unswerving determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, to implement the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle and to oppose any external forces to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any attempts to put Hong Kong in chaos and destory Hong Kong&#8217;s stability and prosperity are doomed to fail, &#8221; said Zheng.</p>
<p>China strongly urges the United States to grasp the situation, immediately correct its mistake, prevent the act from becoming law and stop any words and deeds that interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China&#8217;s other internal affairs, the vice foreign minister said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise, the United States has to bear all the consequences that arise,&#8221; Zheng said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe (left) greets US Defense Secretary Mark Esper in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday. The two held their first face-to-face talks Monday. Photo: AP</p>
<p>The Taiwan question, foreign forces meddling in Hong Kong affairs and the South China Sea row &#8211; hot-button issues towering above China-US relations &#8211; came up at the meeting between Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and US Secretary of&nbsp; Defense Mark Esper in Bangkok on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wei underscored China&#8217;s dedication to resolving the Taiwan question peacefully and demanded the US to handle the issue with caution.</p>
<p>The Taiwan question has been used by the US to contain China. As long as there are tensions between the two countries, the US will keep provoking China on the Taiwan question.</p>
<p>The riots in Hong Kong have been going on for months. Given what we currently know, this is certainly not a local issue, and there must have been foreign forces behind it. Hong Kong has been practicing the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; policy, which is now facing a challenging time. China should prevent the US from using Hong Kong to interfere in the Taiwan question, affecting China&#8217;s security and stability, and peaceful reunification. Therefore, China does not allow outside powers to meddle in China&#8217;s domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Wei also urged the US to stop flexing muscles in the South China Sea, which has also been exploited by Washington as a leverage to contain China. The Hong Kong issue may extend or spill over into the South China Sea row. Wei&#8217;s words can be regarded as a warning to Washington not to take advantage of the Hong Kong issue to step up tensions in the South China Sea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>US military presence in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits is an important part of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy. China should prevent the US from roiling the South China Sea issue and Taiwan question at a time when Hong Kong&#8217;s situation continues to deteriorate.</p>
<p>US military presence poses a threat to regional peace and security, affecting stability in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and even the entire Asia-Pacific region. China is a great power in the Asia-Pacific region, and the South China Sea issue and Taiwan question concern China&#8217;s national interests and security. Beijing will not tolerate Washington&#8217;s disruptive practices in the region. If the US continues its moves, China will respond with countermeasures.</p>
<p>Chinese defense ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Monday that China and the US agreed that &#8220;the China-US military relationship is an important part of bilateral relations, and developing a healthy and stable bilateral military relationship would benefit not only China and the United States, but also regional and world peace and stability.&#8221;</p>
<p>China-US military ties would affect their diplomacies to some extent. The two countries have divergences and frictions in the domains of trade and geopolitics, but there are not many disputes in military between the two countries. The two militaries have some consensus in jointly maintaining the peace and security of East Asia, Asia-Pacific region and the whole world, creating space for their cooperation, such as jointly participating in peacekeeping and maritime escort operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Military relations play a role of stabilizer, as close China-US military relations are crucial to maintaining benign bilateral ties. As two great military powers interact, a peaceful and harmonious bilateral defense relationship will make both winners, while a confrontational one will make both losers. Their cooperation is conductive to peace and stability in East Asia, the Asia-Pacific, as well as the world.</p>

<p>A US Nobel laureate is calling for China-US cooperation on mitigating global warming, despite the US&#8217;s withdrawal from the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/958199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Agreement</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Climate change is inherently a global issue. China and the US are the two most important [countries] in terms of both causing it and being impacted by it,&#8221; William Nordhaus, Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale University and co-winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, said in a video sent to the a book launch celebrating the Chinese translation of his latest work<br />
<em>The Climate Casino</em> held at the Yale Center Beijing in early November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of solving the problem or at least taking steps to slow climate change, perhaps stop climate change, the two key countries here are the US and China, they are the countries that would need to form the core of a coalition of countries who would act together and take steps to slow climate change,&#8221; said Nordhaus.</p>
<p>From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale, according to a report issued by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013.</p>
<p>Nordhaus is one the world&#8217;s leading advisors on the economics of global warming. His insights have become one of the most widely used theoretical bases for international climate economic policies and climate change negotiations, including the Kyoto and Paris climate accords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He suggests that climate change is an urgent economic issue with impacts that bear spiraling costs. We entered the &#8220;climate casino&#8221; and are rolling the global warming dice, Nordhaus warns. But he attempts to find the keys to unlock the path to get out of the casino in his book.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Pricing of carbon</strong></span></p>
<p>Pricing of carbon and other greenhouse-gas emissions is one of the key themes in his book. Nordhaus advises that nations must establish policies that raise the price of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon pricing is essential to curb emissions, promoting low carbon technologies, and thereby inoculating the planet against the threat of unchecked warming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to put a price so that when people burn fossil fuels, and put carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the cost of that is embodied in the goods and services. If the price was higher, people would pay attention, firms would pay attention to what processes they use,&#8221; said Nordhaus.</p>
<p>But adopting a carbon tax creates another set of problems. Should carbon taxes be the same in different countries? Would the same level of carbon taxes be applicable for developing countries? If gaps are allowed, how should they be measured? These are all difficulties involving political negotiations, Liang Xiaomin, the translator of the book and a Chinese economist, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Nordhaus warns that slowing climate change requires coordinated global action. &#8220;If China and America can work together, I think they would form the core of a group which would take effective steps and form an effective policy coalition. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so delighted it has been translated into Chinese for a billion and half people, who read Chinese, speak Chinese, to talk about it, to read it, to have a chance to understand it,&#8221; Nordhaus said in the video.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Interests and conflicts</strong></span></p>
<p>Liang suggests that competing interests among various interest groups can prevent transnational cooperation in climate governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very hard to achieve a uniform set of schemes and standards at the international level. Many senior Republicans in the US, for example, are adamantly opposed to participating in global climate governance. For many of the Republican tycoons, they will suffer if carbon pricing is introduced. That&#8217;s why many environmental deals fail to be passed in the US,&#8221; Liang told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Global warming is not only a climate and economic issue, but also an international political issue,&#8221; said Liang.</p>
<p>More than 190 countries have adopted the Paris Agreement, but only the US, a major emitter of carbon dioxide and also one of the major countries that cause climate change, has rejected it.</p>
<p>International observers expect that some emerging powers, such as China and India, can show greater leadership in averting global climate change.</p>
<p>Liang believes China should do more research on climate economics. He is grateful to the Orient Publishing Center for publishing the Chinese version of Nordhaus&#8217; book, which provides lessons that can be used to promote research in China and find climate economics models applicable to China&#8217;s development.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">File photo: IC</p>
<p>The first face-to-face meeting between Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on the sidelines of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a> Defense Ministers&#8217; Meeting Plus on Monday in Bangkok is hoped to bring about positive results to cordially manage divergences while promoting defense relations. Not long ago, they spoke on a video conference, pledging to maintain stable military ties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, economic and trade relations formed the cornerstone of China-US ties. Yet after US President Donald Trump assumed office, Washington issued a series of strategic documents, including &#8220;National Security Strategy&#8221; and &#8220;National Defense Strategy,&#8221; which labeled China as a strategic competitor. It signaled that a new era of great power competition between Beijing and Washington has arrived. The US has carried out a variety of measures to contain China, such as launching the trade war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against the backdrop, military ties between the two countries have been relatively stable. During the short meeting between Wei and then acting US defense secretary Patrick Shanahan on the sidelines of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/987072.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shangri-La Dialogue</a> in Singapore on May 31, both sides agreed that the two militaries should make their relationship the stabilizer of bilateral relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, difficulties in the process should not be ignored. The biggest stumbling block in promoting China-US military ties lies in whether Washington would be willing to respect Beijing&#8217;s core interests and major security concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, the US Congress has passed a series of pro-Taiwan acts, which support US arms sales to the island and back Taiwan&#8217;s participation in international organizations. US Navy has also sent warships through the Taiwan Straits. Since 2015, US naval vessels constantly trespassed into the territorial waters of China&#8217;s Xisha and adjacent waters of Nansha Islands. After Trump took office, the frequency of such moves increased. Such acts damage military ties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not to mention the old issues that have long confounded military relations. Take DeLay Amendment, adopted in 2000 by the US Congress. It prohibits military-to-military exchanges in 12 operational areas between China and the US, because some US policymakers believe that contacts would &#8220;create a national security risk due to an inappropriate exposure.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such moves of the US are related to the growingly tough attitude toward China within US administration. An increasing number of politicians in Washington are now viewing China-US ties with a Cold War mind-set. Because of it, the US is contradicting itself. On the one hand, defense officials have been claiming to seek stable development of military relations with China, including maintaining high-level exchanges and contacts in non-traditional security fields. Yet on the other, the US defense establishment is provoking China over the latter&#8217;s core interests and major security concerns. It mirrors divergences among US policymakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet one thing is certain &#8211; maintaining stable military ties has been agreed by top officials of the two sides. Some people in the US overemphasized the competition between Beijing and Washington and expected US to pile more pressure on China. However, since both sides have the willingness to convert military ties into the stabilizer of bilateral relations, and they are continuing regular communication, stability will define ties between the two militaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, high-level visits and exchanges are going on, consultation mechanism, including Military Maritime Consultative Agreement and Asia-Pacific Security Dialogue between the defense departments of China and US are still way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both countries hope to maintain healthy and stable military ties when economic relations are leaving a lot to be desired. This will also play a positive role in stabilizing the overall relationship between China and the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">US Defense Secretary Mark Esper Photo: IC</p>
<p>US Defense Secretary Mark Esper&#8217;s second visit to Asia in just over three months justifies the Pentagon&#8217;s renewed military focus on the region with Washington&#8217;s Indo-Pacific Strategy out to contain its only proclaimed rival &#8211; China. Esper kicked off his visit to South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam from Wednesday. Asia was the destination of Esper&#8217;s first overseas trip after assuming office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Washington&#8217;s policy in the region clear, it tries to leverage its position with the help of the military.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation in the Asia-Pacific region is complicated. China-US rivalry has a strong spillover effect and many countries have begun to adjust their China and US strategies. Esper may hope to appease US allies and try to ask them to dovetail their policies to Washington&#8217;s ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems among allies need to be resolved. US President Donald Trump&#8217;s trade war is ruthless even to allies, many of whom are distancing themselves from Washington. In spite of being US treaty allies, the Philippines, Thailand and South Korea, who used to follow Washington&#8217;s lead, have been estranged with the superpower. Washington may hope to give them warnings while striving to win them over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte took office, his administration&#8217;s US policy has not been warm toward Washington and ties have cooled.</p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s relations with Seoul have not been smooth since South Korean President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1046164.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Jae-in</a> assumed office. Unlike his predecessors Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak, Moon is more prone to seeking a balanced strategy among great powers.</p>
<p>Esper utilized this trip to pressure South Korea to increase spending for US military presence there. According to Reuters, a South Korean lawmaker said US officials had demanded up to $5 billion a year, more than five times what Seoul agreed to pay this year under a one-year deal. It is another source of friction between the two countries.</p>
<p>Bangkok&#8217;s relations with Washington have been somewhat detached, while its ties with Beijing have been significantly improving. Thailand has ordered China-made submarines and tanks, and has agreed to purchase landing ships from China, signaling mutual trust in politics and security between the two countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a military ally, Washington is reluctant to see closer Beijing-Bangkok ties and would pressure Thailand to avoid moving too close to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, some &#8220;carrots&#8221; would be given to Thailand in an attempt to gain its support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, rifts remain among some US allies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, tensions between Japan and South Korea have escalated, prompting the latter to make a decision to scrap the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), which is crucial for the US to deal with<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>&#8216;s nuclear program, and monitor and guard against China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Esper is expected to coordinate relations between Tokyo and Seoul to prevent conflicts from affecting US strategic interests and urge the two countries to work together against Beijing. Esper told Moon on Friday he will try to persuade Japan to &#8220;smoothly&#8221; tackle disputes over the GSOMIA, according to South Korea&#8217;s presidential office.</p>
<p>Among Southeast Asian countries, the one that wants to counter China along with the US is Vietnam. This country&#8217;s conflicts with China stem from territorial disputes in the South China Sea and are also of historical genesis. Vietnam&#8217;s location offers the US an anchor to meddle in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Before the trip, Esper said on Twitter that he will &#8220;discuss areas of mutual concern, while seeking to strengthen defense cooperation &amp; advance regional security and stability&#8221; with these countries.</p>
<p>The &#8220;mutual concern&#8221; refers to how to cope with a rising China. In US discourse, China&#8217;s rise has been &#8220;aggressive,&#8221; &#8220;disobeying rules&#8221; and &#8220;bullying.&#8221; Washington may seek to have more military drills, arms sales to these countries, increasing its military presence in the region by engaging more in &#8220;freedom of navigation operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>US military presence in the region does play an active role in promoting its safety and security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, such as combating pirates and providing humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>However, US current military presence targets China, taking advantage of the existing regional disputes to stir up tensions by urging these small countries to confront Beijing. US warships have sailed near China&#8217;s islands in South China Sea several times. The sails have even almost led to collision between US and Chinese warships, undermining regional security and safety. If Washington continues provocations, it will all the more undermine regional security and safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After years of advances, China&#8217;s capabilities have been significantly enhanced and the gap between China and the US has narrowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump has been cranking up &#8220;America First.&#8221; Its allies have realized that if they annoy China by doing the US bidding, Washington will not come to their rescue, letting them suffer the consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, these Asian allies are distancing themselves from the US, and drawing closer to China. They will decrease their cooperation with Washington, but increase cooperation with Beijing to maintain balanced bilateral relations.</p>

<p>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong></p>
<p>China-US trade tensions have dominated headlines over the past year, sparking discussions on how to end the woes and economic bruising. While remaining optimistic, one needs to be realistic in that there isn&#8217;t a quick fix for this prolonged conflict between the world&#8217;s two largest traders. </p>
<p>Describing himself as &#8220;a big believer in China,&#8221; Hans-Paul Bürkner (<br />
<strong>Bürkner</strong>), chairman of Boston Consulting Group (BCG), urged a realistic outlook when resolving the trade conflict in an exclusive interview with Global Times reporter Li Qiaoyi (<br />
<strong>GT</strong>) in Beijing on Friday.</p>
<p>Voicing approval for an open approach China has taken to address the changing global economic landscape, Bürkner hopes for more opening-up progress in the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>GT: How effective would a phased approach be to mending the trade rift between China and the US? What are the odds that a comprehensive trade deal will be signed?</p>
<p>Bürkner:</strong> You need to find a solution. You cannot expect one big deal to solve everything. So, taking a step-by-step approach is important. The key is to talk to each other, negotiate, find the first solution, and then you keep on talking about the next issues. We should not expect the trade conflict to end over the next year or in a few months. It will take quite a while and issues will always arise, and there may be some open questions where the two sides disagree. This will go on for quite a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have experienced trade conflicts and tensions not just between China and the US, but with many countries for many years. We have this between Japan and South Korea, between Malaysia and India, and between the US and Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation between China and the US involves more conflict than the world has seen before, but eventually we&#8217;ll resolve it because this is the best way for both. China will benefit and the US will benefit too. Otherwise, everybody will lose.</p>
<p>There will be a trade deal. There will be one deal after another, and one issue after another will be resolved but it can take a lot of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GT: What is the impact of China-US trade tension on global supply chains?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bürkner:</strong> Clearly what [we have seen happen] is imports from China into the US have come down significantly, whereas the US now has more imports from Southeast Asia, Europe, and Mexico. There has been a shift. Chinese companies have also shifted some of their production to other parts of the world including Southeast Asia. Some Japanese, South Korean, and European companies have tried to avoid this. But supply changes take time to rearrange. Very few have moved production back to the US. They [will] move to other parts in Asia, and maybe Mexico. The ultimate objective of re-shoring and bringing things back to the US is not an easy goal to achieve. Companies around the world have to rethink their supply chains. But it&#8217;s not just because of the trade conflict. You have to rethink your supply chains all of the time because of changing costs. You want to be faster responding to changing customer needs; you have to be closer to home. And because of technological advances, economies of scale and scale advantages may not be as significant.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is a very complex system and you need many suppliers if you want to produce something. In order to make it work, you need to have those suppliers in one country. There is a very dense group of suppliers in China with good quality, proven systems, and replicating this in the US and anywhere else in the world is not easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GT: Is the tech world already split in two amid the trade woes? What are the implications of China-US competition within the global tech innovation arena?</p>
<p>Bürkner:</strong> First, you should not underestimate Ericsson and Nokia. There are also tech companies in Europe operating in 5G. So, it&#8217;s not just the Chinese and the Americans, but the Europeans. But of course, it could very well be [possible] if there are two tech worlds [with regard to] the internet. There are Google and Facebook from the US, as opposed to Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu from China. And there would be a clash between the two. I think ultimately, we have to overcome this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GT: What are the outlooks for other major economies such as the EU and India in the global economic landscape, and which is now shining a spotlight on China and the US?</p>
<p>Bürkner:</strong> Assuming that there is either China or the US, and there&#8217;s nobody else in the world is not quite [right]. The economy of Europe as a whole is still larger than the US and China. But the growth rate in Europe is significantly lower than the US and China, meaning eventually China and the US will overtake the entirety of Europe in economic terms.</p>
<p>India is a complex country. I think there&#8217;s potential there. But just because the population would be the largest in the world and overtake China at some stage doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the economy will become larger. It would take quite a long time, and the India model can&#8217;t just be modeled after the China model, because China was really becoming the factory of the world. India is not in that stage because the manufacturing sector in India is not that strong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, it has quite a lot of challenges, labor laws, and other things. Infrastructure has yet to be improved, but India may use the services model. It&#8217;s very strong in IT services, in order to keep on going at a good rate, but it will take quite a while before India becomes as strong an economy as China.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GT: Which areas need more work to open up China&#8217;s market to global investors?</p>
<p>Bürkner:</strong> Chinese leadership emphasized at the import and export fair in Shanghai that openness is benefiting everybody. The negative list will become shorter, there will be more opportunities for foreign investment, there will be more access for foreign companies, and I think it&#8217;s a natural process. In many countries there are limitations. It&#8217;s not just in China. The Chinese government recognizes that they have taken quite a lot of steps in the past and more needs to be done. I think this is the right path.</p>
<p><strong>GT: Digital currencies are now all the rage in the global financial sphere. Will Facebook&#8217;s Libra dominate global finance? Will the China-US trade war be extended to the cryptocurrency field?</p>
<p></strong>Bürkner: We have quite a number of cryptocurrencies, but there is a lot of speculation and even fraud. Central banks and governments will have to find ways of regulating them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the key issues is that bitcoin is used a lot on the dark net, and I think we need to be very thoughtful about how to deal with cryptocurrencies. They will not go away. They are there. I would say it&#8217;s something that we have to deal with very carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there will be a lot of tension in many areas. So, it&#8217;s not just trade and technology, it will be cryptocurrency. I&#8217;m sure these things happen. Some countries and regions push it and it is being used in some parts of the world. But normal investors should be very careful about cryptocurrency-related investing.</p>
<p><strong>GT: What changes have you learned of throughout the years, from the conversations you have had with Chinese entrepreneurs and government officials?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bürkner:</strong> First, their focus was on building China. Over the last five to 10 years, as growth in China&#8217;s market has slowed, Chinese companies have been more active in going aboard and they have also made acquisitions abroad. Some of the overseas deals proved thoughtful. As you internationalize, you have to learn. For example, when European companies went to the US, initially they had a lot of challenges and problems, and now some of them are quite successful. The same is true for Chinese companies. As they go to Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and other parts of Asia, some are successful, and some might first have problems. Business is different in many parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese are working very hard. They are willing to take risks. They work under very different conditions, but I think you also need to build a local management team. To learn what works and what doesn&#8217;t, you have to [work with] local people who understand the mentality. It&#8217;s a learning process that everybody has to go through.</p>
<p><strong>GT: In what ways has China changed the global economy?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bürkner: </strong>Whether it&#8217;s infrastructure, technology or consumer goods, I think Chinese businesses are not following in the footsteps of others. They are doing a good job. Take the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative. It&#8217;s a good thing connecting China with the rest of Asia, Africa and Europe. Two-thirds of the world&#8217;s countries are part of the Belt and Road Initiative. It will ultimately benefit countries and should not be seen as a way for China to dominate.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big believer in China. I think it&#8217;s fantastic what the Chinese have built over the last 40 years. They have really helped the world, not just China. The more we work together, the more everybody benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US has once again disparaged the Chinese economy to entertain itself. US President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed China&#8217;s supply chain was &#8220;all broken, like an egg,&#8221; and said China wanted a deal more than the US did.</p>
<p>The fact is, however, senior US officials are talking about trade wars and trade deals almost every day, while Chinese officials rarely do this. Anyone who knows a little bit about psychology can figure out that such responses of the US reflect anxiety, rather than calmness.</p>
<p>Is China&#8217;s supply chain broken like an egg? Chinese telecom giant Huawei has not begged the US to be &#8220;magnanimous.&#8221; It is now US companies that are asking to be excluded from US restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being placed in the Entity List has certainly caused difficulties for Huawei, but such hardships are far from delivering vital blows to fling the company down. Some US elites are clamoring for knocking Huawei down, but their indecent acts have only stimulated Huawei&#8217;s strength and growth. And Chinese people generally believe that this high-tech company will be increasingly strong.</p>
<p>The US cannot even defeat one Chinese enterprise by making full use of its whole country&#8217;s power. Now it is claiming it will break the supply chain of all of China as an egg. Is such bragging too exaggerated? We wonder how the public opinion and voters in the US can tolerate such a boast. The voters are seemingly quite gullible.</p>
<p>The US is suffering an economic downturn, and many indicators demonstrate that its good days are coming to an end. US state leaders and senior officials are like cheerleaders, taking turns to cheer up the stock index.</p>
<p>In terms of economic situations, Chinese officials&#8217; description is absolutely more objective and calm than the US side. China recognizes that the trade war has brought negative impacts, and our efforts to eliminate such effects are open and timely. The US, however, is trying to cover up the effects of the trade war it has launched.</p>
<p>China has already focused its efforts on solving its own problems. We will not bet on the idea that reaching a deal will fundamentally change China-US economic relations. Most Chinese believe that whether there is an agreement or not, turmoil between the two countries will not end. Chinese society is in favor of reaching a trade deal, but it is also patient.</p>
<p>Including Chinese companies such as Huawei in the Entity List will cause long-term damages to US business community&#8217;s reputation. Foreign companies may be on guard against US enterprises in the future while building their own supply chains, which will certainly offer more opportunities for US competitors.</p>
<p>The US is so keen on imposing sanctions, and is fond of applying sanctions on related third-parties. Betting on US companies may work in a short term, but cannot serve as a long-term strategy. The US has trodden business ethics under foot in this round of China-US games. It is even pleased with itself for overtly destroying China&#8217;s supply chain. At the strategic planning in the US, there are no such concepts like honesty and morality. The Chinese society has clearly observed this, as has the entire world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, China has the widest range of manufacturing sectors in the world, which has given the country a special strength in the global supply chain. China is not afraid of any game against the supply chain. Producers without China&#8217;s supply chain will certainly feel more pain than China.</p>
