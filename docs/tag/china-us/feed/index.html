<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe (left) greets US Defense Secretary Mark Esper in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday. The two held their first face-to-face talks Monday. Photo: AP</p>
<p>The Taiwan question, foreign forces meddling in Hong Kong affairs and the South China Sea row &#8211; hot-button issues towering above China-US relations &#8211; came up at the meeting between Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and US Secretary of&nbsp; Defense Mark Esper in Bangkok on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wei underscored China&#8217;s dedication to resolving the Taiwan question peacefully and demanded the US to handle the issue with caution.</p>
<p>The Taiwan question has been used by the US to contain China. As long as there are tensions between the two countries, the US will keep provoking China on the Taiwan question.</p>
<p>The riots in Hong Kong have been going on for months. Given what we currently know, this is certainly not a local issue, and there must have been foreign forces behind it. Hong Kong has been practicing the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; policy, which is now facing a challenging time. China should prevent the US from using Hong Kong to interfere in the Taiwan question, affecting China&#8217;s security and stability, and peaceful reunification. Therefore, China does not allow outside powers to meddle in China&#8217;s domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Wei also urged the US to stop flexing muscles in the South China Sea, which has also been exploited by Washington as a leverage to contain China. The Hong Kong issue may extend or spill over into the South China Sea row. Wei&#8217;s words can be regarded as a warning to Washington not to take advantage of the Hong Kong issue to step up tensions in the South China Sea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>US military presence in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits is an important part of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy. China should prevent the US from roiling the South China Sea issue and Taiwan question at a time when Hong Kong&#8217;s situation continues to deteriorate.</p>
<p>US military presence poses a threat to regional peace and security, affecting stability in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and even the entire Asia-Pacific region. China is a great power in the Asia-Pacific region, and the South China Sea issue and Taiwan question concern China&#8217;s national interests and security. Beijing will not tolerate Washington&#8217;s disruptive practices in the region. If the US continues its moves, China will respond with countermeasures.</p>
<p>Chinese defense ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said on Monday that China and the US agreed that &#8220;the China-US military relationship is an important part of bilateral relations, and developing a healthy and stable bilateral military relationship would benefit not only China and the United States, but also regional and world peace and stability.&#8221;</p>
<p>China-US military ties would affect their diplomacies to some extent. The two countries have divergences and frictions in the domains of trade and geopolitics, but there are not many disputes in military between the two countries. The two militaries have some consensus in jointly maintaining the peace and security of East Asia, Asia-Pacific region and the whole world, creating space for their cooperation, such as jointly participating in peacekeeping and maritime escort operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Military relations play a role of stabilizer, as close China-US military relations are crucial to maintaining benign bilateral ties. As two great military powers interact, a peaceful and harmonious bilateral defense relationship will make both winners, while a confrontational one will make both losers. Their cooperation is conductive to peace and stability in East Asia, the Asia-Pacific, as well as the world.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">File photo: IC</p>
<p>The first face-to-face meeting between Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on the sidelines of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a> Defense Ministers&#8217; Meeting Plus on Monday in Bangkok is hoped to bring about positive results to cordially manage divergences while promoting defense relations. Not long ago, they spoke on a video conference, pledging to maintain stable military ties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, economic and trade relations formed the cornerstone of China-US ties. Yet after US President Donald Trump assumed office, Washington issued a series of strategic documents, including &#8220;National Security Strategy&#8221; and &#8220;National Defense Strategy,&#8221; which labeled China as a strategic competitor. It signaled that a new era of great power competition between Beijing and Washington has arrived. The US has carried out a variety of measures to contain China, such as launching the trade war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against the backdrop, military ties between the two countries have been relatively stable. During the short meeting between Wei and then acting US defense secretary Patrick Shanahan on the sidelines of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/987072.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shangri-La Dialogue</a> in Singapore on May 31, both sides agreed that the two militaries should make their relationship the stabilizer of bilateral relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, difficulties in the process should not be ignored. The biggest stumbling block in promoting China-US military ties lies in whether Washington would be willing to respect Beijing&#8217;s core interests and major security concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, the US Congress has passed a series of pro-Taiwan acts, which support US arms sales to the island and back Taiwan&#8217;s participation in international organizations. US Navy has also sent warships through the Taiwan Straits. Since 2015, US naval vessels constantly trespassed into the territorial waters of China&#8217;s Xisha and adjacent waters of Nansha Islands. After Trump took office, the frequency of such moves increased. Such acts damage military ties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not to mention the old issues that have long confounded military relations. Take DeLay Amendment, adopted in 2000 by the US Congress. It prohibits military-to-military exchanges in 12 operational areas between China and the US, because some US policymakers believe that contacts would &#8220;create a national security risk due to an inappropriate exposure.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such moves of the US are related to the growingly tough attitude toward China within US administration. An increasing number of politicians in Washington are now viewing China-US ties with a Cold War mind-set. Because of it, the US is contradicting itself. On the one hand, defense officials have been claiming to seek stable development of military relations with China, including maintaining high-level exchanges and contacts in non-traditional security fields. Yet on the other, the US defense establishment is provoking China over the latter&#8217;s core interests and major security concerns. It mirrors divergences among US policymakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet one thing is certain &#8211; maintaining stable military ties has been agreed by top officials of the two sides. Some people in the US overemphasized the competition between Beijing and Washington and expected US to pile more pressure on China. However, since both sides have the willingness to convert military ties into the stabilizer of bilateral relations, and they are continuing regular communication, stability will define ties between the two militaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, high-level visits and exchanges are going on, consultation mechanism, including Military Maritime Consultative Agreement and Asia-Pacific Security Dialogue between the defense departments of China and US are still way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both countries hope to maintain healthy and stable military ties when economic relations are leaving a lot to be desired. This will also play a positive role in stabilizing the overall relationship between China and the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Mark Esper&#8217;s second visit to Asia in just over three months justifies the Pentagon&#8217;s renewed military focus on the region with Washington&#8217;s Indo-Pacific Strategy out to contain its only proclaimed rival &#8211; China. Esper kicked off his visit to South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam from Wednesday. Asia was the destination of Esper&#8217;s first overseas trip after assuming office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Washington&#8217;s policy in the region clear, it tries to leverage its position with the help of the military.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation in the Asia-Pacific region is complicated. China-US rivalry has a strong spillover effect and many countries have begun to adjust their China and US strategies. Esper may hope to appease US allies and try to ask them to dovetail their policies to Washington&#8217;s ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problems among allies need to be resolved. US President Donald Trump&#8217;s trade war is ruthless even to allies, many of whom are distancing themselves from Washington. In spite of being US treaty allies, the Philippines, Thailand and South Korea, who used to follow Washington&#8217;s lead, have been estranged with the superpower. Washington may hope to give them warnings while striving to win them over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte took office, his administration&#8217;s US policy has not been warm toward Washington and ties have cooled.</p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s relations with Seoul have not been smooth since South Korean President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1046164.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Jae-in</a> assumed office. Unlike his predecessors Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak, Moon is more prone to seeking a balanced strategy among great powers.</p>
<p>Esper utilized this trip to pressure South Korea to increase spending for US military presence there. According to Reuters, a South Korean lawmaker said US officials had demanded up to $5 billion a year, more than five times what Seoul agreed to pay this year under a one-year deal. It is another source of friction between the two countries.</p>
<p>Bangkok&#8217;s relations with Washington have been somewhat detached, while its ties with Beijing have been significantly improving. Thailand has ordered China-made submarines and tanks, and has agreed to purchase landing ships from China, signaling mutual trust in politics and security between the two countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a military ally, Washington is reluctant to see closer Beijing-Bangkok ties and would pressure Thailand to avoid moving too close to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, some &#8220;carrots&#8221; would be given to Thailand in an attempt to gain its support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, rifts remain among some US allies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, tensions between Japan and South Korea have escalated, prompting the latter to make a decision to scrap the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), which is crucial for the US to deal with<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a>&#8216;s nuclear program, and monitor and guard against China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Esper is expected to coordinate relations between Tokyo and Seoul to prevent conflicts from affecting US strategic interests and urge the two countries to work together against Beijing. Esper told Moon on Friday he will try to persuade Japan to &#8220;smoothly&#8221; tackle disputes over the GSOMIA, according to South Korea&#8217;s presidential office.</p>
<p>Among Southeast Asian countries, the one that wants to counter China along with the US is Vietnam. This country&#8217;s conflicts with China stem from territorial disputes in the South China Sea and are also of historical genesis. Vietnam&#8217;s location offers the US an anchor to meddle in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Before the trip, Esper said on Twitter that he will &#8220;discuss areas of mutual concern, while seeking to strengthen defense cooperation &amp; advance regional security and stability&#8221; with these countries.</p>
<p>The &#8220;mutual concern&#8221; refers to how to cope with a rising China. In US discourse, China&#8217;s rise has been &#8220;aggressive,&#8221; &#8220;disobeying rules&#8221; and &#8220;bullying.&#8221; Washington may seek to have more military drills, arms sales to these countries, increasing its military presence in the region by engaging more in &#8220;freedom of navigation operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>US military presence in the region does play an active role in promoting its safety and security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, such as combating pirates and providing humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>However, US current military presence targets China, taking advantage of the existing regional disputes to stir up tensions by urging these small countries to confront Beijing. US warships have sailed near China&#8217;s islands in South China Sea several times. The sails have even almost led to collision between US and Chinese warships, undermining regional security and safety. If Washington continues provocations, it will all the more undermine regional security and safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After years of advances, China&#8217;s capabilities have been significantly enhanced and the gap between China and the US has narrowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump has been cranking up &#8220;America First.&#8221; Its allies have realized that if they annoy China by doing the US bidding, Washington will not come to their rescue, letting them suffer the consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, these Asian allies are distancing themselves from the US, and drawing closer to China. They will decrease their cooperation with Washington, but increase cooperation with Beijing to maintain balanced bilateral relations.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: GT</p>
<p>The US has once again disparaged the Chinese economy to entertain itself. US President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed China&#8217;s supply chain was &#8220;all broken, like an egg,&#8221; and said China wanted a deal more than the US did.</p>
<p>The fact is, however, senior US officials are talking about trade wars and trade deals almost every day, while Chinese officials rarely do this. Anyone who knows a little bit about psychology can figure out that such responses of the US reflect anxiety, rather than calmness.</p>
<p>Is China&#8217;s supply chain broken like an egg? Chinese telecom giant Huawei has not begged the US to be &#8220;magnanimous.&#8221; It is now US companies that are asking to be excluded from US restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being placed in the Entity List has certainly caused difficulties for Huawei, but such hardships are far from delivering vital blows to fling the company down. Some US elites are clamoring for knocking Huawei down, but their indecent acts have only stimulated Huawei&#8217;s strength and growth. And Chinese people generally believe that this high-tech company will be increasingly strong.</p>
<p>The US cannot even defeat one Chinese enterprise by making full use of its whole country&#8217;s power. Now it is claiming it will break the supply chain of all of China as an egg. Is such bragging too exaggerated? We wonder how the public opinion and voters in the US can tolerate such a boast. The voters are seemingly quite gullible.</p>
<p>The US is suffering an economic downturn, and many indicators demonstrate that its good days are coming to an end. US state leaders and senior officials are like cheerleaders, taking turns to cheer up the stock index.</p>
<p>In terms of economic situations, Chinese officials&#8217; description is absolutely more objective and calm than the US side. China recognizes that the trade war has brought negative impacts, and our efforts to eliminate such effects are open and timely. The US, however, is trying to cover up the effects of the trade war it has launched.</p>
<p>China has already focused its efforts on solving its own problems. We will not bet on the idea that reaching a deal will fundamentally change China-US economic relations. Most Chinese believe that whether there is an agreement or not, turmoil between the two countries will not end. Chinese society is in favor of reaching a trade deal, but it is also patient.</p>
<p>Including Chinese companies such as Huawei in the Entity List will cause long-term damages to US business community&#8217;s reputation. Foreign companies may be on guard against US enterprises in the future while building their own supply chains, which will certainly offer more opportunities for US competitors.</p>
<p>The US is so keen on imposing sanctions, and is fond of applying sanctions on related third-parties. Betting on US companies may work in a short term, but cannot serve as a long-term strategy. The US has trodden business ethics under foot in this round of China-US games. It is even pleased with itself for overtly destroying China&#8217;s supply chain. At the strategic planning in the US, there are no such concepts like honesty and morality. The Chinese society has clearly observed this, as has the entire world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, China has the widest range of manufacturing sectors in the world, which has given the country a special strength in the global supply chain. China is not afraid of any game against the supply chain. Producers without China&#8217;s supply chain will certainly feel more pain than China.</p>
