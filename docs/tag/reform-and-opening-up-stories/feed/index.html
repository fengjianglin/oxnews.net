<p>Lu Qun is regarded by many on China&#8217;s social media as an &#8220;anti-corruption hero.&#8221; </p>
<p>In his verified Sina Weibo account, China&#8217;s equivalent of Twitter, Lu, as an anti-graft official, dared to accuse the country&#8217;s top-level officials of bribe-taking and he exposed corruption to the public. His outspoken manner has garnered him more than 230,000 followers.</p>
<p>Despite the praises netizens have given to him, Lu said that he doesn&#8217;t regard himself as the &#8220;anti-corruption fighter&#8221; that some netizens think he is. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just an experienced discipline inspection and supervision official who dares to speak the truth and expose corruption issues,&#8221; he told the Global Times modestly.</p>
<p>Lu, 47, a veteran anti-graft official, has worked in this field for 22 years. </p>
<p>His highest position is the deputy director of the Corruption Prevention Office at the Hunan Provincial Disciplinary Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC), a Party organ that serves the country&#8217;s anti-corruption drive, in Central China&#8217;s Hunan Province. </p>
<p>He left the position two years ago and became the secretary of the commission for discipline inspection at a local State-owned financial company in Changsha, capital of Hunan. </p>
<p>One of the most striking moves in his career took place in 2014 when he accused the former head of China&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) of corruption through Weibo. </p>
<p>He criticized the CFDA for reclassifying the southern-grown honeysuckle flower, a traditional Chinese medicine herb, as another type of herb which has lower medical value. </p>
<p>The reclassification drove down the price sharply and strained the finances of many farmers in southern China. </p>
<p>Lu claimed that the top official took bribes and did this on purpose to benefit the growers in East China&#8217;s Shandong Province where the former CFDA head hails from. Lu said publicly back then that he was willing to sacrifice his government position to investigate the case. </p>
<p>The event aroused nationwide ­attention and heated discussion. But the CFDA&#8217;s internal investigation result wasn&#8217;t what Lu had expected. </p>
<p>Without any internal and external pressure, Lu still chose to leave his post in 2016, and then assumed a new position in local State-owned company.</p>
<p>Hailing from a rural family, Lu said that he still wanted to do more tangible work for vulnerable rural. </p>
<p>As an old hand, Lu stressed that any ruling party that doesn&#8217;t speak strongly against corruption will lose public support and undermine its foundation. </p>
<p>&#8220;In this sense, our Party has a sober understanding of corruption and anti-­corruption,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>According to Lu, anti-corruption work has made remarkable progress since the 18th CPC National Congress held in 2012. </p>
<p>He said that since the Party congress, the overall strategy has shifted to focusing on treating the symptoms first to win time for stemming corruption at the source. The Party takes a zero-tolerance and unrestricted-area approach to fighting corruption­. </p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of new methods, we improve the Party style of work and crack down on both &#8216;tigers&#8217; and &#8216;flies,'&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>He praised the new inspection policy in which the higher Party institutions inspected the lower ones to find traces of corruption. &#8220;This effectively supplements the traditional method that purely depended on the reports of ordinary people,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>The Xinhua News Agency reported that more than 1.5 million corrupt officials have been punished and a total number of 440 centrally administrative senior officials have been investigated by the disciplinary arm of the CPC since November 2012.</p>
<p>In Lu&#8217;s opinion, the stricter Party discipline enforced after the 18th CPC National Congress is meaningful. </p>
<p>&#8220;Adhering to the principle that the Party discipline should be stricter than the law is an essential lesson in strengthening Party self-discipline,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In 2016, the CPC Central Committee institutionalized the experiences from the four years&#8217; anti-graft campaign and unveiled two stricter-than-ever sets of internal discipline measures. They are applied to both officials and ordinary members of the Party.</p>
<p>Xinhua reported that a public poll showed that Chinese people&#8217;s satisfaction with anti-corruption efforts rose from 75 percent in 2012 to 94 percent by 2017. </p>
