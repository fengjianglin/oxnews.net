<p>A DC Comics poster showing Batman holding a petrol bomb has triggered heated debate online for its seemingly implicit support of Hong Kong&#8217;s rioters.</p>
<p>While the company deleted the poster from its Instagram account on Thursday, doubts and questions persist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that DC could make such a mistake, as the company will likely not be able to deal with the serious consequences of being involved in such a political issue and in a country&#8217;s internal affairs.</p>
<p>DC should immediately clarify the situation, or it will risk losing the Chinese market to its rival Marvel.</p>

  <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-11-27/55f3b01b-016e-41e9-82a6-c7427aba67af.jpeg"><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Lau Siu-kai, the vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, is interviewed by the Global Times on Wednesday. </p>
<p>After pan-democratic groups scored a big win in the district council elections on Sunday, a leading adviser of Beijing&#8217;s top think tank on Hong Kong affairs predicted that the political battle would further intensify in the city. The opposition may gain 40 percent of seats at the Election Committee, but they won&#8217;t be able to decide who will be the chief executive as the majority is still in the hands of the pro-establishment camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest district council election took place amid social unrest, which hardly delivered a clear message. After the opposition groups won by a landslide, they will use district councils as their base for continuing political battle, turning the district council, usually place to address issues related to people&#8217;s livelihood, to a highly politicized place to exert influence on public opinion and create pressure on authorities, Lau Siu-kai, the vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times in an interview on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pan-democratic groups won 388 out of 452 seats in Sunday&#8217;s elections, controlling the majority of the district councils, while Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong gained only 59 seats, a result significantly different from last elections when the latter controlled the majority of seats years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Although opposition camp won the victory, about 40 percent voted for pro-establishment camp, showing that the fundamental base of supporters for the camp has not changed,&#8221; Lau said.</p>
<p>The voting results show there has been no significant gap between pan-democratic camp and the pro-establishment party, as the latter took about 45 percent of total votes, and the opposition force took around 60 percent. Considering the system of a &#8220;single-seat, single-vote&#8221; electoral system, the opposition force could gain a majority of the seats, Lau said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fundamental support base for the pro-establishment party has not changed, and some candidates even gained votes compared to the previous elections,&#8221; he noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The turnout at this year&#8217;s elections surpassed 70 percent, the highest in history, and many newly registered voters are youngsters who have been voicing opposition toward the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region&nbsp; government during months of anti-government protests, which have escalated into violence.</p>
<p>In the past, the voter turnout for district council elections was relatively low, as not many people were interested in electing members who deal with social and livelihood issues. &#8220;However, it has been becoming more politicized, about political agenda and political parties,&#8221; Lau said, noting that although it&#8217;s abnormal, the district council still remains an advisory body that exerts a certain influence on policymakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no clear boundaries as to what role district council could play, which gives room for council members to bring up political topics and agenda, further influencing public opinion, Lau noted.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor also admitted that this year&#8217;s election was a particular one, which has a more political dimension to it amid unstable and violent environment and chaotic situation. And newly elected district council members are expected to shoulder their responsibilities as the councils, as advisory body, are an important part of Hong Kong&#8217;s political life. </p>
<p>&#8220;Scoring a big win at the district council election won&#8217;t guarantee pan-democratic groups could seek further influence on government&#8217;s policies, or take control of the authority,&#8221; Lau said, noting that the final say is still in the hands of the SAR government over policy implementation. As long as pro-establishment members are united, opposition forces won&#8217;t have any chance,&#8221; he said</p>
<p>While some raised questions about why the majority of Hong Kong people votes for opposition groups, reflecting an anti-Beijing public opinion, Lau claimed that such claim has been exaggerated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been unnecessary worry among some Hong Kong people, as they think the central government will take measures to weaken Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy, and such misunderstanding has been deepened amid widespread anti-government mood,&#8221; the senior advisor said. </p>
<p>When Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping proposed the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle, he never asked Hong Kong people to love the Communist Party of China, Lau noted. &#8220;Hong Kong could always maintain its original system, lifestyle and values, including its recognition of Western values,&#8221; he said, adding that as such, Hong Kong people would be assured and the city could continue playing its unique role of connecting China with the West.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">&nbsp;Photo: VCG</p>
<p><strong>Reflection needed&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The pro-establishment group and HKSAR government said they would seriously reflect on a general mood that is unsatisfied with the way the authority governs, which resulted in the election results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Lau, the senior adviser to both HKSAR government and the central government, said defeat in the elections would enhance crisis awareness, helping to enhance solidarity among Beijing, HKSAR government and the pro-establishment camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s widely believed that the ultimate goal of pan-democratic camp is not to win the majority at the district council, but to win at next year&#8217;s Legislative Council elections, which will pave the way for them to grab more seats at Election Committee for selecting the next chief executive in coming years, observers said. </p>
<p>&#8220;Although it has not shaken Hong Kong&#8217;s fundamental political landscape so far, the HKSAR government is urged to cooperate with the pro-establishment camp and to change its stance of governing without taking others&#8217; suggestions into account,&#8221; Lau said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While pro-democrats&#8217; control of district council may further exert influence on election commission for selecting the chief executive, Beijing is expected to reconsider its policies concerning Hong Kong affairs.</p>

<p><strong>Further measures</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government should come up with preventive measures as Beijing would never tolerate an opposition force posing a threat to national sovereignty, Lau said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western media and politicians praised the district council elections as &#8220;de facto referendum on Hong Kong democracy,&#8221; but Lau said the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; is still the best arrangement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The central government will continue using its power to safeguard &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217;, particularly to come up with measures to crack down on secessionists,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>Opposition groups in Hong Kong, echoing values and expectation of Western countries, may continue confronting the central government, when the West continues to smear the Chinese model of development as populism rises in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;But they need to understand that keeping political position in line with national interests is the only way to maintain &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; principle that ensures the future of Hong Kong,&#8221; Lau said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Hong Kong High Court ruling on the anti-mask law was not in line with the Basic Law, posing a blatant challenge to the authority of the Standing Committee of National People&#8217;s Congress and the chief executive of HKSAR, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress expressed deep concerns over the ruling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such an attitude shows that the central government increasingly considers Hong Kong affairs from a national security perspective, as external forces challenge&nbsp; national sovereignty and seek to seize control of governance,&#8221; Lau said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the current situation, the central government would probably clarify the power of the central government on Hong Kong issues. &#8220;And the interpretation of the Basic Law would become more normalized, to make sure that the &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; principle is carried out in an accurate and comprehensive way,&#8221; Lau added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eleven new universities on the Chinese mainland will open their doors to Hong Kong students, expanding the number of colleges to 122 including Tsinghua and Peking universities, in a move that Chinese analysts believed will strengthen mutual understanding.</p>
<p>The education bureau of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on Wednesday announced on its official website that Hong Kong students can apply to mainland universities from March 1 to 20 for next academic year by taking the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mainland&#8217;s admission program for Hong Kong high school students started in 2012. Eleven universities were added this year, including the University of Science and Technology of China, Huazhong University of Science And Technology and Beijing Film Academy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The list grew to 122 universities under 21 provincial-level administrative regions, according to China&#8217;s <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/4.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Education</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bureau will have further discussions with relevant departments in the mainland to get more mainland universities involved in the scheme, providing choices for study and opportunities to connect with the mainland&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>Hong Kong students will be admitted based on their performance in the examination and are exempt from the joint college entrance examination for mainland universities. That would reduce the pressure on the students, according to the Hong Kong education bureau.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chu Zhaohui, a research fellow at the Beijing-based National Institute of Education Sciences, hailed the move as helping Hong Kong youth increase their knowledge of the mainland and build friendship with their mainland peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unrest in Hong Kong has discouraged many mainland students from applying to universities in Hong Kong, Chu said. Maintaining mutual exchanges and ties Is important amid recent situations, he noted.</p>
<p>The mainland side has been encouraging Hong Kong students to study on the mainland. In 2017, the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/13.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Finance</a> released a document stipulating that undergraduate students from Hong Kong and Macao who study on the mainland could receive a scholarship up to 8,000 yuan ($1138.2) a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program simplified procedures for Hong Kong students to be enrolled at mainland universities, but Chu noted that no extra privilege should be granted to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo social media, mainland internet users welcomed their Hong Kong compatriots. Some suggested the schools add history and general knowledge exams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong&#8217;s unrest shows some Hong Kong students lack basic knowledge of the colonial past and love for the country,&#8221; posted a net user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they could have more understanding of our shared history and culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some 1,556 Hong Kong students enrolled at mainland universities in 2018 and 3,511 applied in 2019, the Xinhua News Agency reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many celebrities from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have called on local residents to vote rationally in the district council election to say no to violence and restore social order.</p>
<p>A total of 46 celebrities including Jackie Chan, Joey Yung and Jordan Chan Siu Chun, shot short videos and edited them into a one-minute clip, speaking of their hopes of &#8220;rebuilding, safeguarding Hong Kong&#8221; and opposing violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They asked voters to fulfill their responsibilities and use their rights to bring a better future for the city.</p>
<p>Jackie Chan was the first to appear in the video, saying, &#8220;Hong Kong is our home and its development depends on all of us.&#8221; He spoke in Cantonese calling on Hongkongers to vote rationally.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Hong Kong celebrities have publicly fought against violence. Jackie Chan, pop singer Jackson Wang Ka-Yee and actor William Chan, as well as other Hong Kong celebrities, promised to protect the Chinese national flag on Sina Weibo after several masked rioters threw the flag at the Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Pier into the sea on August 4.</p>
<p>Cecilia Cheung Pak-chi, a well-known actress in Hong Kong, posted a photo both on Sina Weibo and Instagram on November 15, calling for an end to violence and restoring of social order. The post came after Chinese top leader said at the 11th BRICS summit on November 14 that stopping violence and restoring order is the most pressing task for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The district council election, held every four years and allowing residents to vote from 7:30 am to 10:30 pm, started on Sunday amid escalating violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starry Lee Wai-king, chairman of Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said that more than 80 of the party&#8217;s agencies suffered over 100 instances of damage, and candidates were attacked almost every time when they attended campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong lawmaker Junius Ho was attacked by a knife-wielding man on November 6 at Tuen Men during his campaign.</p>

<p>A total of 12,000 police officers in Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province participated in a drill on Tuesday, attracting online attention as the drill features emergency scenarios that resemble the ongoing riots in adjacent Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shenzhen police said that the drill aimed to maintain social stability, encourage the morale of police forces, and prepare the forces ahead of 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, according to a statement sent by the police to the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Participants included all police forces &#8211; land, air and sea &#8211; and equipment such as armored cars, helicopters and amphibious vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-08-06/88dd71dc-5cf6-4985-b5ea-c48c41b8255d.jpeg"><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Screenshot of the drill of Shenzhen police. Photo: Courtesy of Shenzhen police</p>
<p>However, the drill attracted unusual attention on social media as many netizens, who hold a grudge against recent riots in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said the drill can also call the attention of rioters in Hong Kong, and give Hong Kong police a tip about how to deal with radical protesters.</p>
<p>According to video clips of the drill, people in the crowd simulating a mob wore helmets, masks and black outfits. They constantly threw objects at the shield-holding police forces, and attacked them with wooden sticks.</p>
<p>To deal with such violence, the police fired tear gas and sent police dogs. They used a newly developed cluster tear gas, which has wider coverage and stronger effect compared with traditional ones.</p>
<p>The crowd also pushed blazing carts toward police, who immediately put out the fire with fire extinguishers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drill was live broadcasted via many online media platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crowds&#8217; outfits, equipment and the manner in which they attacked the police were very similar to those of the radical protesters in Hong Kong, which prompted many netizens to link&nbsp;the drill&nbsp;with the riots in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Many suggested that this could send a signal to those rioters, and called on Hong Kong police to learn from the drill.&nbsp;</p>
