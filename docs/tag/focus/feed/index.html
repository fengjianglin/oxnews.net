<p>President Xi Jinping on Monday met with Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam, who is in Shanghai for the second China International Import Expo.</p>
<p>After hearing Lam&#8217;s report on the recent situation in Hong Kong, Xi said the disturbances in Hong Kong have lasted five months. Lam has led the SAR government to fully discharge its duties, strive to stabilize the situation and improve the social atmosphere, and has done a lot of hard work, he said.</p>
<p>Xi voiced the central government&#8217;s high degree of trust in Lam and full acknowledgement of the work of her and her governance team.</p>
<p>Ending violence and chaos and restoring order remain the most important task for Hong Kong at present, he noted.</p>

<p>Xi demanded unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities in accordance with the law to safeguard the well-being of the general public in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, effective efforts should be made in work including having dialogue with all sectors of the society and improving people&#8217;s livelihood, Xi said.</p>
<p>Xi expressed his hope that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong fully and faithfully implement the principle of &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; and the HKSAR Basic Law, and make concerted efforts to safeguard Hong Kong&#8217;s prosperity and stability.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Chief Justice Zhou Qiang delivers a work report of the Supreme People&#8217;s Court (SPC) at the third plenary meeting of the second session of the 13th National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Tuesday. Photo:Xinhua</p>
<p>Ranging from graft, local mafia, sexual assault, to copyright infringement, China&#8217;s top court and procuratorate authorities said Tuesday that they have imposed high pressure on law violations, corrected wrongful convictions and safeguarded the good Samaritan spirit, showing that the country&#8217;s judicial system is playing a bigger role in ensuring social stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delivering their work reports Tuesday morning at the ongoing annual national legislative session, Chief Justice Zhou Qiang and Procurator-General Zhang Jun highlighted their progress in the past year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reports quickly made a splash on Chinese social media platforms and triggered Chinese netizens&#8217; heated discussions as they conveyed legal spirits in examples by listing a series of typical and controversial judicial cases last year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the reports also manifested a more open and intelligent Chinese judicial system such as the smart court, which uses big data to provide legal services for the public and the cloud system that helps judges find files of similar cases efficiently</p>
<p>Chinese legal experts hailed the huge progress in judicial reform as being more based on people&#8217;s increasing demand for democracy, rule of law, fairness and justice, security and a better environment.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Supreme People&#8217;s Court (SPC) handled 34,794 cases in 2018 and concluded 31,883 cases, up 22.1 percent and 23.5 percent year on year respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local courts saw an increase of 8.8 percent and 10.6 percent in the cases they handled and concluded, said the SPC&nbsp;report. </p>
<p>With unwavering resolve to bring corruption to justice, Chinese courts concluded 28,000 graft cases involving embezzlement, bribery and dereliction of duty last year. Of the 33,000 people involved, 18 were former officials at the provincial level or above. Meanwhile, 32 such former high-ranking officials, including Sun Zhengcai and Wang Sanyun, were charged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sun is the former Party chief of Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing Municipality, who was sentenced to life in prison in May 2018 for taking bribes of over 170 million yuan ($25.29 million), while Wang, former Party chief of Gansu Province, stood trial in October 2018, accused of using his position for taking bribes.</p>
<p><strong>Justice for the people</strong></p>
<p>Making headway in the campaign to combat organized crime and root out local mafia, the reports also revealed that Chinese courts concluded 5,489 related cases in 2018 which involved 29,000 criminals, while procuratorates across the country approved the arrest of 73,385 suspects involved in such crimes, among whom 61,188 were indicted.</p>
<p>Li Shenglong, deputy judge at the No.1 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court of Chongqing, who is also a political advisor, told media after the session that the reports, based on facts and data, fully showcased the Chinese judiciary&#8217;s efforts in safeguarding social justice and fairness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Chinese social media platforms, many users said that they were impressed by the judiciary&#8217;s move to rectify wrongful convictions and solve problems that incurred strong public dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>For example, the local procuratorate did not prosecute Zhao Yu, who was detained for intentional assault injury, after stopping an attempted rape of his female neighbor.</p>
<p>Zhao posted on his Sina Weibo Tuesday that &#8220;I appreciated the acknowledgement from the Supreme People&#8217;s Procuratorate and hope that the report could encourage more people to be a Good Samaritan without any worries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Qin Qianhong, a constitutional law professor at Wuhan University, told the Global Times that the reports conveyed a strong message to the outside world that China&#8217;s judiciary aims to fully protect people&#8217;s rights and needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cases like the Peppa Pig copyright infringement case and the private enterprise Kechley case, proved that message, Qin said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August 2018, the Hangzhou Internet Court adjudicated a copyright infringement case and ordered two offending Chinese companies to compensate the copyright owners of British animation Peppa Pig.</p>
<p>A 12-year dispute between Yulin Kechley Energy Investment Company and the Xi&#8217;an Geology and Mineral Exploration and Development Institute under Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources over mining rights worth 100 billion yuan was finally adjudicated by the SPC in favor of Kechley, Qin said, a landmark case of the central government ruling the country by law and protecting the property rights of private enterprises.</p>
<p>Cases relevant to intellectual property rights (IPR) were also highlighted in the SPC report. Chinese courts at all levels concluded 288,000 IPR cases of first instance in 2018, up 41.8 percent year on year.</p>
<p>A tribunal for IPR-related cases was set up at the Supreme People&#8217;s Court last year to further strengthen judicial protection of IPR.</p>
<p>Protecting IPR means creating a better environment for the international exchange of business activities and also to help guarantee innovation by domestic entrepreneurs, Wang Wanqiong, a lawyer from the Chongqing Exceedon&amp; Partners Law Firm, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Protecting personal safety and property security rights of entrepreneurs, especially those from the private sector, will also be highlighted in the future, Wang noted.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges ahead</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme People&#8217;s Court and the Supreme People&#8217;s Procuratorate will continue to provide legal guarantees for sustained and sound economic and social development and strengthen their team building, according to their reports.</p>
<p>Fostering a favorable business environment by improving the rule of law and offering better legal services will be a priority in 2019 to promote the country&#8217;s high-quality development, said the judicial bodies&#8217; reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having noted the decline in warrants, Qin said that prosecutors should have a clearer mind about their jobs and supervision responsibilities as the country has established a special supervision committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qin also urged courts to continue fighting judicial corruption and promote judicial transparency. &#8220;Publicizing more judicial documents may be one of the most important steps,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An increasing number of judicial documents are uploaded online and more cases are broadcast live via the website of China&#8217;s judicial bodies, Wang noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was &#8220;vivid evidence of China&#8217;s efforts to promote judicial transparency,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Although legal awareness has improved remarkably among Chinese people, many still exhibit limited knowledge of how to use the most appropriate legal means when disputes occur, Wang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, the overuse of litigation in civil and commercial cases has brought huge pressure to China&#8217;s judicial system, while non-litigation approaches, such as mediation and arbitration, are still strange to many, Wang said.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Children at the Xiajiang County Kindergarten in East China&#8217;s Jiangxi Province water a tree in a park on Monday.

<p>In the face of an economic slowdown and employment pressure, China has reaffirmed its determination to win the tough battle against pollution and pledged that boosting the economy will not come at the price of a degraded environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at a press conference on the sidelines of the annual legislative session on Monday, China&#8217;s Ecology and Environment Minister Li Ganjie vowed to coordinate efforts of environmental protection and economic development in 2019, an important year for winning the battle.</p>
<p>Li claimed that China has made progress in addressing the prominent problems on environmental protection, especially along the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and promised the public that the monitoring data are accurate and authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, he also admitted that the battle remains an arduous task and the road quite long as local ental protection authorities were found to have a &#8220;wavering mind,&#8221; with huge gaps between cities and regions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese analysts said that although previous simple and rough practices in dealing with environmental problems have led to the shutdown of factories and a decline in local fiscal revenue, in the long run, the battle against pollution will bring a new economic growth point and help China switch from high-speed to high-quality growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No crossing red line</strong></p>
<p>In 2018, the proportion of blue-sky days in 338 cities at or above the prefectural level increased by 1.3 percentage points to 79.3 percent, with PM 2.5 concentrations dropping 9.3 percent year-on-year, Li said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to fight smog, China has expanded its coal-to-gas and coal-to-electricity projects to 35 cities in 2018 from 12 cities the previous year, Li noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for protecting the Yangtze River, which was described by President Xi Jinping as &#8220;seriously ill&#8221; at a symposium last year in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Li&nbsp; said 99.9 percent of the 1,474 drinking water sources in cities above county-level along the Yangtze River Economic Belt, stringing up 11 provinces and municipalities from west to east, have had their problems resolved.</p>
<p>Li added that over 90 percent of the 12 &#8220;black and malodorous water bodies&#8221; in provincial capital cities have been cleaned up, while prefecture-level cities are catching up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li also reiterated what Xi had said when he attended a panel discussion with deputies to the National People&#8217;s Congress from Inner Mongolia on March 5: Local governments should not pursue economic growth at the cost of the environment when economic development encounters difficulties. Li marked it as a key guide for the future battle against pollution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the panel discussion, Xi stressed efforts to maintain strategic resolve in enhancing the building of an ecological civilization and to protect the country&#8217;s beautiful scenery in the northern border areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He warned local governments against launching new projects to boost economic growth by sacrificing the environment when its economic growth encounters difficulties, and not to even consider trying to cross the ecological red line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xi underlined a resolute and effective fight to prevent and control pollution, saying prominent environmental issues the people are strongly concerned about must be addressed properly.</p>
<p>Some polluted factory owners in China reached by the Global Times said they previously regarded inspectors&#8217; visits as something like &#8220;loud thunder, little rain.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the wake of the downward pressure on the economy, some have speculated that China might back down on its tough battle against pollution to support economic growth.</p>
<p>However, they have begun to feel a harder line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The impact on companies is very big,&#8221; a business owner in the manufacturing hub of Yiwu, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province told the Global Times, noting that many small manufacturing firms in Yiwu had either been shut down or fined severely.</p>
<p>Concern began to surface on the internet that China&#8217;s push to environmental protection could affect economic performance. Downward pressure on the Chinese economy has also worried global investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Chinese experts, lawmakers and political advisers attending the annual two sessions are optimistic about the economic outlook.</p>
<p><strong>New growth point</strong></p>
<p>There has been a misunderstanding that green development will restrain economic growth. In fact, environmental protection itself can be a very promising field for investment, Xu Hongcai, assistant minister at the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/13.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Finance</a>, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The governments have discarded their previous simple approach and are trying to find a balance between fighting pollution and stabilizing growth, Xu said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, instead of shutting factories down, local governments are supporting companies which upgrade facilities, increasing investment to them and helping laid-off employees find new jobs, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The green industry is also a new economic growth point. Some companies which invested in pollution treatment facilities now experience record high profits, Xu said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city of Hengshui in North China&#8217;s Hebei Province is one example. The Hengshui government provides environment management guidance to help enterprises achieve green development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the environment protection upgrade, Hengshui Baili Rubber Products Co. bid farewell to its previously disheveled factory area, meeting the requirements of the European market, media reports said. </p>
<p><strong>Livelihood matters</strong></p>
<p>Officials also attached great importance to issues related to their people&#8217;s livelihood, including clean air and water, safe food and medicine.</p>
<p>At an earlier press briefing, top market regulators also vowed to step up regulation in food and medicine this year, particularly for vaccines, after recent incidents involving defective vaccines for children, which sparked nationwide outrage and concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vaccines affect everyone&#8217;s health. They affect public health security and national security,&#8221; Jiao Hong, director of the National Medical Products Administration, told the briefing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said regulators are creating a long-term regulatory system and are pushing forward rules to ensure vaccine safety.&nbsp;</p>
