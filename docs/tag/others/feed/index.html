<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Tesla vehicles sit parked outside of a showroom in Brooklyn in New York. File photo: VCG</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Wednesday cited driver errors and Tesla Inc&#8217;s Autopilot design as the probable causes of a Model S crash in January 2018. The car, which was operating in Autopilot mode, crashed into a parked fire truck on a highway in California early last year.</p>
<p>The safety board, which previously criticized Tesla&#8217;s driver-assistance system Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, said that the system&#8217;s design &#8220;permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task&#8221; in the Culver City, California, crash. The NTSB said on Tuesday that Autopilot allowed the driver to keep his hands off the wheel for the vast majority of the nearly 14 minutes of the trip.</p>
<p>The fire truck was unoccupied and the driver was not injured in the incident. The NTSB cited the driver&#8217;s &#8220;inattention and overreliance&#8221; on the advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal US crashes, including one involving a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida, and a crash in Mountain View, California, of a Model X. Both incidents, which occurred in March 2018, remain under investigation by the NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The NTSB is responsible for making safety recommendations, while the NHTSA can order a recall if it deems a defect poses an unreasonable risk to safety.</p>
<p>The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer-watchdog group, said on Wednesday that the NTSB report should prompt NHTSA to &#8220;do its job and recall these vehicles &#8230; A vehicle that enables a driver to not pay attention, or fall asleep, while accelerating into a parked fire truck is defective and dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla said in an emailed statement that since the 2018 crash, &#8220;We have made updates to our system including adjusting the time intervals between hands-on warnings and the conditions under which they&#8217;re activated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company added that Tesla owners have driven billions of miles with Autopilot engaged, and that its data &#8220;indicates that drivers using Autopilot remain safer than those operating without assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system&#8217;s ability to detect hazards, and sparked safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.</p>
<p>After the fatal 2016 Florida crash, NTSB asked six automakers with advanced driver assistance systems &#8211; Tesla, Volkswagen AG, BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co, Daimler AG and Volvo Car &#8211; to &#8220;develop applications to more effectively sense the driver&#8217;s level of engagement and alert the driver when engagement is lacking while automated vehicle control systems are in use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All manufacturers except Tesla have responded to the NTSB, explaining their current systems and their efforts to reduce misuse and keep drivers engaged,&#8221; the NTSB said.</p>
<p>While Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.</p>
<p>The NTSB said that had the driver in the case been paying close attention, &#8220;he could have taken evasive action to avoid or mitigate the collision.&#8221;</p>

<p>The European Space Agency said on Tuesday it had altered the trajectory of one of its observation satellites to avoid a possible collision with a craft operated by Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;@ESA&#8217;s #Aeolus Earth observation satellite fired its thrusters, moving it off a collision course with a @SpaceX satellite in their #Starlink constellation,&#8221; the agency&#8217;s official Twitter account said.</p>
<p>It said its scientists decided that the safest plan of action was to boost the altitude of the craft, adding that the maneuver on Monday was the &#8220;first time ever&#8221; it had acted to avoid an active satellite.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vast majority of ESA-avoidance maneuvers are the result of dead satellites or fragments from previous collisions,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>A SpaceX spokesperson said that a bug in its on-call operating system prevented the team from seeing that the risk of a collision with the ESA craft may have increased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had the Starlink operator seen the correspondence, we would have coordinated with ESA to determine best approach, with their continuing with their maneuver or our performing a maneuver,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>SpaceX, founded by billionaire Musk in 2002, this year launched a constellation of 60 broadband-beaming satellites in a project known as Starlink.</p>
<p>The initial launch prompted astronomers to raise an alarm over the risk of a possible collision, and briefly threw up a spate of UFO sightings over the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SpaceX says the Starlink constellation could eventually reach 12,000 satellites.</p>
<p>Faced with an increase of privately run craft, which currently number around 20,000 in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, the ESA will hold a meeting in November focused on space security.</p>
<p>The agency launched Aeolus in 2018.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s research icebreaker Xuelong, with 126 crew members aboard on the 35th Antarctic research mission, on Thursday local time left the Zhongshan Station on its way back to China. </p>
<p>Snow Eagle 601, China&#8217;s first fixed-wing aircraft for polar flight, on Thursday night also departed from the Antarctic after completing all assignments. </p>
<p>Xuelong arrived near Zhongshan on Feb. 9. It supplied the station with fuel oil, then picked up summer expedition team members at the Kunlun, Taishan and Zhongshan stations, as well as members of the fixed-wing aircraft project. </p>
<p>Sixteen members of the Kunlun team previously completed all scientific expeditions at Dome Argus (Dome A), the South Pole&#8217;s highest icecap. They, together with 21 members of the Taishan team, returned to Zhongshan on Feb. 8. </p>
<p>The Zhongshan team completed tasks including installation of and tests for LiDAR, drilling of ice bedrock, atmospheric sounding observation, surveys of birds and aerial exploration carried out by the fixed-wing aircraft. </p>
<p>As the summer expedition team at Zhongshan left, 19 members stay for winter expeditions. </p>
<p>Also known as the Snow Dragon, the icebreaker carrying a research team set sail from Shanghai on Nov. 2 last year, beginning the country&#8217;s 35th Antarctic expedition. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-March.</p>

		<title>American, Chinese scientists identify new chemical pathway of air pollution in China</title>

<p>American and Chinese researchers proposed to bring a new pollutant under control in order to reduce extreme air pollution in China. </p>
<p>The study published on Thursday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters showed that a key to reducing regular wintertime air pollution in the country was to reduce the formaldehyde emissions. </p>
<p>&#8220;We show that policies aimed at reducing formaldehyde emissions may be much more effective at reducing extreme wintertime haze than policies aimed at reducing only sulfur dioxide,&#8221; said Jonathan M. Moch, a graduate student at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and first author of the paper. </p>
<p>During days in Beijing with especially high particulate air pollution or PM 2.5, the sulfur compounds significantly increased, which tend to be interpreted as sulfate, so China typically focused on reducing sulfur dioxide. </p>
<p>Although the sulfur dioxide over eastern China has decreased substantially since 2005, particulate air pollution hasn&#8217;t been rooted out. </p>
<p>The researchers found that the instruments used to analyze haze particles might misinterpret sulfur compounds as sulfate when they are molecules called hydroxymethane sulfonate (HMS). </p>
<p>HMS is formed by the reaction of sulfur dioxide with formaldehyde in clouds or fog droplets. Formaldehyde is a strong-smelling gas, used especially to preserve parts of animals or plants for biological study. </p>
<p>The researchers demonstrated that HMS molecules might constitute a large portion of the sulfur compounds observed in PM2.5 in winter haze. It would help explain the persistence of extreme air pollution events despite the reduction of sulfur dioxide or SO2, according to them. </p>
<p>The primary sources of formaldehyde emissions in eastern China are vehicles and major industrial facilities such as chemical and oil refineries, according to the study. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our work suggests a key role for this overlooked chemical pathway during episodes of extreme pollution in Beijing,&#8221; said Loretta J. Mickley, senior research fellow in SEAS under Harvard. </p>
<p>The study was a collaborative effort with Harvard University, Tsinghua University, and the Harbin Institute of Technology.</p>
