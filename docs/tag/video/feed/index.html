<p>During commercial breaks in the broadcast of World Wrestling Entertainment&#8217;s WWE SmackDown, fans were shown ads for Walt Disney Co&#8217;s new streaming service, Disney+. So were Monday Night Football viewers and video gamers watching Twitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to keep up,&#8221; said Captain Marvel in one ad after a series of fast-paced clips from Star Wars, The Simpsons, The Avengers and other Disney-owned hits from outside its deep catalogue of children&#8217;s classics.</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s marketing force is reaching beyond its traditional family audience to send the message that its $7-a-month subscription service Disney+ offers something for all ages. The service debuted on Tuesday in the US, Canada and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incumbent upon us to market it the right way to emphasize the fact that it&#8217;s not just for kids,&#8221; Disney executive Kevin Mayer said during a briefing at the company&#8217;s Burbank, California, headquarters. &#8220;It&#8217;s all family-friendly, but everyone can enjoy this product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disney has told investors it can hook 60 million to 90 million users within about five years as it competes for customers in a crowded streaming market dominated by Netflix Inc.</p>
<p>Signing up adults who do not have children at home is part of that plan.</p>
<p>Consumers may not realize that after a series of acquisitions, Disney is much more than classics like Cinderella and Mary Poppins that charmed generations of families. The company now owns the celebrated Star Wars movie franchise; Iron Man, the Hulk and dozens of other Marvel superheroes; Toy Story animation house Pixar, and nature programming channel National Geographic.</p>
<p>Previously released movies and TV series from all of those brands, plus 30 seasons of The Simpsons, are available on Disney+ alongside decades of Disney&#8217;s family-centric offerings.</p>
<p>Disney+ also offers new programming from those brands.</p>
<p>To raise awareness, the company is promoting Disney+ during sports and primetime TV telecasts to get in front of what Hollywood calls the four quadrants of viewers: male, female, young and old.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re unmatched in quality and appeal across our four-quadrant audience spanning a variety of genres, formats and arenas, and will continue to build on that year after year,&#8221; said Ricky Strauss, president of content and marketing for Disney+.</p>
<p>In addition to the wrestling, football and gaming contests, ads ran during the World Series and the ABC News late-night program Nightline, and on social media networks.</p>
<p>Early testing in the Netherlands, where Disney offered a free two-month trial of Disney+, attracted a &#8220;very large and diverse audience,&#8221; said Mayer, who runs Disney&#8217;s direct-to-consumer and international unit.</p>
<p>Marvel&#8217;s Agents of SHIELD, a series aimed at 18 to 49-year-olds, ranked as the most-watched piece of content, Mayer said. Next was tween-oriented show The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody, followed by Disney&#8217;s Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, a cartoon for young children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hypothesis was we will have a lot of different types of viewership, that it&#8217;s not going to be centered among any one of our brands,&#8221; Mayer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a nice confirmation of what we want accomplished.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initial response in the Netherlands has cheered industry analysts.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have some surprising and encouraging signs about this potential, that Disney+ is not just [for] kids and family,&#8221; Forrester analyst Jim Nail said.</p>
<p>But unlike Netflix, Disney+ limits how far its programming will go to attract older viewers. To keep it family-friendly, the service will not have any R-rated movies or TV shows designated TV-MA for mature audiences.</p>
<p>Programming considered too adult for Disney+ may stream on Hulu, which Disney also owns. That will include FX series such as American Horror Story and Fargo, and possibly movies starring Deadpool, a Marvel character known for foul-mouthed humor, when rights become available.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are boundaries to what we&#8217;ll put on Disney+,&#8221; Mayer said. &#8220;Deadpool is definitely not for Disney+.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Glitch</span></strong></p>
<p>However, Disney&#8217;s long-awaited debut in the streaming media war on Tuesday was hit with technical glitches that the company said were caused by higher-than-expected demand as it takes on rival Netflix Inc.</p>
<p>It was unclear how many people successfully signed up and how many had difficulty accessing Disney+, which features roughly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from the company&#8217;s deep family-entertainment catalog as well as new programming.</p>
<p>&#8220;The consumer demand for Disney+ has exceeded our highest expectations,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
