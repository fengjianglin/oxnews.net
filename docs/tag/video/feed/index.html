<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">File photo: VCG</p>
<p>During commercial breaks in the broadcast of World Wrestling Entertainment&#8217;s WWE SmackDown, fans were shown ads for Walt Disney Co&#8217;s new streaming service, Disney+. So were Monday Night Football viewers and video gamers watching Twitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to keep up,&#8221; said Captain Marvel in one ad after a series of fast-paced clips from Star Wars, The Simpsons, The Avengers and other Disney-owned hits from outside its deep catalogue of children&#8217;s classics.</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s marketing force is reaching beyond its traditional family audience to send the message that its $7-a-month subscription service Disney+ offers something for all ages. The service debuted on Tuesday in the US, Canada and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incumbent upon us to market it the right way to emphasize the fact that it&#8217;s not just for kids,&#8221; Disney executive Kevin Mayer said during a briefing at the company&#8217;s Burbank, California, headquarters. &#8220;It&#8217;s all family-friendly, but everyone can enjoy this product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disney has told investors it can hook 60 million to 90 million users within about five years as it competes for customers in a crowded streaming market dominated by Netflix Inc.</p>
<p>Signing up adults who do not have children at home is part of that plan.</p>
<p>Consumers may not realize that after a series of acquisitions, Disney is much more than classics like Cinderella and Mary Poppins that charmed generations of families. The company now owns the celebrated Star Wars movie franchise; Iron Man, the Hulk and dozens of other Marvel superheroes; Toy Story animation house Pixar, and nature programming channel National Geographic.</p>
<p>Previously released movies and TV series from all of those brands, plus 30 seasons of The Simpsons, are available on Disney+ alongside decades of Disney&#8217;s family-centric offerings.</p>
<p>Disney+ also offers new programming from those brands.</p>
<p>To raise awareness, the company is promoting Disney+ during sports and primetime TV telecasts to get in front of what Hollywood calls the four quadrants of viewers: male, female, young and old.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re unmatched in quality and appeal across our four-quadrant audience spanning a variety of genres, formats and arenas, and will continue to build on that year after year,&#8221; said Ricky Strauss, president of content and marketing for Disney+.</p>
<p>In addition to the wrestling, football and gaming contests, ads ran during the World Series and the ABC News late-night program Nightline, and on social media networks.</p>
<p>Early testing in the Netherlands, where Disney offered a free two-month trial of Disney+, attracted a &#8220;very large and diverse audience,&#8221; said Mayer, who runs Disney&#8217;s direct-to-consumer and international unit.</p>
<p>Marvel&#8217;s Agents of SHIELD, a series aimed at 18 to 49-year-olds, ranked as the most-watched piece of content, Mayer said. Next was tween-oriented show The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody, followed by Disney&#8217;s Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, a cartoon for young children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hypothesis was we will have a lot of different types of viewership, that it&#8217;s not going to be centered among any one of our brands,&#8221; Mayer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite a nice confirmation of what we want accomplished.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initial response in the Netherlands has cheered industry analysts.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have some surprising and encouraging signs about this potential, that Disney+ is not just [for] kids and family,&#8221; Forrester analyst Jim Nail said.</p>
<p>But unlike Netflix, Disney+ limits how far its programming will go to attract older viewers. To keep it family-friendly, the service will not have any R-rated movies or TV shows designated TV-MA for mature audiences.</p>
<p>Programming considered too adult for Disney+ may stream on Hulu, which Disney also owns. That will include FX series such as American Horror Story and Fargo, and possibly movies starring Deadpool, a Marvel character known for foul-mouthed humor, when rights become available.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are boundaries to what we&#8217;ll put on Disney+,&#8221; Mayer said. &#8220;Deadpool is definitely not for Disney+.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Glitch</span></strong></p>
<p>However, Disney&#8217;s long-awaited debut in the streaming media war on Tuesday was hit with technical glitches that the company said were caused by higher-than-expected demand as it takes on rival Netflix Inc.</p>
<p>It was unclear how many people successfully signed up and how many had difficulty accessing Disney+, which features roughly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from the company&#8217;s deep family-entertainment catalog as well as new programming.</p>
<p>&#8220;The consumer demand for Disney+ has exceeded our highest expectations,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>

Photo: Screenshot from video by Global Times</p>
<p>Hong Kong police sergeant Lau Chak-kei, who was invited to participate in the celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, said that he looks forward to seeing the fireworks, climbing the Great Wall and eating roast duck in Beijing, and many Chinese internet users extended a warm welcome to him.</p>
<p>A total of 10 representatives of the Hong Kong Police Force, including Lau, were invited to the military parade and celebrations of the 70th anniversary. They arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be Lau&#8217;s first visit to Beijing and he told the Global Times on Sunday that it was an honor to represent the Hong Kong Police Force on the anniversary.</p>
<p>Lau attracted wide attention for pointing a shotgun at rioters in self-defense outside Kwai Chung police station in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on July 30. He has become a star on Weibo and has gained more than 510,000 followers as of Sunday.</p>
<p>Lau told the Global Times at the Hong Kong International Airport before leaving for Beijing that he has two main wishes for his Beijing trip: One is to see the military parade and the other is to go to the Great Wall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lau&#8217;s remarks attracted many Chinese netizens&#8217; attention and the video of his interview has been viewed more than 4 million times as of Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many netizens said that they were happy to see Lau come to the Chinese mainland, and that they hope he can enjoy his time in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome Lau sir! Thank you for your great effort in putting down the riots and maintaining peace and stability in Hong Kong,&#8221; one netizen commented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice to see you, but to go to the Great Wall is a bad idea during the Golden Week of the National Day as there will be too many people,&#8221; said another. &#8220;I will show you the best place to have authentic roast duck.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Hong Kong police, the invited representatives of the Hong Kong Police Force include police officers and some management personnel who participated in curbing the violence in Hong Kong in the past two months, the China News Service reported in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lin Zhiwei, chairman of the Hong Kong Police Forces Association and also one of the invited representatives, said in an interview with the China News Service that the invitation is a great honor and shows the affirmation from the central government for the work of the Hong Kong police. Lin said they will unswervingly overcome all the difficulties to maintain Hong Kong&#8217;s stability and prosperity.</p>

<p>A motorist in Jixian, North China&#8217;s Shanxi Province failed a breathalyzer test for drunk driving but eventually convinced police it was because he had eaten an egg yolk pie while driving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a drink for two or three days, but I&#8217;ve just eaten an egg yolk pie in my car,&#8221; the driver emphatically told a police officer, according to a Pear Video on Saturday.</p>
<p>He told police at the check stop that he and his family were on a driving holiday and he would never endanger their safety by driving drunk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The driver managed to convince a police officer to eat one of the pies and take the test himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the pie must contain alcohol,&#8221; the police officer said after eating the pie and failing his own breathalyzer test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the police were finally convinced the motorist had not been drinking alcohol, they nonetheless gave him a ticket for distracted driving &#8211; for eating while driving.</p>
<p>Many Chinese netizens were amused by the video.</p>
<p>&#8220;This story tells us that we need to bring at least two egg yolk pies with us, so we can give one to the police,&#8221; one netizen joked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to the video, I will be more careful about what I eat before I start to drive my car,&#8221; one netizen commented on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>An inventive handyman in Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing Municipality has amused neighbors and netizens with his homemade remote controlled miniature boats and airplanes that he builds from scrap materials he collects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deng Buping, a 58-year-old plumber and electrician, collects all sorts of materials that would normally be destined for the dump. Deng has turned used plastic water pipes and materials from a billboard into small racing boats, according to a video posted by Pear Video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, Deng says he has made drones, yachts, and tops from scrap he has stored in his overcrowded workshop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deng not only likes the challenge of building and designing things that float or fly, he also enjoys helping his neighbors fix their plumbing and electrical problems. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a professional plumber or electrician. It&#8217;s just my hobby and I will try my best to help the neighbors,&#8221; said Deng.</p>
<p>Deng says turning waste into something useful &#8220;gives me a lot of pleasure and a sense of self-achievement.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students accompanied by their parents have been getting plastic surgery at a hospital in East China during the summer vacation, as looking good is seen as becoming more and more important, said a doctor.</p>
<p>Huang Jinlong, chief doctor of the department of plastic surgery at a hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, told Pear Video that in his department, almost half of the patients who have been coming every day during the summer vacation are students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of them are accompanied by their parents,&#8221; Huang said, &#8220;Parents didn&#8217;t support their kids having surgery before, but now they&#8217;re asking them to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor explained that this change is due to a trend in society in which beauty is becoming more important in various situations, whether it is at school or at work.</p>
<p>Most students are choosing to have double eyelid surgery and others want to change their noses, facial sizes and body sizes through surgeries such as liposuction.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 30 surgeries take place each day and appointments for double eyelid surgeries are booked into next year,&#8221; Huang said.</p>
<p>Netizens have different opinions on this trend. Some believe that it is right for everyone to pursue beauty, but others criticized this trend of focusing only on how people look, saying that it can make society unhealthy.</p>

<p>An Australian chef in Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing Municipality has opened a burger shop that sells a Western favorite adapted for local tastes: a hot pot burger.</p>
<p>The chef, Paul, told Pear Video that he invented the burger because he wanted to cook something that can attract local people.</p>
<p>In addition to the lettuce and beef found in most burgers, the hot pot burger also features fried lotus root and sesame oil. What makes the burger really &#8220;Chongqing style&#8221; is a specially made sauce that tastes very much like hot pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hot pot lovers became jealous of Chongqing people after the shop went viral on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo. &#8220;OK, it&#8217;s time to book a ticket to Chongqing and try all the foods,&#8221; one Net user posted on Weibo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chongqing is famous for its hot pot and spicy cuisines. Some shops even sell ice cream and yogurt with hot pot sauce replacing the fruit jelly or chocolate toppings.&nbsp;</p>
