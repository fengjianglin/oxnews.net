Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn faced a national audience on Tuesday night in the first ever televised head-to-head clash between the country&#8217;s two top political leaders just weeks before the Dec. 12 general election. (Jonathan Hordle/ITV/Handout via Xinhua)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boris Johnson&#8217;s Conservative Party would win a comfortable majority in Britain&#8217;s parliament if the upcoming election were held this week, according to a poll by respected research firm YouGov.</p>
<p>Britain votes on December 12, with Prime Minister Johnson hoping to secure a majority to be able to push through his<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a> deal to take the country out of the European Union.</p>
<p>YouGov&#8217;s poll, published Wednesday, said if the elections were held on Thursday, the Conservatives would grab 44 seats from the main opposition Labour Party to win a 68-seat majority.</p>
<p>The data showed larger swings from Labour to the Conservatives in areas that are more pro-Brexit, especially in England&#8217;s northern and central regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;As expected, the key thing deciding the extent to which each of these seats is moving against Labour [is] how that seat voted in the European Union referendum&#8221; in 2016, said Chris Curtis, YouGov&#8217;s political research manager.</p>
<p>The poll &#8211; the first in this campaign to predict election results seat-by-seat &#8211; uses a model that correctly forecast 93 percent of seats in the last general election in 2017, according to YouGov.</p>
<p>It said the Conservatives&#8217; total seat count would climb to 359, compared to 211 for Labour &#8211; predicting that the left-wing party would lose 51 seats overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of seats won, this would be the Conservatives&#8217; best performance since 1987,&#8221; said the pollster, who analysed data including interviews with around 100,000 people about their voting intentions.</p>
<p>Johnson, who took over a minority administration in July and has been unable to speed his EU divorce deal through parliament, has pledged to take Britain out of the bloc by January 31.</p>
<p>If the center-right Conservatives are returned to power in the third general election in four years, he is promising to bring back his Brexit deal to parliament before<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>Among the smaller parties in the House of Commons, the poll said the Scottish National Party would gain eight seats to a total of 43, while the Liberal Democrats were predicted a total of 13 seats, Welsh party Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party one.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Rescuers work at the site of a collapsed building in the town of Durres, Albania, on Nov. 27, 2019. Some 40 hours after a strong earthquake hit Albania, 48 people have been rescued, as searches for more survivors are racing against time on Wednesday. The earthquake that hit the Balkan country early Tuesday morning has claimed 30 lives so far, according to the country&#8217;s Defense Ministry. (Xinhua/Zhang Liyun)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The death toll from the most powerful earthquake to strike Albania in decades rose to 40 on Thursday, after 10 more ­bodies were pulled from the rubble overnight, the defense ministry said.</p>
<p>The 6.4-magnitude earthquake rattled the Balkan state before dawn on Tuesday, leveling buildings and trapping ­bodies underneath the wreckage in towns near the Adriatic coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten more victims were found during the night, bringing the number of dead to 40,&#8221; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>With the help of experts flown in from across Europe, rescuers have been working tirelessly to clear away the debris of collapsed apartments and hotels in the coastal city of Durres and the town of Thumane, the two areas hardest hit by the quake.</p>
<p>Forty-six people have been pulled out alive so far and have been hospitalized, the defense ministry spokeswoman told AFP.</p>
<p>Hundreds of aftershocks have continued to rattle the country, sparking panic and temporarily halting search efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among some 650 who were injured, at least 10 are seriously wounded, the health ministry said. Thousands have been displaced, either because their homes were severely damaged or because it is still unsafe to return home because of the aftershocks.</p>
<p>The quake, centerd 30 kilometers west of the capital Tirana, was felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia, on the other side of the Adriatic Sea from Albania.</p>

<p>Canada&#8217;s Governor General Julie Payette on Wednesday started a two-day visit to Estonia for talks on bilateral ties and cooperation.</p>
<p>Payette met with Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid, Prime Minister Juri Ratas and President of Estonian parliament (Riigikogu) Henn Polluaas on the first day of her official visit to the Baltic country.</p>
<p>Kaljulaid referred to the &#8220;special bond between our peoples,&#8221; as around 25,000 people of Estonian descent currently live in Canada, which is one of the largest communities outside Estonia, the Estonian president&#8217;s office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Payette and her hosts discussed security and climate policy as well as digital cooperation. Canadian troops lead NATO&#8217;s enhanced Forward Presence battlegroup in Latvia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a similar understanding of the challenges we face on this planet &#8212; combating climate change and ensuring peace and security,&#8221; Kaljulaid was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Payette, Canadian astronaut and engineer, and Kaljulaid also attended a technology course at Tallinn Secondary School of Science, participating in a forum with members of the Estonian Space School Network and students in the space program at the Tallinn University of Technology.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Payette is scheduled to visit the e-Estonia Showroom, the Estonian Academy of Sciences and the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new president of the European Central Bank (ECB) Christine Lagarde signed here on Wednesday euro banknotes, vowing to nurture and sustain European citizens&#8217; trust in the single currency.</p>
<p>With currently 23 billion banknotes in circulation with a value of 1.26 trillion euros &#8212; a third of which are being used outside the euro area, the world&#8217;s second largest reserve currency has been playing a role in bringing Europe closer together, fostering a common identity and a sense of shared destiny in the currency bloc.</p>
<p>&#8220;It serves as the most tangible symbol of European integration, a process which has brought peace, freedom and prosperity to our continent,&#8221; Lagarde said at the signing ceremony which is customary ritual for the beginning of each ECB presidency.</p>
<p>Among ECB&#8217;s tasks such as implementing monetary policy, directly supervising more than 100 significant banks, &#8220;it is banknotes that are perhaps the most visible task for many European citizens,&#8221; said Lagarde.</p>
<p>&#8220;These banknotes are part of our economy, our identity and our culture,&#8221; she underlined, adding that the ECB has an immense responsibility to ensure that people maintain their trust in them.</p>
<p>As the ECB&#8217;s fourth president, Lagarde embarked on her eight-year term on Nov. 1, 2019.</p>
<p>Legally, both the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area have the right to issue euro banknotes. In practice, however, only the national central banks physically issue and withdraw euro banknotes. (one euro currently equals to 1.10 U.S. dollars)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Russian state space corporation Roscosmos said Wednesday it had moved the docking of the Progress MS-13 cargo ship with the International Space Station (ISS) to Dec. 9 at the request of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p>
<p>NASA requested the postponement due to the launch of the U.S. Dragon cargo ship to the ISS scheduled for Dec. 4, a Roscosmos statement said.</p>
<p>The launch of the Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket with the Progress MS-13 cargo spacecraft is scheduled for launch on Dec. 6 from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and its trip to the ISS will proceed according to the standard three-day scheme, Roscosmos said.</p>
<p>The ship will deliver to the station 700 kg of fuel and gas reserves, as well as 1,350 kg of various equipment and cargoes, including resource equipment for onboard control and life support systems, devices for scientific research experiments, sanitary and hygienic materials and medical control equipment.</p>
<p>It will also deliver to the ISS 420 liters of water and foodstuffs as well as a new track for a treadmill designed to maintain the crew&#8217;s physical condition in zero gravity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn held up what he said were 451 pages of previously secret documents that proved Johnson was seeking to put the ­National Health Service (NHS) on the table in a post-<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a> trade deal.</p>
<p>Britain goes to the polls on December 12, with Johnson hoping to secure a majority to be able to push through his divorce deal to take the country out of the European Union.</p>
<p>The funding and running of the NHS is a recurring election topic. Corbyn had previously obtained a redacted version of the document, which Johnson said was &#8220;an absolute invention.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Labour leader said the unredacted version catalogued six meetings between US and UK officials since 2017, detailing &#8220;what they [the Conservatives] don&#8217;t want you to know.&#8221; &#8220;The US is demanding that our NHS is on the table in negotiations for a toxic deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NHS was set up in 1948 under a Labour government, promising free healthcare for all &#8220;from cradle to the grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Labour has historically been its staunchest defenders and repeatedly warned the Conservatives have an agenda to introduce privatisation which would end free healthcare.</p>

(Xinhua/Shan Yuqi) </p>
<p>German conservative Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Wednesday to fight the threat of climate change while expanding economic growth as EU lawmakers&#8217; granted final approval for the bloc&#8217;s new executive who will lead on Sunday.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers confirmed Von der Leyen and her new European Commission in Strasbourg, France, with 461 voting in favor and 157 against.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a moment to waste any more on fighting climate change,&#8221; Von der Leyen told the assembly shortly before the vote in a speech delivered in English, French and German. &#8220;It will need massive investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she said green initiatives would have to be &#8220;inclusive&#8221; &#8211; a gesture to member states such as Poland that still rely on coal for jobs, energy and growth.</p>
<p>She said any new EU trade deals would include clauses protecting the environment.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen will be the first ­woman to hold the EU&#8217;s top job: European Commission president. The 61-year-old former German defense minister, who is succeeding Jean-Claude Juncker, will face a full in-tray including economic reform and migration as well as climate change.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes laws for the EU on everything from budgets to energy, negotiates trade deals around the world on behalf of the EU&#8217;s 500 million citizens and acts as the bloc&#8217;s competition watchdog, approving company mergers and setting rules for global tech giants such as Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>In her speech, she called for flexibility to be allowed under EU rules to help economies grow and promised to keep up pressure on upholding democratic standards.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said the EU&#8217;s door remained open for Western Balkan countries hoping for membership. On<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a>, she said she would always be a staunch &#8220;Remainer&#8221; at heart.</p>
<p>Her 27-strong team for the new Commission includes 13 women &#8211; the closest it has come to gender parity.</p>
<p>The new executive had been due to take office on November 1 but the politically fragmented European Parliament rejected three of the nominees, forcing a delay. The executive normally comprises one commissioner from each EU state, though Britain, which is due to exit the bloc, has declined to name a representative.</p>

<p>Albania was in national mourning on Wednesday as emergency workers continued to pull bodies from the ruins of buildings gutted by a violent earthquake, with nearly 30 found dead and hundreds injured.</p>
<p>Tirana declared a state of emergency in the areas hardest hit by Tuesday&#8217;s 6.4-­magnitude earthquake: the coastal city of Durres and the town of Thumane, where victims were trapped by toppled buildings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the help of dogs and more than 200 experts flown in from across Europe, rescuers worked through the night to locate survivors.</p>
<p>Early Wednesday in Thumane, emergency workers backed by Greek teams retrieved the body of a young man, an AFP reporter at the scene reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were also attempting to free a young woman who they believe is still alive after the 24-hour ordeal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Wednesday morning, the death toll was up to 28 while 45 people had been rescued, the defense ministry said in a statement. Some 650 people have also been treated for injuries, mostly minor, according to the health ministry.</p>
<p>The powerful quake, which struck just before 4 am (03:00 GMT) on Tuesday, was the strongest to jolt Albania in decades, according to authorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The priority is to save people&#8217;s lives,&#8221; said Prime Minister Edi Rama, who declared Wednesday a national day of mourning and announced a 30-day state of emergency for Durres and Thumane.</p>
<p>Festivities planned for Albania&#8217;s Independence Day celebration on Thursday and Friday have been canceled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thousands of people spent the night in tents or on the grass of the soccer stadium in Durres, where some 27 buildings were badly damaged.</p>
<p>Many were afraid to return home as more than 300 aftershocks were felt in Albania and the wider region following Tuesday&#8217;s quake.</p>
<p>In neighboring Greece, a strong 6.1-magnitude underwater earthquake shook the island of Crete on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are common in the Balkans due to the movements of two large tectonic plates &#8211; the African and Eurasian &#8211; and the smaller Adriatic micro-plate.</p>
