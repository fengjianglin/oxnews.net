<p>Ten films from the Chinese mainland were randomly selected from a pool of 62 to be released in the island of Taiwan in 2020, while there are no restrictions on films from Taiwan when they are released in the mainland.</p>
<p>The 10 chosen movies include<br />
<em>Vanguard</em>, starring Jackie Chan,<br />
<em>Li Na</em>, directed by Peter Chan, and<br />
<em>Ash is Purest White</em>, which was nominated for the main competition of the 71st Cannes International Film Festival in April 2018, according to a report from the Beijing Evening News.</p>
<p>An additional 52 movies also applied for a Taiwan release, including<br />
<em>Last Later</em>, jointly made by Chinese and Japanese artists, and 27 have been placed on a waiting list. If any of the initially chosen 10 films encounter problems and cannot be broadcast, these 27 movies will have the opportunity to replace them.</p>
<p>A quota system in Taiwan for films from the Chinese mainland means that only 10 movies can be released in Taiwan each year. This quota was initially filled according to a first-come-first-served basis, but as the number of applications increased, the process was changed to a lottery system.</p>
<p>Analysts say the rule leads to the delayed release of popular movies from the Chinese mainland in Taiwan. For example,<br />
<em>Ash is Purest White</em>, which was popular in 2018, will be broadcast in Taiwan after two years when it is already available online.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council published 31 measures to benefit the island of Taiwan in February 2018, which placing no limits on the number of films and TV series produced in Taiwan that can be introduced in the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Xin Zhiyu, a producer of TV dramas from Taiwan, said that the beneficial policy can promote cultural exchanges in film and TV between the island and the mainland, and can offer more relevant work opportunities in Taiwan.</p>

<p>It was announced on Wednesday that Chinese crime drama<br />
<em>The Wild Goose Lake</em> will hit the mainland cinemas on December 6.</p>
<p>A trailer for the film, which stars Chinese mainland actor Hu Ge and Gwei Lun-mei from the island of Taiwan, was released on the film&#8217;s official Sina Weibo account on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The trailer briefly shows a fugitive man Zhou Zhennan (Hu) as he tries to escape the police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a press conference in Suzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province, on Tuesday, Hu said that &#8220;The director was patient and gave me a lot of guidance, but the shoot was not easy since the director wanted to dig deeper into the performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film premiered at the 72nd annual<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/983300.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cannes Film Festival</a> in competition on May 18. It currently has a 7.6/10 score on Chinese media review site Douban.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a movie, with a unique personal style full of innovations! Each shot of the lens is carefully crafted. Most of the story was shot at night and the chases, fighting and gun battles in this gangster drama also have their own unique expressions. I like this ridiculous story with blurred love and black humor,&#8221; one netizen commented on Douban.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Adele Haenel Photo: IC</p>
<p>French star Adele Haenel lodged a complaint on Tuesday against a film director she claims sexually harassed her between the ages of 12 and 15, her lawyers said.</p>
<p>The actress shook the French film industry earlier this month with accusations about being repeatedly touched and kissed by Christophe Ruggia, who directed her in her first film role.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old winner of two French Oscars initially refused to bring charges because she said so few sexual assault cases come to court in France. But she changed her mind and went to a police station in a Paris suburb on Tuesday to make a formal complaint against Ruggia.</p>
<p>The director, now 54, initially denied the accusations before asking Haenel to forgive him, saying: &#8220;I did not see that my adulation and the hopes I placed in her, might &#8211; given her young age &#8211; be distressing [for her].&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paris prosecutors had already opened a preliminary investigation after she detailed the alleged abuse in a lengthy livestreamed interview to investigative website Mediapart.</p>
<p>The interview was seen as a turning point for the #MeToo movement in France. It helped galvanize renewed criticism of controversial director Roman Polanski, whose new film An Officer and a Spy was released in France earlier this month.</p>
<p>Polanski, who has French citizenship, has been a fugitive from US justice since 1978 after admitting to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in a plea bargain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Days before his historical thriller opened, a French photographer claimed that Polanski had raped her in 1975 when she was 18 after beating her &#8220;into submission&#8221; at his Swiss chalet.</p>
<p>Valentine Monnier, a former model and actress, said she was pushed to finally speak out when the director compared himself to Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer wrongly persecuted as a spy by the French army at the turn of the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Promotional material for <em>Joker</em> Photo: IC</p>
<p>Reeling from the #MeToo movement, Hollywood has put toxic masculinity under the spotlight this year with a batch of Oscars contenders zeroing in on the father-son dynamic.</p>
<p>From Joaquin Phoenix in<br />
<em>Joker</em> to Brad Pitt&#8217;s Ad Astra, A-listers have flocked to roles which highlight the damage caused by sons&#8217; quests for their fathers&#8217; approval.</p>
<p>But none have confronted the theme more brutally and personally than Waves, the indie coming-of-age drama being tipped as an Oscars dark horse.</p>
<p>The film, portraying a black middle-class family in Miami which implodes following a tragedy, has been hailed as &#8220;a knockout&#8221; by the New York Times and an &#8220;intimate epic&#8221; by The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<p>Director Trey Edward Shults modeled the film&#8217;s strict patriarch on his own stepfather, whose overzealous coaching results in a hideous high-school wrestling injury &#8211; a trauma which is dramatized in the movie, and leads to devastating consequences.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a cautionary tale of the traditional idea of masculinity,&#8221; Shults, 31, told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to build these tough exteriors &#8211; we can be vulnerable, we can communicate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Described as a Dazed and Confused for the Instagram generation, the film shows how the expectation that teenage boys be strong, silent and stoic endures in US culture.</p>
<p>It was released this month by A24, the indie production house behind Oscar-winner Moonlight, with which Waves shares its setting and several themes.</p>
<p>Shults said he forged the central character after swapping stories with star Kelvin Harrison, whose musician father tried and failed to push him to follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would do these sort of intense therapy sessions&#8230; him talking about his father&#8217;s state of mind, his father&#8217;s father, where that stuff came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>The consequences of that pressure led, midway through the film, to what Shults calls &#8220;the ultimate tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, another character&#8217;s reluctant visit to reconcile with his dying biological father in the hospital is ripped directly from the director&#8217;s own life.</p>
<p>Filming the scene was &#8220;terrifying,&#8221; said Shults, adding that the plotline of a teenage boy dragged to the hospital bed by his girlfriend after years of not communicating was &#8220;as identical as can be&#8221; to his own life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like an all-consuming dread that hits you at, like, the pit of your stomach, reliving the most traumatic thing&#8230; It was cathartic. But it was hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The movie has stirred controversy in some parts because its director is white. Many of its poignant scenes about the black experience were shaped by Harrison and his on-screen father Sterling K. Brown (This Is Us).</p>
<p>But Shults said he did not set out to write about a black family until Harrison came on board, and racial politics were always secondary to universal themes of family grief.</p>
<p>In fact, race serves mainly to amplify the father&#8217;s intense drive to succeed. Being black means &#8220;we are not afforded the luxury of being average,&#8221; the father tells his son during one argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all Kel [Harrison]. That&#8217;s all with his dad. They had that very talk,&#8221; said Shults, who admits that trying to portray an African-American family&#8217;s experience was intimidating.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt like a lot of responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A <em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> diorama on display in Saks Fifth Avenue&#8217;s holiday windows in New York on Monday Photo: AFP</p>
<p>As Disney&#8217;s<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> was topping the North American pre-Thanksgiving weekend box office with a record $127 million debut, it also swept the Chinese mainland box office by taking in 341.4 million yuan ($48.5 million) over its opening weekend, according to Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan.</p>
<p>Released on Friday in North America, the film is a sequel to the original<br />
<em>Frozen</em> which hit the theater in 2013, an Oscar-winner, crowned with best animated film and best original song. &#8220;Let It Go,&#8221; its award-winning song has also gained global popularity and been translated into several different languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to deadline.com,<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> has claimed the record for the highest global opening weekend for an animated film. Disney is reporting that the film has brought in $350.2 million worldwide, beating out previous record-holder<br />
<em>Toy Story 4</em>&#8216;s $240.9 million opening back in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moviegoers have naturally taken to debating whether the sequel is better than the original.</p>
<p><em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> currently has a 7.3/10 on Chinese media review website Douban from more than 74,000 reviews, while the original has an 8.3/10 from 453,000 reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding which one is better, the opinions among Chinese audiences are divided, with the question itself sparking great debate on Douban.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a top-rated review, Douban user VictorZou originally gave the film a 7/10 after watching the midnight screening on Friday, saying it was a far cry from the first one. Later that same day, the author updated the review giving the film an 8/10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;After a whole day&#8217;s discussion with Douban users, I found that I was being too harsh. I became a Disney fan because of<br />
<em>Frozen</em>, so it was unavoidable for me to have too many expectations for<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>. Maybe it&#8217;s not a perfect sequel, but as a Disney animated film, the production quality is for sure top-notch. The surprising visual effects, the familiar dancing and singing, the attention to detail, these strengths cannot be denied.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another highly-rated review, Douban user Lu Guanjun noted that the songs in the sequel may not be as catchy as &#8220;Let It Go&#8221; and &#8220;Do You Want to Build a Snowman&#8221; from the first film, but the film did a far better job when it came to the storytelling and hitting the audience in the feels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may like<br />
<em>Frozen</em> better, or maybe you prefer<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>, but one thing you can be sure of is that the sequel is worth checking out,&#8221; concluded Lu.</p>
<p><strong>Controversy in South Korea</strong></p>
<p>A day ahead of China and the US,<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> was released in South Korea. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film boasts the third-biggest industry opening of any movie in South Korea ($31.5 million). While the film&#8217;s commercial success is sure to make theater owners happy, its dominance in cinemas has film industry insiders worried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday morning, several South Korean filmmakers called an emergency press conference in Seoul, urging people to be cautious about the monopolization of the film industry, according to a report from South Korean media outlet Mydaily.</p>
<p>South Korean director Chung Ji-young reiterated the importance of market fairness at the press conference. He pointed out that after the release of<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> in South Korea, the daily screen seat quota for his recent work<br />
<em>Black Money</em>, which came out on November 13, had been reduced from 900,000 to 300,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The decrease happened within a day. I am making an appeal against such unfair phenomenon,&#8221; said Chung.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The director noted that he was aware that such an appeal could cause a backlash against<br />
<em>Black Money</em>, but it would be worth the sacrifice if it drew people&#8217;s attention to fairness within the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The filmmakers at the press conference pointed out that their intention was not to attack<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>, but rather to address a long-standing issue within the industry. They also suggested that relevant laws and policies should be implemented to prevent monopolies, rather than relying on the cinemas and film production companies to solve the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may like<br />
<em>Frozen</em> better, or maybe you prefer<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>, but one thing you can be sure of is that the sequel is worth checking out,&#8221; concluded Lu.</p>
<p><strong>Controversy in South Korea<br /></strong><br />
<br />A day ahead of China and the US,<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> was released in South Korea. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film boasts the third-biggest industry opening of any movie in South Korea ($31.5 million). While the film&#8217;s commercial success is sure to make theater owners happy, its dominance in cinemas has film industry insiders worried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday morning, several South Korean filmmakers called an emergency press conference in Seoul, urging people to be cautious about the monopolization of the film industry, according to a report from South Korean media outlet Mydaily.</p>
<p>South Korean director Chung Ji-young reiterated the importance of market fairness at the press conference. He pointed out that after the release of<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em> in South Korea, the daily screen seat quota for his recent work<br />
<em>Black Money</em>, which came out on November 13, had been reduced from 900,000 to 300,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The decrease happened within a day. I am making an appeal against such unfair phenomenon,&#8221; said Chung.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The director noted that he was aware that such an appeal could cause a backlash against<br />
<em>Black Money</em>, but it would be worth the sacrifice if it drew people&#8217;s attention to fairness within the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The filmmakers at the press conference pointed out that their intention was not to attack<br />
<em><em>Frozen</em> 2</em>, but rather to address a long-standing issue within the industry. They also suggested that relevant laws and policies should be implemented to prevent monopolies, rather than relying on the cinemas and film production companies to solve the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every story needs its hero and its villain. So when Fernando Meirelles decided to make a film about Pope Francis and Pope Benedict coming face-to-face, the director knew which pontiff he would side with.</p>
<p>For the first time in seven centuries the Catholic church has two living popes, and<br />
<em>The Two Popes</em> imagines a series of spirited debates between the strict, conservative Benedict and his charismatic successor.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the start of the film for me Benedict was the &#8216;bad pope&#8217; and Francis was the &#8216;good Pope,'&#8221; said Oscar-nominated Meirelles (<br />
<em>City of God</em>.)</p>
<p>But as the movie progressed, and the Brazilian director learnt more about both men, something started to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read some of his writings. And I watched some of his sermons. And he&#8217;s interesting,&#8221; the director told AFP at the film&#8217;s recent premiere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the press created this image of a Nazi, which is not really&#8230; he&#8217;s not very different from Pope Francis actually.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men on screen bridge their differences, bonding over Benedict&#8217;s piano-playing and Francis&#8217; beloved soccer team in conversations at the Pope&#8217;s summer residence, and in the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>The Netflix film, starring Welsh screen legends Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce as Benedict and Francis respectively, has quietly emerged as an Oscars contender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was written by New Zealander Anthony McCarten, whose last three films &#8211;<br />
<em>The Theory of Everything, Darkest Hour and Bohemian Rhapsody</em> &#8211; have all won the best actor Oscar for their leading men.</p>
<p>McCarten told AFP that &#8220;career-best performances by both men&#8221; in his latest film were undoubtedly worthy of Academy recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are &#8220;no more fitting recipients than either of them,&#8221; he said at the American Film Institute&#8217;s AFI Fest.</p>
<p>Hopkins said the glowing response to the film had been a &#8220;big surprise,&#8221; expressing hope that it could teach the world something about tolerance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk, sit down, stop being so grim about everything,&#8221; said the<br />
<em>Silence of the Lambs</em> Oscar-winner.</p>
<p><strong>Church scandals</strong></p>
<p>Pope Benedict&#8217;s shock 2013 resignation came against a backdrop of child sex abuse scandals and financial corruption. These events are touched upon in the film, but only fleetingly.</p>
<p>At one point, Francis hears Benedict&#8217;s confession &#8211; including his knowledge of historic sex abuse allegations against Mexican priest Marcial Maciel.</p>
<p>But the audio quickly fades to silence, leaving the audience to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to be very careful not to go [too] far,&#8221; said Meirelles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had more lines on child abuse [in the script] but if I had two extra paragraphs on that it would become a film on child abuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew that a specific Mexican cardinal had issues with kids, and he didn&#8217;t do anything, to avoid a big scandal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Benedict emerges as a surprisingly likeable figure &#8211; something Meirelles attributes to Hopkins&#8217; considerable charm.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a dramatist, I had to love both characters equally,&#8221; added writer McCarten.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Benedict &#8220;stands for tradition, orthodoxy, for something dependable, for a moral compass. Which is timeless, an eternal truth. And there&#8217;s a strength in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film also covers, in flashbacks, a dark period in Francis&#8217; past.</p>
<p>As head of Argentina&#8217;s Jesuits, he was accused of cozying up to the country&#8217;s brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Francis was and still is known as a divisive person in Argentina. It&#8217;s talked about in the film, it&#8217;s not shied away from,&#8221; Pryce told AFP. </p>
<p>The<br />
<em>Game of Thrones</em> star said he studied Francis&#8217; &#8220;flaws and weaknesses&#8221; &#8211; as well as his more admirable traits, like tackling inequality and climate change &#8211; to develop the character.</p>
<p><strong>Sistine Chapel</strong></p>
<p>The project presented a number of unique challenges, Meirelles admitted &#8211; not least the huge amount of dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The script is very good, but at the end of the day it&#8217;s two guys just talking,&#8221; joked the director.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous devices to keep the pair moving on screen were devised. At one point they order pizza to the Sistine Chapel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With no access to film in the Vatican City, a detailed replica of the world-famous pilgrimage spot had to be constructed from scratch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was beautiful, we spent 17 days shooting inside the set,&#8221; said Meirelles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect replica, exactly the same. So now I know it, like my home!&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The Two Popes</em> will be released in limited US theaters on Wednesday and on Netflix on December 20.</p>
