<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>With the pan-democracy camp capturing more than half of the 452 seats in the 2019 Hong Kong District Council elections, the city has come to a political turning point. It was an election held amid constant violence in the city. The result could be somewhat distorted, but the outcome can be seen as so-called mainstream public opinion. However, it also showed that level-headed thinking of the city is on the wane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe most Hongkongers would like to see chaos continue in their city. They wish for change, but their indignation and unwise choices would further push the city toward an abyss. The outcome of the election would mislead outsiders into believing that the so-called mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong is in favor of violence and confrontation while going against integration with the Chinese mainland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what concerns me more is Hong Kong getting lost.</p>
<p>The jurisprudence and fidelity to the Basic Law and &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle have not been established in Hong Kong, a city that still completely follows the &#8220;colonial&#8221; system under the common law and adopts practices consistent with the West. This is one reason behind the results of the latest district council elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government failed to deal with local youngsters according to the rule of law. The youth believe they can find justice by breaking the law. From the 2014 illegal<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/885027.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occupy Central movement</a> to the current unrest sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, the political landscape of Hong Kong has been increasingly polarized and radicalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The central government promotes rule of law in Hong Kong but it cannot persuade Hongkongers to follow its lead as the &#8220;two systems&#8221; concept has been misunderstood. Meanwhile, local groups&#8217; appeal for &#8220;democracy and welfare&#8221; targets the contradictions and demands of people under Hong Kong&#8217;s capitalist democracy.</p>
<p>Moreover, Western forces have been exercising influence in the city, which makes some Hongkongers believe they can challenge the &#8220;one country&#8221; principle.</p>
<p>When China-US ties were better and the &#8220;two systems&#8221; were getting along with each other, Hong Kong enjoyed the benefits of globalization. But when the world&#8217;s two largest economies clashed and the globalization order is changing, the city is facing an epochal puzzle &#8211; Where will it go?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The election result reflected a majority of Hongkongers&#8217; misunderstanding of &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle, the Basic Law, the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the community of shared future for mankind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The citizens of Hong Kong have only come across anti-China information in a world with freedom of information; they cannot perceive the changes in relations between China and the world although they stand at the pinnacle of globalization; they choose to wait and see and even run away when the Chinese nation is in a &#8220;golden era&#8221; of rejuvenation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever be the result of various elections in Hong Kong, the city&#8217;s autonomy and China&#8217;s sovereign right on the city will never change. The Hong Kong opposition can continue to force public opinion and collude with foreign forces to achieve political goals, but it is the city &#8211; not pro-establishment camp or the central government &#8211; that will suffer.</p>
<p>As Hong Kong tends to close its doors, it will continue losing attraction for elites from the Chinese mainland and the rest of the world. As a result, the city&#8217;s status as a financial hub and its reputation for higher education would be seriously affected. The window won&#8217;t be open too long for Hong Kong to seize the opportunity under the framework of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Hong Kong returned to the motherland, China has become the world&#8217;s second-largest economy and a power to shape the global order in the 21st century. Even if it positions itself on the opposite side of the central government, Hong Kong won&#8217;t influence much of the country&#8217;s development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All walks of life in Hong Kong should calm down and introspect after the district council election: Can violence really solve the problem? Does Hong Kong&#8217;s future lie in keeping distance from China&#8217;s national strategy and system? Will its unconditional and unlimited trust in the West really benefit the city?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easy to forge &#8220;public opinion&#8221; by spreading fear and violence. However, it is also an obligation of elites to educate and guide people to think rationally and jointly figure out the best way to realize local interests. Regrettably, Hong Kong&#8217;s governing and cultural elites have abandoned this responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Hongkonger should be absent in the great discussion about the city&#8217;s future. How Hong Kong can better integrate within the country is a topic more valuable than the &#8220;public opinion&#8221; trend in a specific election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2019 Hong Kong District Council Elections were held successfully on Sunday with the opposition capturing more than half of the 452 seats. The result was confirmed and respected. This has shown the central government&#8217;s sincerity in sticking to the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle.</p>
<p>Pan-democrats gained more influence through the ballot, which requires them to be more responsible to maintain order in Hong Kong. No matter what pan-democrats pursue, they must not do it at the cost of the rule of law, which is a core value of the city. The newly elected pan-democrat councilors should contribute to guiding the Hong Kong society to reach the consensus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being loyal to the Basic Law should be the prerequisite for every Hong Kong politician. This requires them to express political appeals through channels specified by the Basic Law, and respect its purpose.</p>
<p>The Basic Law assures the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, and solidly defends the &#8220;one country&#8221; principle in the city. Pan-democrats of Hong Kong need to be aware of and responsible for promoting coordination between the &#8220;two systems&#8221; and &#8220;one country&#8221; principle in the city. They must not lead the city to confront the central government. It&#8217;s believed most pan-democrats have the awareness of &#8220;one country&#8221; and won&#8217;t allow Hong Kong to become a bridgehead for the West to pressure China. This is the basic political ethics they should adhere to.</p>
<p>It is a wise choice for pan-democrats to promote democracy in Hong Kong while simultaneously safeguarding national security rather than undermining national security. Only after they straighten out this logic will they enjoy a broad and sustainable prospect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong radical opposition figures have colluded with the US and other outside forces in recent years. In the long run, those radicals will pay the price for temporary gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;One country, two systems&#8221; means to let Hong Kong people, not Westerners, rule Hong Kong. Beijing highly respects Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy, and won&#8217;t allow Western forces to meddle in Hong Kong affairs. Whoever helps Washington intervene in Hong Kong affairs is putting their political career at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid tensions between China and the US, Hong Kong pan-democrats should steer their political position well, keeping it in line with China&#8217;s national security. They should keep this in mind rather than covet short-term petty benefits and lose themselves.</p>
<p>Dozens of elected district councilors gathered near Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Monday to show solidarity with radical protesters, a move which highlights their political label. District councils typically focus on community issues, but some newly elected district councilors have acted as if they are members of the Legislative Council. It will go against the Basic Law if they want to turn themselves into the most active political force in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Democratic development in the city should be strictly in line with the Basic Law and coordinated with national security. Both Hong Kong and the central government need to figure out how to make it as &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; is still a new thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the world has deeply changed, to sustain &#8220;one country, two systems,&#8221; Hongkongers and mainlanders should seek truth from facts to solve various problems they face. Hong Kong will have a bright future only when they more closely join hands.</p>
<p>Pan-democrats gained more seats, but they should maintain political sobriety. The young newly elected, in particular, should keep a distance from those who betray the country and Hong Kong, and have the courage to explore a new political path in accordance with the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle. Hong Kong is a part of China, and never will it belong to the US or the West. Only by keeping this in mind and acting accordingly will they have a solid political career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-11-25/ed2d6da6-8652-4a2e-8011-4367f6746803.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>The US House of Representatives passed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on November 20 by a vote of 417 to one. The bill had unanimously passed in the US Senate on November 19, and is going to the White House for US President Donald Trump&#8217;s signature or veto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some analysts said Trump is facing a dilemma. If he signs the bill, China-US relations will be damaged; If he vetoes it, he will be acting against the will of the House and the Senate. It is very likely that Trump will sign the bill, because it is a new handy tool for the US to interfere in China&#8217;s internal affairs.</p>
<p>The bill requires the US government to conduct an annual review of Hong Kong&#8217;s status and re-evaluate whether the city warrants to be treated as a separate customs territory by the US. According to the bill, if the US believes there are so-called human rights abuses in Hong Kong, it can impose sanctions on Chinese officials concerned. If the bill is eventually put into force, it will have a very bad impact on Hong Kong and will further affect Hong Kong&#8217;s prosperity in the long run.</p>
<p>The US wants to use political issues, such as the degree of Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy and so-called human rights and democracy, to determine the city&#8217;s special economic status. The standard is completely in the hands of the US. Once the bill is implemented, Hong Kong&#8217;s efforts to stop violence and restore order will be disrupted. The bill will harm the interests of Hongkongers. As Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said on November 20, the bill will undermine US interests in Hong Kong as well. It still remains to be seen how the bill will be applied if it is signed.</p>
<p>The real purpose of the US is not to review Hong Kong&#8217;s so-called democracy and human rights every year, but to contain China. The bill has almost gained unanimous support in both the House and Senate, which shows that trying to contain China has almost become a consensus in the US. Hindering China&#8217;s development may be the only consensus reached by political elites in the Republican and Democratic parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the bill is signed, it will affect the Chinese mainland in the short run, because Hong Kong and the mainland are closely connected economically. This is an important reason why Joshua Wong Chi-fung, one of Hong Kong&#8217;s pro-West radial riot leaders, and anti-China forces in the US support the bill.</p>
<p>However, in the long run, China will find ways to deal with the bill. For the moment, China should do its own things properly. It is opening its doors increasingly wider. As long as the country remains internally stable and prosperous, international capital will find alternative destinations other than Hong Kong.</p>
<p>More importantly, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government and Hongkongers should shoulder their responsibilities. The prosperity of Hong Kong is related with Hongkongers&#8217; own welfare, and they should act to protect it. To begin with, Hongkongers should not put up with the riots. The HKSAR government should use all necessary measures to stop the violence, restore stability in the city, and punish the radical separatists and activists who would not hesitate to be traitors just for personal gain.</p>

<p>There is a group of academic elites in the US who have kept a close watch on the situation in Hong Kong. These so-called scholars insist on the supremacy of their Western values and refuse to acknowledge the fact that China&#8217;s system is more suitable to its current situation &#8211; particularly after China repeatedly dismissed their conspiracy theories on it. They feel discomfort and try to vent their anger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since US President Donald Trump had threatened to veto the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights Democracy Act, they came out to voice their support for the bill and condemned their democratically elected president for failing the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christian Whiton, a senior fellow at the Center for the National Interest and former adviser to the Trump administration, said on Friday that it would be foolish if Trump does not sign the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shows people coming from behind the scene to the stage. In the 1920s, Edward Bernays, who is widely regarded as father of public relations and propaganda, outlined how to control what people think. His theory was believed to be the origin of the &#8220;color revolution&#8221; concept. Some American scholars may have followed Bernays&#8217; theory and played an important role in the current Hong Kong unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These people have taken Hong Kong and Taiwan as &#8220;fortresses&#8221; and &#8220;experiment fields&#8221; of democracy. Together with Washington, they use the two places as leverage to contain China, and infiltrate education and social groups of Hong Kong with their thinking and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some US academic institutions and foundations, such as the Washington DC-based National Endowment for Democracy (NED), regard Hong Kong as a laboratory and have done so-called experiments, in addition to funding local organizations to preserve so-called democratic rights &#8211; in line with the protests &#8211; and help organize training seminars for scholars, lawyers and civil servants.</p>
<p>For instance, the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions &#8211; the city&#8217;s second-largest labor group that supported the &#8220;umbrella movement&#8221; in 2014 &#8211; has reportedly received donations from the NED worth about $2 million in the past two decades.</p>
<p>According to a conference paper issued by the Boston-based think tank National Bureau of Economic Research in June, some researchers have &#8220;indirectly incentivized&#8221; Hong Kong university students to participate in the July 1 marches in 2017 and 2018 for &#8220;scientific purposes,&#8221; and paid them up to HK$ 350 ($45) for individual surveys. Nearly 850 subjects completed all four study waves.</p>
<p>The escalating violence in the city excited these US elites and also worried them. They were excited to see their anticipated so-called democratic movement taking place in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, they were worried they would miss the precious chance to advocate their political ideas and actively support the US government while violating international norms by intervening in China&#8217;s domestic affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the unrest escalates in Hong Kong, they have completely removed their academic veneer and showed their true anti-China intentions. We have become clearer about what they are really up to. But as it had happened several times in the past, their evil intentions will eventually collapse amid China&#8217;s steady pace forward.</p>

<p>Hong Kong district council elections were held in a largely safe and orderly environment on Sunday. A few radical opposition figures attempted to disrupt the proceedings to make it difficult for pro-establishment candidates and their supporters, but it did not have much impact. People had worried that unrest sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill could force the cancellation of elections, but that didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>Voting results show that pro-democrats have scored a landslide victory, winning a majority of the 452 seats open to elections, though the difference in actual votes received by the two camps was much smaller.</p>
<p>Hong Kong district council is different from the legislative council. As a publicly elected institution of 18 districts of Hong Kong, the district council&#8217;s function is to serve the community, express public&#8217;s appeal regarding livelihood, such as transportation, environment, and living conditions. This year&#8217;s district council elections were full of political slogans because of the extradition bill controversy. But regardless, neither side has much room to politicize the district council elections.</p>
<p>The unrest sparked by anti-extradition bill is still ongoing, which is conducive for pro-democracy camps to mobilize support in a short span of time. Hong Kong has been engulfed by riots in recent months, during which the irrational political energy has had its impact on elections, particularly exerting pressure on pro-establishment candidates and their supporters.</p>
<p>It must be pointed out that the West has been helping HK opposition in district council elections in the past week. Australian media suddenly broke a story of a Chinese spy infiltrating HK defecting to Australia (The man is a convicted fraudster). A former employee at British Consulate General in HK detained 3 months ago on the mainland for soliciting prostitutes told BBC last week he was tortured during detention. They are intended to influence public opinion on Hong Kong. US lawmakers hastily passed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, also targeting district council elections.</p>
<p>Hong Kong radical forces and Western supporters behind them wanted to stage a political demonstration during the voting. They tried to deny the urgency of ending chaos in Hong Kong. But we want to say that the pro-democracy camp winning more seats doesn&#8217;t mean Hong Kong voters support violent demonstrations. Majority of Hongkongers are tired of violence and are yearning for order to be restored.</p>
<p>Election result showed that there is still emotion within Hong Kong society, affecting rational thinking over the key issue of how the city should walk out of its current predicament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is conceivable and impossible that majority of Hongkongers would encourage violence, support political confrontation against the mainland, and back the city to become a bridgehead for US political forces to pressure China. This is because it will severely undermine the interests of Hongkongers and push the city into an environment of uncertainties. It is crucial to rationally interpret the result of Hong Kong&#8217;s district council elections, lest mobs should be emboldened by misreading them.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland follow different political systems. Expressing views by constitutional provisions such as votes should be encouraged in Hong Kong. The district council elections have had their impact but such influence has its limits. Both sides should be respected by all. All forces in Hong Kong, including the opposition, must compete for influence in the establishment. No one should follow the devious path of street politics.</p>
<p>It is believed that whatever the ups and downs in Hong Kong polls, all elections in the city are held within the aegis of the special administrative region of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, and they can&#8217;t impact the basic framework of &#8220;one country, two systems.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hoped that the pro-establishment groups in Hong Kong will not be discouraged, and Hongkongers who love the country and the city will not be disheartened after the district council elections. As long as elections are held, there will be swings. What&#8217;s more, in such an unfavorable situation, the pro-establishment camp still received about 40 percent of the votes.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s development and progress are unstoppable. Hong Kong&#8217;s politics will certainly be increasingly linked to China&#8217;s development and progress. This is the major historical trend. The country will never abandon Hong Kong, and will never ignore the people and forces who love the motherland and the city. Hong Kong&#8217;s problems need objective analysis and practical solutions. The country will always provide guarantees for Hong Kong.</p>

<p>At a sensitive moment during the US-launched trade war, which has already wreaked havoc on the world economy, it&#8217;s extremely dangerous to make Hong Kong a part of the China-US row and complicate the situation further.</p>
<p>A prominent US senator has warned that Hong Kong could lose its special US trade status if Beijing &#8220;intervenes directly to crack down on increasingly violent pro-democracy protests&#8221; in the city, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong affairs are a Chinese internal matter and the US has no right to interfere. Amid trade war woes, the US should avoid crossing the red line to interfere in China&#8217;s internal affairs. Hong Kong is an integral part of China. The one-China policy is the political foundation for China-US relations. Any remarks that violate it will deliver a deadly blow to bilateral ties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Washington considers Hong Kong as a bargaining chip to place pressure on Beijing amid the trade war, there will be a dangerous gridlock in China-US relations.</p>
<p>The ongoing trade war has intensified to full pitch, focusing on not only tariffs but also areas such as technology and finance. The scope of the trade war has been expanded, but we advise the US not to touch the bottom line of China-US relations.</p>
<p>Some Americans are making a mistake when they define terrorist-like attacks in Hong Kong as pro-democracy protests. The situation has escalated with Molotov cocktails being thrown at police. How Beijing backs the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region&#8217;s government to fight against terrorist-like attacks is a Chinese internal affair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US absolutely has no reason to crack down on Hong Kong&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, Beijing is unlikely to reduce its support to the Hong Kong economy. If the US pursues unfair treatment toward Hong Kong or imposes economic sanctions, the Chinese central government has the ability to offset the losses caused by such US measures and secure economic stabilization in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The US has slammed media reports on a US envoy who met radical protesters in Hong Kong, trying to curb speculation that terrorist-like attacks in the city were fueled by the West. However, fresh comments by the US senator added to the evidence that the US wants to play a role in the current situation in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The threat of withdrawing the city&#8217;s special trade status suggests the US has no intention of supporting Hong Kong&#8217;s economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong is known as the gateway between the Chinese mainland and the rest of the world. It&#8217;s the mainland that can support the economy in Hong Kong. Beijing won&#8217;t abandon Hong Kong&#8217;s economy no matter what may happen.</p>
