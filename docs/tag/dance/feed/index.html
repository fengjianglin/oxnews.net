<p>A high-level forum on art development was held on Saturday in Quanzhou, East China&#8217;s Fujian Province, a city widely seen as the starting point of the ancient Maritime<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/ReportsfromtheSilkRoad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silk Road</a>.</p>
<p>Focusing on exchanges and mutual learning between Chinese and foreign arts and civilizations, the forum was part of the ongoing Maritime Silk Road International Art Festival.</p>
<p>Participants at the forum, including some 140 researchers and artists from around the world, voiced the shared view that the spirit of the Silk Road, which represents peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit, should be upheld in developing art and culture.</p>
<p>Addressing the opening ceremony, Zhu Qi, an official with the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/22.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Culture</a> and Tourism, said enhanced cultural exchange could forge stronger people-to-people bonds and build stronger public support for advancing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</p>
<p>Suzanne Ogge, a Singapore-based specialist with the 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, acknowledged the positive effect made by the forum in a world that seems to be splintering and where many communities and traditional relationships seem to be splitting apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is incredibly positive to bring people together from so many different countries and from China to discuss ways on a larger scale, where social, economic and cultural cooperation can take place with such peaceful objectives,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tian Qing, a researcher with the China Central Institute for Culture and History and a renowned musician, highlighted the idea of &#8220;harmony in diversity&#8221; in traditional Chinese culture and noted that cultural dialogues under the BRI are not seeking to replace one culture with another, but to foster exchange and mutual learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;People can see themselves from the eyes of other people,&#8221; said Mohammad Aljaloos, also curator of the CAB Art Gallery.</p>
<p>Mychael Barrat, president of the London-based Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers, also shared his experience in creating a narrative map of the Silk Road based on intensive research.</p>
<p>The making of the map has been an adventure in its own right and has inspired him to greater ambition both in printmaking and in his travels, according to Barrat.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Silk Road is a destination for exploration and international dialogue that exists as much as a promise of the future as a relic of the past,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>A month after being caught smoking at a Beijing restaurant, Chinese teenage heartthrob Roy Wang (Wang Yuan) re-emerged by making a brief appearance on China Central Television&#8217;s (CCTV) flagship evening news Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the daily news program Xinwen Lianbo on Wednesday, Wang was seen singing with school children and several senior artists in another at an event featuring the route of the Long March carried out by the Chinese Workers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217; Red Army from 1934 to 1936. The event was held in Ganzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangxi Province, the starting point of the Long March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The broadcast came after he was caught smoking inside a restaurant in Beijing on May 21, which disappointed and upset many Chinese netizens who consider him a role model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang, 18, a member of the popular Chinese teen band TFBOYS and actor, was listed by Time magazine as one of the 30 most influential teenagers and appointed as a UNICEF Special Advocate for Education in 2017. He has 73 million followers on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wang apologized on his Weibo account later, saying that &#8220;I deeply regret my actions, and feel very sorry for the bad social influence&#8230;I will accept responsibility and punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>After watching Xinwen Lianbo, many Net users hailed Wang&#8217;s return and showed tolerance to the young star. Some netizens on Weibo said Wang should follow the spirit of the Long March and strive to be a better public figure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not his fan. But he has apologized sincerely and paid for his carelessness. Nobody&#8217;s perfect. Overall, it is good to see Wang repair his mistake,&#8221; a Beijing-based media professional who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said that our society is tolerant and kind to outstanding youth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold">Zhao Le performs Indian dancing in a Beijing restaurant. Photo: Mukesh Sharma</p>
<p>She slithers onto the podium to the beat of a Hindi number, her lithe frame twirling into a classic Bollywood pose. Amid the whirl and swirl of an ethnic Indian costume and throbbing music, the dancer&#8217;s gyrations reach a rapid beat. So does the mood in the restaurant.</p>
<p>Some diners start tapping their feet under the square tables while others turn to look intently.</p>
<p>Zhao Le has been doing this for more than a decade. Six years ago, it was on a dais in an Indian restaurant in Beijing&#8217;s CBD. Today, she has leaped onto a podium at another of the restaurant&#8217;s branches in Wudaokou on the other side of the capital.</p>
<p>At 28, the chirpy Le has mesmerized audiences with a variety of tastes and heritage. While Indian diners find in her an epitome of their culture thousands of kilometers from home, the Chinese marvel at one of their own serenading an exotic artistic tradition, an example of two civilizations coalescing into a symphony.</p>
<p>Lily&#8217;s (Zhao&#8217;s alias) journey into &#8220;dancedom&#8221; began when she decided to make the art her vocation and joined the Beijing workshop run by Kuchipudi (a dance from the southern Indian state of Karnataka) exponent Hari Om, who coached her for two months.</p>
<p>Laxman Hemnani, owner of the restaurant chain in Beijing, said a number of Chinese dance enthusiasts have learned classical dance forms from a teacher at the Indian embassy&#8217;s culture center. He would train them in Bharat Natyam (from Tamil Nadu in South India) and other classical dance forms for free. Le knew some students who had learned it from Hari Om, and was in turn trained by them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Movie mania</span></strong></p>
<p>Many Chinese audiences love Bollywood music from Indian director Raj Kapoor&#8217;s movies, Awara being one. They are also fond of tracks from Jeetendra&#8217;s (Indian film star of yesteryear) film Caravan.</p>
<p>So is Le, who is eager to visit India, the birthplace of the art she practices.</p>
<p>Owner of Wu Yuan Dance, a workshop for children, Lily slips into the role of a teacher when she is not making Indian dance palatable to patrons at the restaurant. Bollywood films have also impressed the woman who, in her Indian costume, looks like a native from the northeast of India.</p>
<p>Dangal, 3 Idiots and Baahubali have been Lily&#8217;s favorites Indian movies. Struggling to explain her admiration for the Indian films, Lily says: &#8220;I love Hindi movies,&#8221; adding in halting English that she has been watching them for many years.</p>
<p>Expatriate diners relish Lily&#8217;s way of flitting between Hindi film numbers with practiced ease, often joining her to shake a leg. Her photographs with patrons have been shared on WeChat and other social media platforms, says Hemnani.</p>
<p>Lily&#8217;s entire dance wardrobe is sourced from India. &#8220;A Chinese designer based in New Delhi sends me all my costumes,&#8221; she says with a twinkle in her eyes before breaking into an impromptu jig.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Cultural push</span></strong></p>
<p>Indians living in China, particularly Beijing, say the Indian embassy has been enthusiastic in promoting India&#8217;s dances. Hundreds of Chinese citizens have benefited from the free dance training offered by the cultural center affiliated to the Indian mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;After getting trained at the center, these girls in turn train other Chinese in the craft. There is a huge demand for learning Indian dance forms here, especially among 3 to 4-year-old girls,&#8221; says Hemnani.</p>
<p>Modern cultural ties between India and China can be seen as a continuation of cultural exchanges that go back hundreds and even thousands of years.</p>
<p>The town of Rajgriha (modern Rajgir) in the Indian state of Bihar was visited by Chinese traveler-monks who have recorded details of the physical setting of the place. Fa Xian, Xuan Zang and Yi Jing are among a number of scholars who visited India to study Buddhism and learn about Indian traditions and culture.</p>
<p>Xuan Zang, who visited India from 630 to 642, specialized in the Yogacara School of Buddhism. He is said to have returned to China carrying back images of Buddha and texts and notes.</p>
<p>The Indian dances that people usually see in China grew out of &#8220;Natya Shastra,&#8221; a Sanskrit treatise written by the sage Bharata in historical times. These graceful forms have crossed borders and have lent a perspective to Indian culture abroad.</p>
<p>This is probably what drew Lily to Hari Om&#8217;s workshop, after which she was able to slip into the role of an entertainer with practiced ease. She not only performs at the restaurant but also displays her art before larger audiences who are generally part of corporate groups touring China. She and another dancer have regaled visiting Indian groups and other customers at gatherings on different occasions.</p>
<p>You could say Lily is the cultural ambassador of India in China, despite being a Chinese.</p>
