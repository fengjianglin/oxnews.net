<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The Tibetan Traditional Medical University in Lhasa holds a renaming ceremony in 2018. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Tibetan Traditional Medical University celebrated its 30th anniversary of founding on November 16.</p>
<p>As China&#8217;s first university for Tibetan medicine, the school in Lhasa, Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region, has maintained 7,000 talents on Tibet medicine. The university has six key national-level labs and provides seven undergraduate courses, according to the website of the university. The university has sent experts to promote Tibetan medicine in 24 countries around the world.</p>
<p>The development and achievements of Tibetan Traditional Medical University go along with the process of developing Tibetan medicine in China.</p>
<p>Tibetan medicine, or Sowa Rigpa in Tibetan, is over 2,000 years old. Tibetan medicine was developed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In the past decades, it has prospered in China with public policy support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November 2018, UNESCO inscribed China&#8217;s Lum medicinal bathing of Tibetan medicine, or Sowa Rigpa, a part of Tibetan medicine, on the representative list of intangible cultural heritage of humanity.</p>
<p>In the past years, India has been seeking to recognize Tibetan medicine as its own intangible cultural heritage by trying to apply to UNESCO. It has approved establishment of an institute in a disputed border region.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Born on the plateau</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Tibetan medicine is originally from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which evolved with local people&#8217;s production and daily life and finally developed into a comprehensive Tibetan medical system,&#8221; said Feng Xin, deputy director of the Department of Medical Affairs at the Beijing Hospital of Tibetan Medicine.</p>
<p>Luobu Zhaxi, vice director of the Tibetan Medical Center at the China Tibetology Research Center in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday that the development of Tibetan medicine has seen great achievements in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: Global Times</p>
<p>China has 94 Tibetan medicine public hospitals, a monastery hospital and five higher education institutes for maintaining talent.</p>
<p>According to Article 21 of China&#8217;s Constitution, the country &#8220;promotes modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Scientific approval</span></strong></p>
<p>According to Luobu Zhaxi, previously Tibetan medicine lacked support from experimental data, which has been a barrier for it to work with modern medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;People might think as Tibetan medicine uses minerals, so it is toxic,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but minerals are just the ingredients. There is also the process to remove the toxin inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that China is working on collecting experimental data and safely evaluating Tibetan medicine.</p>
<p>China is also working to standardize Tibetan medicine.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology under Chinese Academy of Sciences have produced standard samples for six ingredients used in Tibetan medicines, the Science and Technology Daily reported in July. A lab specialized on the standardization authentication in the institute has been approved.</p>
<p>More than 300 Tibetan medicines have been approved by the medicine administration department in China, among which some are included in the health care system, Luobu Zhaxi said.</p>
<p>A total of 40 companies together make an annual output value of 6.5 billion yuan (920 million) on producing Tibetan medicines, he said.</p>
<p>Companies that produce Tibetan medicines could enjoy tax benefits according to China&#8217;s policies to develop Tibetan medicine.</p>

<p>The Jinhe Tibetan medicine company in Northwest China&#8217;s Qinghai Province has saved 15 million yuan thanks to the policy. The company used the money to upgrade its technology and buy two new automatic production lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ganlu Company in Tibet Autonomous Region uses the 6 million yuan saved from taxes to increase employment, which also helps reduce poverty in Tibet.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>India&#8217;s attempt</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>In an article titled &#8220;India, China spar over legacy of Tibetan medicinal system&#8221; by Press Trust of India (PTI) on Sunday, an anonymous Indian official said that &#8220;India has approached UNESCO, seeking the enlisting of the Sowa Rigpa as its intangible cultural heritage.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The official noted that India was &#8220;strongly pushing&#8221; the UNESCO application. The Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga &amp; Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy, has closely worked with the Ministry of External Affairs on the issue, according to PTI.</p>
<p>PTI reported that India&#8217;s Union Cabinet on November 20 approved setting up a national institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh, Ladakh.</p>
<p>&#8220;India set the Tibetan medicine institute in Ladakh on purpose, so that India could assimilate the region in order to merge Ladakh into India,&#8221; Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow at the institute of international relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;India has been hyping its work on Tibetan medicine,&#8221; Hu said, adding that India wants to transfer its people&#8217;s attention away from economic decline by worsening China-India relations.</p>
<p>On October 31, the Indian government announced the establishment of the Union Territory of Ladakh, which involves Chinese territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is illegal, null and void,&#8221; Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said at that day&#8217;s press conference. &#8220;It will neither change the fact that the relevant region is under China&#8217;s actual control nor produce any effect.&#8221; </p>

<p>Tibetan medicine has prospered in China, and India&#8217;s latest move to set up a Tibetan medicine institute in the disputed region Ladakh aims to hype its efforts in Tibet medicine development and is a futile attempt to stir disputes with China, Chinese experts noted, after Indian media reported that New Delhi was seeking to recognize the system as India&#8217;s own intangible cultural heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;The home of Tibetan medicine is in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China and it has been developing here,&#8221; Qin Yongzhang, an ethnologist at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>Luobu Zhaxi, vice director of the Tibetan Medical Center at the China Tibetology Research Center in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday that the development of Tibetan medicine has seen great achievements in China with constitutional support. China now has 94 public hospitals of Tibetan medicine, five higher education institutes for maintaining talent and an annual output value of 6.5 billion yuan ($923 million) on producing Tibetan medicines, he said.</p>
<p>Luobu Zhaxi noted that China is working on safety evaluation and experimental data collection for Tibetan medicine.</p>
<p>In November 2018, UNESCO inscribed China&#8217;s Lum medicinal bathing of Sowa Rigpa, which is a part of Tibetan medicine, on the representative list of intangible cultural heritage of humanity.</p>
<p>Tibetan medicine, or Sowa Rigpa in Tibetan, is over 2,000 years old. It has absorbed influences from traditional Chinese, Indian and Arabic medicine, according to the Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>According to a report by Press Trust of India (PTI) on Sunday, an anonymous Indian official said that &#8220;India has approached UNESCO, seeking enlisting of the Sowa Rigpa as its intangible cultural heritage.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The official noted that India was &#8220;strongly pushing&#8221; the UNESCO application.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PTI reported that India&#8217;s Union Cabinet on November 20 approved setting up a national institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh, Ladakh.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is illegal, null and void,&#8221; Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said at that day&#8217;s press conference. Chinese observers said India&#8217;s move challenges China&#8217;s sovereignty and warned that India&#8217;s decision risked border frictions despite bilateral ties developing on a progressive track.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a downturn in India&#8217;s economy, but will it become a protracted one? More specifically, will economic growth fall below 5 percent?</p>
<p>Credit rating agency Moody&#8217;s has slashed India&#8217;s GDP growth estimate to 5.6 percent for 2019. The GDP growth rate slipped to 5 percent year-on-year between April and June, the fifth consecutive quarter of deceleration. If the downward spiral in the economy continues, GDP growth will soon break below the 5-percent psychological barrier.</p>
<p>About a year ago, India was the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy, but now it faces a sharp slowdown. Why has the economy fallen off the cliff?</p>
<p>Initially, India&#8217;s economic expansion decelerated because of a decline in investment growth, but now the downward spiral is mainly being driven by slowdowns in consumption and manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A private survey showed expansion in the country&#8217;s manufacturing sector hit its slowest pace in 15 months in August. Some time ago, India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled an economic strategy aiming to turn India into a global manufacturing hub, but the slowdown suggests the &#8220;Make in India&#8221; campaign hasn&#8217;t been a success story.</p>
<p>Thus, growth in the Indian economy is likely to fall below the key level of 5 percent in the coming months, unless New Delhi draws up strong stimulus policies or carries out big economic reforms. The economy is edging closer to the alert line, but it seems New Delhi lacks awareness of the seriousness of the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent stimulus measures announced by the Indian government are deemed by many to be insufficient to reverse the economic slowdown, so there&#8217;s a high probability that GDP growth will continue to weaken.</p>
<p>The Modi administration has set many economic goals but given little attention as to how they are to be achieved. There are no clear indications that the Indian government has a strong stimulus plan to boost growth and stabilize the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of size alone, India has one of the world&#8217;s largest economies and is one of the biggest potential markets for many multinational companies. But if India&#8217;s GDP growth falls below 5 percent, the world economy may feel a chill. Chinese investors must prepare for the worst-case scenario if India&#8217;s economic problems continue to deteriorate.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi Photo: IC</p>
<p>India&#8217;s decision not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) shows its vacillation over a move of momentous significance for the region. The world&#8217;s largest free trade agreement has come close to fruition. However, one of the largest economies in the world with the second-biggest population hasn&#8217;t agreed to enter its fold.</p>
<p>Giving its reasons for deciding not to take the plunge into the free trade agreement, New Delhi said, &#8220;(the RCEP Agreement) also does not address satisfactorily India&#8217;s outstanding issues and concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>The RCEP came close to culmination during the 35th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/996882.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN</a>) Summit and the East Asia Summit held recently in Thai capital Bangkok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RCEP is the largest regional free trade agreement launched by ASEAN in 2012. It will have a far-reaching impact on the world economic and trade structure and geopolitical pattern. In fact, since 2012, RCEP negotiations have been delayed several times because of India dragging its feet.</p>
<p>India, which has waffled over the issue, has been a beneficiary of regionalization and globalization and a defender of multilateral cooperation. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, the government has actively promoted the transformation of India&#8217;s foreign policy. New Delhi has not only upgraded the strategy from &#8220;Look East&#8221; policy to &#8220;Act East&#8221; policy, but also seeks a greater impact in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indian government fears that the RCEP will hurt the fragile manufacturing industry of India. The growth of India&#8217;s economy is slowing down amid a large downward push. Although the Modi government has promoted &#8220;Make in India&#8221; initiative, joining the RCEP would expose it to the impact of three world-class manufacturing powers &#8211; China, Japan and South Korea. Small workshops, tiny businesses and small entrepreneurs could be devastated, and even the &#8220;Make in India&#8221; initiative will be imperiled.</p>
<p>For a long time, India has harbored the ambition of becoming a &#8220;powerful country with diplomatic discourse,&#8221; and with the rapid growth of its economy in recent years, it has positioned itself as a big country and carried out major-country diplomacy. But if India joins the RCEP, it would have to play second fiddle to China and Japan given the size of their economies. This would put India in a tight spot. Hence, India&#8217;s vacillation is a way of highlighting its importance in this region.</p>
<p>The trend of globalization and regionalization is obvious. Multilateralism and free trade constitute important paths to the future. However, nationalism and populism leading to protectionism is short-sighted behavior that focuses on immediate interests. The country will eventually suffer the consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is clear that the progress of the RCEP is a major victory for free trade in the pursuit of globalization and multilateralism. The fact that India did not join the RCEP for the time being shows that it wants to continue to share the dividends brought by multilateralism; at the same time, India does not want to offend the countries that promote protectionism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a big country and an important economy, India should take its responsibilities seriously. However, the South Asian nation has repeatedly used talks to block and delay the progress of the RCEP for its own interest. The expectations from the RCEP, an embodiment of global multilateralism in the new era, are high. Instead of supporting the RCEP, India on the contrary tried to delay the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the saying goes, you cannot have your cake, and eat it. India intends to have it both ways, as well as keeping the flexibility of its foreign policy. The South Asian nation will find itself in a dilemma that would be of its own making. It will lose the opportunity of development along with links to the international community. At the same time, New Delhi will not be able to reap the benefits of protectionism either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China has revised its drug laws to reduce penalties for the sale and import of unapproved drugs, sending a signal that the country may take an open mind toward cheaper generic drugs, especially those from India, to give poor and critically ill patients greater opportunities to extend their lives.</p>
<p>India is a leader in the world&#8217;s generic drug market. Generics made in India are often as effective as, but much cheaper than, brand-name drugs made in the West. India&#8217;s pharmaceutical exports reached $17.3 billion during the period from April 2017 to March 2018, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If India can gain access to the market in China, which has about 1.4 billion people, India&#8217;s pharmaceutical exports are likely to get a big boost.</p>
<p>The Chinese black comedy Dying to Survive, which hit Chinese theaters in July 2018, made many Chinese people aware that there is a large demand for India&#8217;s generic drugs in China. It seems that the Chinese authorities have noticed this and are trying to find a way to solve this problem. The latest revision in drug laws is an important step for opening up the Chinese market to India&#8217;s generic drugs. We believe that China will continue its reforms in pharmaceutical registration and give better access to Indian medicines.</p>
<p>Big demand for India&#8217;s generic drugs has promoted the development of underground generics trade in China. After the new law comes into effect, the underground trade is likely to be exposed to sunlight, and continue its development and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, generics can become a bright spot in India&#8217;s exports to China and help narrow the South Asian country&#8217;s trade deficit with China.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s trade deficit with China was $26.9 billion in the first half of 2019, according to Chinese customs data. If India&#8217;s generic drugs win market access in China, the trade deficit will be greatly reduced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Challenges persist, however, and making India&#8217;s generic drugs fully available in China won&#8217;t be easy. However, as long as reforms are beneficial to Chinese and Indian people, we believe the governments in both countries will roll out domestic reforms and spur pharmaceutical trade between the two countries.</p>

<p>China does not need to use balloons to gather intelligence on India, and if balloons have indeed been deployed along the borders of Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region, as Indian media reported, they are likely only for China&#8217;s own border protection or civil purposes, Chinese military experts said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Surveillance devices launched on balloons have limited abilities, so China would not use such a method to see across the border, Li Daguang, a professor at the National Defense University of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Satellites nowadays provide clear images on the ground, making balloons unnecessary, Li noted.</p>
<p>Li&#8217;s remarks are in response to a Tuesday report by Indian media outlet The Print, which claimed that China &#8220;is using high-tech balloons to spy on India from Tibet.&#8221;</p>
<p>India is overreacting and being too sensitive, Chinese military observers said.</p>
<p>Doubting the report is true, Li nonetheless said even if China has launched balloons in Tibet, they would be intended for China&#8217;s own border safety.</p>
<p>Patrolling the border in high altitude areas like Tibet manually could be challenging, and that could be why balloons might be used, Li noted.</p>
<p>Such balloons could also be used for civil purposes, like telecommunication relays or weather monitoring, analysts said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Luo Xuan/GT</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />With Marvel&#8217;s blockbuster<br />
<em>Avengers: Endgame</em> and Lebanese film<br />
<em>Capernaum</em> released in China on April 24 and 29, respectively, the two titles are well positioned to earn big at the Chinese box office by taking advantage of the four-day May Day holiday. However, Indian movies are conspicuously missing from the screening schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, it is not just that there are no Bollywood movies scheduled during the holidays, but that China&#8217;s romance with Indian movies seems to be quickly fading. So far this year,<br />
<em>Andhadhun</em> was the only Indian movie released in Chinese cinemas, which is a bit unusual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, a total of 10 Indian movies were screened in the country. The number &#8212; though small compared to the total number of movies screened in China every year &#8212; was pretty telling of China&#8217;s sudden enthusiasm for Bollywood movies in 2018. During the seven years from 2011 to 2017, there were only eight Indian movies released in China.</p>
<p>After many years with one or two releases of Bollywood movies annually, 2017 saw the milestone release of<br />
<em>Dangal</em>, which grossed about 1.3 billion yuan ($193 million) in China, accounting for more than 60 percent of its global revenue, data from IMDb showed. The success of<br />
<em>Dangal</em> has directly led to the increased presence of Indian movies in China, which then saw the release of many others, such as<br />
<em>Secret Superstar</em>,<br />
<em>Bajrangi Bhaijaan</em>,<br />
<em>Toilet: A Love Story</em> and<br />
<em>Hindi Medium</em>.</p>
<p>However, Chinese audiences seem to have tired of Bollywood movies following this sudden influx of films from India. When Indian star Aamir Khan brought his new movie<br />
<em>Thugs of Hindostan</em> to China at the end of last year, the film still failed to impress Chinese audiences, even though the release featured scenes that were re-ordered to meet local tastes. While critics cited several major reasons behind the &#8220;flop,&#8221; such as an unattractive plot, lack of resonance with the local culture, and a saturated market for Indian movies, one thing is sure: Bollywood has lost its freshness in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>However, Bollywood still should not slack off in tapping the Chinese movie market. At present, China has already become the world&#8217;s second-largest movie market, just after the US. According to statistics from the State Film Administration, China collected 60.98 billion yuan in the domestic box office in 2018, up 9 percent from the 2017 box office revenue of 55.91 billion yuan. In addition to Hollywood and domestic blockbusters, some Indian movies also did well in China last year. For instance,<br />
<em>Secret Superstar</em>, which was screened in January 2018, grossed a whopping 747 million yuan at the Chinese box office, with<br />
<em>Bajrangi Bhaijaan</em> and<br />
<em>Hindi Medium</em> generating 285 million yuan and 210 million yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the broader perspective of Sino-India trade, Indian movies could also help reduce the country&#8217;s trade deficit with China somewhat. It is no secret that India has been complaining about its high trade deficit with its neighbor for a long time. According to a Bloomberg report, in the 2018 financial year, which ended on March 31, India cut its trade deficit with China by the most in more than a decade, thanks in large part to a 31 percent increase in its exports to China. And with China granting more access to Indian products, it can be said that the South Asian country&#8217;s export potential hasn&#8217;t been fully realized. As a cultural export product, Indian movies need to continue to tap the Chinese market to contribute to the shrinking trade deficit.</p>
<p>As to the waning enthusiasm of Chinese audiences toward Bollywood movies, producers and distributors on both sides of the border should learn a lesson from it and try their best to reverse the trend. Chinese audiences will still be attracted by movies with good storytelling, a fantastic script and great acting, so it is important to select high-quality films that appeal to Chinese audiences, especially those of interest to the young generation. In the meantime, since a movie&#8217;s screening slot will have a major impact on its final box office revenue, distributors should be cautious in choosing screening times for Indian movies. After all, it was not long ago that Chinese audiences rediscovered the appeal of Indian movies, and producers and distributors from both countries should at least work to maintain their interest now.</p>

<p>The leaders of about 40 foreign governments will attend the second<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Forum (BRF), which will begin in Beijing on Thursday, but India is likely to boycott the meeting. India&#8217;s possible absence is not surprising, and there is no need to read too much into it.</p>
<p>The relationship of the world&#8217;s two most populous countries is more complex than many other bilateral relationships, such as those of India and most of its other neighbors. Collaboration and competition both contribute to establishing comprehensive ties between the two emerging economies, and coordination on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is just a small part.</p>
<p>India is much stronger than years before, but it seems to have become more sensitive to changes in South Asia. The BRI that touches upon areas where the Indian people most feel vulnerable &#8211; Kashmir-related issues &#8211; deserves attention to avoid allowing the initiative to become a bottleneck in China-India relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bilateral trade and investment between China and India have been on an uptrend. Many possibilities lie ahead for the two countries. So why focus on negative sentiment toward the BRI?</p>
<p>The China-India relationship has passed through the most difficult times. The linchpin is finding the proper solutions to a range of practical problems. It&#8217;s impossible to solve every problem overnight, especially a lack of strategic mutual trust, but small achievements from revolving practical issues will add up, elevating the bilateral relationship steadily to a higher level.</p>
<p>India has for long been worried about its large trade deficit with the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. China is willing to grant more market access to Indian exporters in a bid to explore India&#8217;s export potential in fields such as agriculture, film, tourism and labor-intensive industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Economic statistics have offered some positive signals as media reports said India cut its trade deficit with China by $10 billion to $53 billion in the financial year ended March 31, the most in more than ten years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a sound bilateral relationship needs to be reciprocal. We hope that India can provide fair treatment to Chinese enterprises and abandon its long-held mind-set that its own industries can only be developed by cracking down on foreign companies and imported goods, especially from China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there are differences over the BRI, China and India are likely to hold a Wuhan-style summit meeting this year to improve fraught ties. Informal dialogue between Chinese and Indian leaders will help create a comfortable atmosphere in which officials can take a pragmatic approach to solve practical problems faced by the two emerging giants.</p>

<p>While a boycott of Chinese products in India gets under way, China is caught up in a nationwide discussion over the &#8220;996&#8221; overtime schedule: working 12 hours a day from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. The two cases, seemingly unrelated to each other, in fact have their own inherent logic.</p>
<p>As some Indian people are choosing to boycott Chinese products, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the matter is for the public to decide. &#8220;As far as public sentiment toward Chinese goods is concerned, we should leave it to their sooj-bhooj (wisdom),&#8221; Modi told the Network18 group recently.</p>
<p>Some people think Modi has tacitly given consent to the boycott of Chinese products in India, but we don&#8217;t think so. Why can Modi trust the public&#8217;s wisdom? Because the boycott is doomed to fail and Indian people will eventually embrace a return to reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks India is able to boycott Chinese goods successfully needs to revisit the stories describing families who are trying to live an entire year without buying anything produced in China. They fail in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does China not need to worry too much about the call to boycott Chinese goods? India&#8217;s manufacturing sector is highly uncompetitive against China&#8217;s, which is able to offer daily necessities with a high performance-price ratio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ghost of nationalism may prompt some Indian people to boycott Chinese products in the short term, but they will finally choose products with a high performance-price ratio in the long term, no matter where those products are made. We need to trust the wisdom of Indian people.</p>
<p>How did China establish its competitiveness in the manufacturing sector during previous decades? This achievement can be partly attributed to the hard-working spirit of Chinese employees in labor-intensive industries, as well as research and development personnel and entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Chinese workers have embraced the &#8220;996&#8221; culture, while many billionaires in China work even longer hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wave of heated discussion on the &#8220;996&#8221; culture implies how common the schedule has become in China. But in India, foreign investors often complain about the relatively short working hours and high levels of social welfare enjoyed by local workers.</p>
<p>Adopting the &#8220;996&#8221; schedule can help India further improve its business environment, attract foreign investment and eventually enhance India&#8217;s competitiveness in the manufacturing sector. If inbound manufacturing investment from countries including China can help India produce goods with a high performance-price ratio, India will have a chance to win a victory over the campaign against made-in-China products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tough challenge lies ahead of India. Without the &#8220;996&#8221; schedule and the spirit of hard work, India can hardly catch up with China.</p>

<p>During the 2014 election campaign, India&#8217;s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the country had been led through &#8220;10 years of jobless growth by the Congress-led UPA Government,&#8221; and promised that after coming to power, it would &#8220;accord high priority to job creation,&#8221; according to Indian media reports. Five years later, similar accusations over &#8220;jobless growth&#8221; have rebounded on the BJP itself, as the Congress party highlights job creation in its election manifesto.</p>
<p>One achievement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his term has been that he made India the fastest-growing major economy in the world. Whether or not he wins re-election, there is no question that Modi has had a positive impact on India&#8217;s economy. But frankly speaking, India so far hasn&#8217;t found a fundamental solution to its &#8220;jobless growth.&#8221; Not enough jobs are being created in the populous nation, despite optimism about India&#8217;s prospects for economic development.</p>
<p>The specter of jobless growth is one of the toughest challenges facing the BJP during this year&#8217;s election campaign. To win a second term in office, Modi has to build public confidence that his administration can solve the employment problem.</p>
<p>Why hasn&#8217;t India&#8217;s high growth rate translated into a fast increase in jobs? In the past five years, India&#8217;s economic growth has been driven too much by domestic consumption, and its export sectors haven&#8217;t been fully developed. Indian manufacturers are mostly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited funds. But in the era of globalization, SMEs are generally less competitive than strong multinational foreign-based companies such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics. The competitiveness of products from such multinational companies is the outcome of technological advances, intensive production, lower input costs and abundant financial resources, none of which can be realized by SMEs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>India usually accords high priority to opportunities for entrepreneurship in a bid to shore up job creation. However, India can hardly develop an export-oriented economy by relying on small homegrown brands. The emerging country has to transform itself into a processing base for foreign-based companies to create jobs on a large scale.</p>
<p>China, which is having a boom in outbound investment, is an important global source of manufacturing investment. It is almost impossible to talk about attracting foreign investment without cooperation with China. A more rational attitude toward China is needed by India during the election campaign to deal with its jobless growth problem.</p>
