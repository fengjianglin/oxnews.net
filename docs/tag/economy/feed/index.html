<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The China Foreign Exchange Trade System building in Shanghai on August 24. Photo: VCG</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Foreign investors have been reinforcing their purchasing power on Chinese bonds, official data showed, with analysts giving credit to the reform and opening-up in China&#8217;s bonds market, and better interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign investors jumped at Chinese bonds in the first 11 months of the year, with cumulative net purchases reaching 970.2 billion yuan ($137.85 billion), data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) showed on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, transactions by foreign investors came to a total of 567 billion yuan, up 5 percent month-on-month and 127 percent year-on-year, CFETS said. That meant the total cumulative net purchases from foreign investors approached nearly 1 trillion yuan in the first 11 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>November was the 12th consecutive month that foreign investors overweighed Chinese bond holdings with continuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also notable that the number of foreign investors new to China&#8217;s interbank bond market in the first 11 months &#8211; 1,331 &#8211; has surpassed the total number in previous years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reforms and opening-up in China&#8217;s bond market have enabled more foreign investors to enter China&#8217;s financial market, as reflected by the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Shanghai-London Stock Connect and the country&#8217;s great efforts to build its offshore financial market, Liu Xuezhi, a senior economist at the Bank of Communications, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the risk of investing overseas is increasing with a declining yield rate under the pressure of the global economic downturn … but China&#8217;s bonds have relatively good returns on investment,&#8221; Liu noted, adding that foreigners&#8217; increasing purchasing power shows their confidence in China&#8217;s economy and financial development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2019 marks the lowest-performing year for global bond yields, but the interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds have surged to an historical peak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 10-year bond spreads between China and the US have surpassed 140 basis points, which is relatively high in history, Reuters said in August.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recorded around 131.5 billion yuan (about 18.7 billion U.S. dollars) in imports and exports in the first 10 months of this year, up 28 percent year on year, local authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>The autonomous region&#8217;s export volume during the period was 100.2 billion yuan, up 19.9 percent, while its import volume soared to 31.3 billion yuan, up 63.1 percent, according to the customs authorities of Urumqi, the regional capital.</p>
<p>In the first 10 months, Kazakhstan topped the list of Xinjiang&#8217;s major trade partners, with trade volume between the two growing by 28.2 percent to 60.2 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Xinjiang&#8217;s trade with Kyrgyzstan, Australia, Pakistan, Britain, Argentina and Vietnam also showed fast growth, according to the local customs authorities.</p>

<br />China&#8217;s central bank continued to pump cash into the money market in November to meet liquidity demand from financial institutions.</p>
<p>A total of 600 billion yuan (about 85.4 billion U.S. dollars) was injected into the market via the medium-term lending facility (MLF) last month to maintain liquidity in the banking system at a reasonably sufficient level, according to the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC).</p>
<p>The funds will mature in one year at an interest rate of 3.25 percent.</p>
<p>Total outstanding MLF loans reached 3.56 trillion yuan as of the end of November.</p>
<p>The MLF tool was introduced in 2014 to help commercial and policy banks maintain liquidity by allowing them to borrow from the central bank using securities as collateral.</p>
<p>In November, the PBOC also injected 4.8 billion yuan of funds through pledged supplementary lending to the China Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Agricultural Development Bank of China.</p>
<p>Another 62.25 billion yuan was lent to financial institutions through the standing lending facility to meet provisional liquidity demand.</p>
<p>The central bank has adopted open market operations more frequently to manage liquidity in a more flexible and targeted manner.</p>
<p>China has pledged to keep its prudent monetary policy &#8220;neither too tight nor too loose&#8221; while maintaining market liquidity at a reasonably ample level in 2019.</p>

<br /> Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin inaugurated the China-Russia east route natural gas pipeline by video link-up on Monday sending a signal that energy and cooperation in other sectors between the two countries are becoming the key to boosting multilateralism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entering service the same day, the pipeline will help Russia export up to 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to China, according to an article posted on the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) website on Monday.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s almost one-third of China&#8217;s total natural gas imports in 2018. About 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia will be delivered to China in 2020 and will be gradually increased to 38 billion cubic meters per year, the article said.</p>
<p>CNPC is responsible for the construction and management of the project within China: Stretching from Russia&#8217;s Siberia to China&#8217;s Yangtze River Delta, the pipeline covers 8,000 kilometers, of which 5,111 kilometers fall within Chinese borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project extends from Heihe in Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province to North China&#8217;s Hebei Province and finally to Shanghai in East China across a total of nine provinces and municipalities.</p>
<p>Russia will deliver a total 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas to China over the 30 years of contract, media reports said.</p>
<p>Following 20 years of negotiations, China and Russia reached the more than $400 billion contract in May 2014, the CNPC article read.</p>
<p>A China-Russia west route and China-Far East pipelines are also under discussion, the article said.</p>

<p>
<strong>Win-win deal</p>
<p></strong>Mutual benefit drove the two countries&#8217; energy development strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A &#8220;rapidly rising China needs a stable and reliable energy supply, while an increasingly powerful Russia also needs to participate in the world&#8217;s largest market,&#8221; the CNPC article said.</p>
<p>The pipeline will help stabilize China&#8217;s natural gas supply and guarantee the country&#8217;s energy security, especially if the situation ever changes for ocean transportation of natural gas in certain waters like the South China Sea, Jin Lei, an associate professor at the Beijing-based China University of Petroleum, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>The construction of the pipeline fits the country&#8217;s strategic energy blueprint, Jin noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline system in northwestern China, a China-Myanmar oil and gas pipeline in the southwestern region and about 20 liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the eastern region,&#8221; Jin said.</p>
<p>The construction of the China-Russia pipeline will make up for the lack of a cross-border natural gas pipeline in northeastern China, he said, noting that the China-Russia pipe is a strategic energy supply channel.</p>
<p>China is the world&#8217;s largest natural gas importer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, China imported 90.39 million tons (about 125.9 billion cubic meters) of natural gas, data from the General Administration of Customs shows.</p>
<p>The annual import of 38 billion cubic meters from Russia would account for nearly one-third of China&#8217;s annual total natural gas imports, and Russia is expected to be China&#8217;s largest supplier.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chinese demand, the pipeline will become an important channel for Russian exports, Jin said, especially if problems impede Russia&#8217;s natural gas export to Western Europe.</p>
<p>Europe is a big export market for Russian gas, with Gazprom alone exporting about 202 billion cubic meters to European countries and Turkey in 2018, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But those exports can suffer during political tensions.</p>
<p>The US and European countries oppose construction of Nord Stream 2, a Russian gas pipeline to Western Europe, over security concerns, The Los Angeles Times reported in June.</p>
<p>As a major resources export economy, Russia saw its natural gas production hit a record 725 billion cubic meters in 2018, of which 225 billion cubic meters were exported, Xinhua reported in January, citing Russian energy minister Alexander Novak.</p>
<p>The project deepens China-Russia relations, Chinese observers noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US has become a net exporter of oil for the first time in decades, noted Wang Yiwei, a director of China&#8217;s Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.</p>
<p>China-Russia energy and financial cooperation boosts multilateralism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia is not only a business partner, but more of a strategic partner in politics and diplomacy,&#8221; he told the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of the pipeline project will step up China-Russia cooperation in other aspects including regional cooperation and cyber-security, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the international backdrop that the US continues to contain China by even sacrificing its own interests, China supporting Russia is supporting itself,&#8221; Wang said.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s economy, second-ranked globally in nominal GDP terms and the largest based on an adjustment of GDP for purchasing power parity (PPP), will remain among the best performers in the global economic landscape in the upcoming year, China market watchers said.</p>
<p>Whether the economy can maintain 6 percent growth or not, it&#8217;s poised to retain its leading position and continue to serve as the locomotive of the global economy, they noted.</p>
<p>Green shoots of recovery are expected to be seen in both domestic and overseas markets in 2020, Guo Xiaobei, a researcher with China Minsheng Bank, told the Global Times, estimating the Chinese economy will post full-year expansion of around 6 percent in the next year.</p>
<p>Guo cited China&#8217;s implementation of various reform measures such as the ramped-up opening of the economy at an accelerated pace, monetary easing by major economies, hopes for a thaw in China-US trade tensions, and the UK&#8217;s effort to block a no-deal<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a>.</p>
<p>That suggests China will continue to power up the global economy, and the feat won&#8217;t be challenged by the possible scenario of growth falling below 6 percent, analysts said.</p>
<p>According to data from the World Bank, China&#8217;s GDP in current US-dollar terms totaled $13.61 trillion in 2018, second only to the US with $20.49 trillion. Japan held the third spot with $4.97 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going by GDP in PPP terms, China was already the largest economy with $25.36 trillion last year, followed by the US with $20.49 trillion and India with $10.50 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nation also excelled as measured by annualized growth rates. India was the fastest-growing major economy with 6.98 percent expansion in 2018, ahead of China with 6.6 percent growth. The US economy was in third place with 2.86 percent growth, according to World Bank statistics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With US growth expected to moderate in 2020 and India still struggling to recover from the shock of its economy slumping to a more-than-six-year low of 4.5 percent in the July-September period from 7 percent a year earlier, the estimates that China will remain the power of the global economy seem to hold up well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has topped the global rankings of contributions to global economic growth since 2006, according to a report released in August by the National Bureau of Statistics.</p>

<p>Though China has witnessed slow economic growth amid the China-US trade war, it has stabilized its job market thanks to the country&#8217;s tertiary industries, which have created more positions during the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading efforts.</p>
<p>The country&#8217; s steady employment situation refutes claims by US President Donald Trump that China had lost 3 million jobs due to the trade war. Experts gave credit to the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading and the appearance of new forms of flexible employment, saying the stable job market shows the resilience of China&#8217;s economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies in tertiary sectors told the Global Times that they had created millions of new job opportunities over recent years, and they have great demand for professional talent in IT, procurement, operations and services to support development in the future.</p>
<p>Industry reports showed that live-streaming, a new industry rising amid the fast development of the country&#8217;s internet sector, has generated a total of 4 million new jobs for the country; the food delivery industry has generated over 20 million job opportunities in both direct and indirect forms &#8211; some of which haven&#8217;t yet been factored into the official National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the downward pressure on the economy, one of the main factors necessary to maintaining the stable job market is the function of tertiary industries as a reservoir of employment,&#8221; said NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong, noting that tertiary industries cover a broad spectrum, with a growing number of enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 55 percent of employed people worked in tertiary industries in China, NBS said on November 20.</p>
<p>More and more Chinese graduates hope to work in tertiary industries, in companies such as those working with cutting-edge technology or the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>23-year-old postgraduate student Zhang Yali is looking for a job in the internet industry in Beijing. Majoring in journalism and communications, she would prefer a product-operations or user-operations position in an internet company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having commenced her job hunt in August, Zhang has applied for eight jobs in large Chinese internet companies such as tech conglomerate Tencent and ride-hailing services provider Didi Chuxing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though Chinese internet companies had mass layoffs at the end of last year, I still want to enter this industry because it is a driving force for economic development and working in this industry will be promising,&#8221; Zhang said. She knows the work will be challenging and require staying up late, but the industry will enable her to catch up with the pace of China&#8217;s economic restructuring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first 10 months of the year, China created 11.93 million new urban jobs across the country, meeting 2019&#8217;s annual target of more than 11 million new urban jobs in advance of the deadline. The unemployment rate in urban areas dropped 0.1 percentage points to 5.1 percent in October, mainly due to the improving employment status of graduates, NBS said.</p>
<p>Li Chang&#8217;an, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said that the improving employment absorption capacity in the services industry had effectively resolved employment difficulties in secondary industries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one of the hardest years for China, it&#8217;s a year full of change, it&#8217;s the year of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the year, China&#8217;s economy has endured a battle that hardly anyone had expected its toughness, showing high level of resilience. China fine tuned its policy, diversified industrial supply chains and deepened partnerships with more countries to successfully sail through a bitter trade war and global meltdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such adjustments are proven to be far more than effective, according to assorted economic data released recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s strategy has seen a shift this year. At first, policies had been churching out, focusing extensively on cutting costs and stabilizing foreign trade. Then, it dialed inward in boosting consumption. As the year&#8217;s end nears, China readjusted policy directions to beef up measures in optimizing business environment to sustain and attract investment,&#8221; Gao Lingyun, an Chinese Academy of Social Sciences expert, told the Global Times over the weekend.</p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called for more efforts to create a market-oriented and law-based business environment, according to a statement released after a State Council executive meeting chaired by Li. The foreign investment law is set to take effect on January 1, 2020.</p>
<p>Experts close to the government told the Global Times China is proceeding in a way to have a plan first and then implement it in a flexible manner. The country&#8217;s leadership and the general public are accepting the trade war with the US as a given fact and dealing it with a palpable level of calm and confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;At first, China indeed worried and responded passively. But now we&#8217;re taking the initiative and are comfortable with our own tempo and schedule,&#8221; Gao said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under a governing philosophy of preserving economic resilience while normalizing higher tariffs, China pursued goals step by step steadfastly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;China has an institutional edge over other Western countries including the US. Unlike their political system, which is crowded by conflicting opinions, we work together and we&#8217;re united &#8211; this is our biggest advantage,&#8221; Gao said. &#8220;The longer the trade war last, the bigger advantage we have in hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, China&#8217;s Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index rose to 51.8 from 51.7 in October, the fastest expansion since December 2016.</p>
<p>The unexpected expansion reflects the revival of industrial output and robust domestic economic growth underpinned by rising and consumption trends. It provides a contrasting reality to US President Donald Trump&#8217;s poor characterization on Chinese economy.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial chain diversification</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trade war, which Trump initiated, with China is in its 18th month now, despite negotiation. Huawei has been one of the US government&#8217;s targets in its tech blockade of China. The blacklisting cut off crucial US components suppliers to the Chinese company.</p>
<p>Huawei responded by launching its self-developed operating system HarmonyOS in August, providing a vivid example of how China is&nbsp; scaling up efforts to reduce reliance on US in the long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exporters based in Yiwu, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province,&nbsp; the world&#8217;s largest wholesale market, told the Global Times that diversification in markets had been underway since last year, under which orders to other countries in Europe and along the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative are taking shape.</p>
<p>Ying Daijun, chairman of Shifeng Decorative Lighting Co in Yiwu, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, told the Global Times that the company&#8217;s light exports to US now account for a negligible share of overall exports, while exports to India have soared to account for 40 percent of total revenue, the largest share.</p>
<p>The US was the company&#8217;s largest export destinations last year. &#8220;The US retailers are more desperate to call for the removal of tariffs than we are. And we&#8217;re fully prepared if trade conflicts further escalate,&#8221; Ying said.</p>

<p>The planned social insurance policy to be applied to people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in the Chinese mainland will promote talent flows and increase mutual understanding between mainlanders and the people from the three areas, experts said on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 2020, people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan who work, live or study in the Chinese mainland can enjoy the social insurance policies as mainlanders do, China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/14.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security</a> announced recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ministry said employers should give staff from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan social insurance, consisting of&nbsp;pensions, unemployment, medical, work-related injury and maternity, starting from 2020. Unemployed citizens from the three areas can join the urban and rural basic pension and medical insurance; college students from the three areas will enjoy the same insurance standards as the mainland students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a growing sense of belonging to our country since I heard the news. It boosts my confidence that I will live well in the mainland,&#8221; Hongkonger Leslin Tong told the Global Times on Monday. The measure is closely related to whether he could live and work in contentment in the mainland, he said.</p>
<p>Starting his company Minghu Information Technology months ago in Foshan, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province and one of the cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), Tong offers companies consultation services on business operation and offer his insights into the mainland market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tong said that before the new policy was announced, it cost him about 30,000 yuan ($4,260) to cure a serious illness in a hospital in Guangdong Province without enjoying the benefits of medical insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many attractive preferential policies for us that have come out recently, which give us equal national treatment as the mainlanders. I think there will be more Hongkongers coming to have a look at the mainland in the future,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amid the unrest in Hong Kong, the central government did not change guidelines for the coordinated development of the GBA. It is also giving employment preferential policies to talent from Hong Kong and Macao, which shows the good faith and sincerity of the central government,&#8221; a Hong Kong student at Peking University, Lam Tsz Kam, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The new policy, which will lower the cost of living, could attract talent from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, who will be employed, living or studying on the mainland. They will enjoy the same legal rights and interests of social security as their mainland peers,&#8221; Thomas Yeung Kwan-ho, research fellow of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Yeung added that the policy may attract high-end scientific research professionals, entrepreneurs and hospital executives to work in the mainland.</p>
<p>Ding Meng, senior strategy analyst of Bank of China&#8217;s Macao Branch, told the Global Times on Monday that the new policy will promote talent flows from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan to the mainland.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mainland&#8217;s social insurance will provide additional security for residents from the three areas living in the mainland, and meanwhile it will improve mutual understanding,&#8221; Ding said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March, the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/13.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Finance</a> announced preferential policies on individual income tax for talent from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and abroad working in the GBA.</p>
