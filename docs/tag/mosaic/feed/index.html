<p>The US House of Representatives is preparing to vote on its version of a bill concerning China&#8217;s internal affairs in its northwestern <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region. It is not good news for the US stock market.</p>
<p>Breaking news on the China-US trade war has been a factor fanning American stock market volatility in the past few months. With the Xinjiang-related bill in the pipeline, radical anti-China lawmakers in the US Congress have put China-US relations and the trade talks at risk. As a result, the US stock market should be prepared for a possible volatile run.</p>
<p>The Xinjiang-related bill is expected to harm Chinese firms&#8217; interests, which will force China to take countermeasures. US lawmakers may bet on China remaining silent on the Xinjiang-related bill, but China won&#8217;t do this.</p>
<p>Whatever countermeasures China adopts would spell bad news for the US stock market.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">A vehicle production line at a joint venture plant of General Motors in Wuhan, capital of Central China’s Hubei Province on September 1 Photo: CFP</p>
<p>New Buicks, Cadillacs and Chevys may soon start rolling out of factories across America again. On Wednesday, negotiators for United Auto Workers (UAW) and General Motors (GM) finally struck a deal aimed at ending their month-long dispute over the next four-year workers contract. The resolution brings less relief than expected.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the strike didn&#8217;t seem to hurt much, overall. It shouldn&#8217;t have happened at all. GM was guilty of some reckless driving in mid-September by not submitting a decent proposal until the union downing tools was all but inevitable. Even then, more than a few days of picket lines made little sense.</p>
<p>Union politics is partly to blame, too. Perhaps the UAW wanted to be seen flexing its muscles after at least a decade largely accommodating the needs of a struggling industry. And the union is also caught in the middle of an FBI corruption investigation that led to a search of President Gary Jones&#8217; house, among other locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That made the GM standoff a potentially useful distraction.</p>
<p>GM shareholders, meanwhile, were complacent. As of Wednesday afternoon, the company&#8217;s stock was some 5.5 percent below its pre-strike level, implying a hit to 2019 earnings of $500 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet the mean estimate of sell-side analysts reckons the cost could be as much as double that, Refinitiv data suggest, with some putting lost production alone as high as $2 billion.</p>
<p>The timing helped GM avoid the worst. It had an excess of vehicles waiting to be sold as the strike started. And it has the capacity to make up some of the lost production with overtime. That may have made a resolution less urgent for executives led by boss Mary Barra. Workers, who had to subsist on strike pay of just $250 a week for most of the time, clearly suffered. On this occasion, the company may have escaped with minor damage.</p>
