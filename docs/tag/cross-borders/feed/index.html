<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during the wrapping-up press conference of a two-day NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) defense ministers&#8217; meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Oct. 25, 2019. (Xinhua/Zheng Huansong)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The US is to cut its contribution to NATO&#8217;s operating budget, officials said on Thursday, with Germany increasing payments as the alliance tries to appease US President Donald Trump ahead of a summit next week.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly ­criticized European members for freeloading on the US, singling out Germany for lagging behind on an alliance commitment to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense.</p>
<p>While most of Trump&#8217;s anger has been focused on European national defense budgets, there has also been US grumbling about how much Washington contributes to NATO&#8217;s own running costs, and the 29-member alliance has now agreed to a change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the new formula, cost shares attributed to most European allies and Canada will go up, while the US share will come down,&#8221; a NATO official said.</p>
<p>The US currently pays 22.1 percent of the NATO budget &#8211; which totaled $2.5 billion in 2019 &#8211; and Germany 14.8 percent, under a formula based on each country&#8217;s gross national income. Under the new agreement, the US will cut its contribution to 16.35 percent of the total, Germany&#8217;s will rise to the same level and other allies will pay more.</p>
<p>Though the sums involved are small in military terms &#8211; the 29 alliance members spent a total of nearly $1 trillion on defense in 2018 &#8211; not all allies are happy with the move.</p>
<p>Diplomats say France has refused to go along with the new arrangement and will keep its contribution the same at 10.5 percent, arguing that the deal to change the figures was cooked up between Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel without properly consulting other allies.</p>

<p>The black boxes from two French military helicopters that collided in Mali killing 13 soldiers have been found, a French military spokesperson said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The crash occurred late Monday during an operation against jihadists in the Liptako region, near the borders with Burkina Faso and Niger. It was the heaviest single loss for the French military in nearly four decades.<br />
<center><br />
 &nbsp;<br />
</center>&#8220;The two black boxes from the helicopters have been recovered. They will be handed over to the relevant authorities to be analyzed,&#8221; the spokesperson, Colonel Frederic Barbry, told BFMTV.</p>
<p>Three helicopters and a squadron of Mirage jets arrived Monday to support ground troops pursuing Islamist extremists.</p>
<p>Shortly after troops engaged the insurgents, who fled on motorbikes and in a pickup truck, a Tiger attack helicopter collided with a Cougar military transport helicopter, killing all 13 onboard the two aircraft.</p>
<p>Barbry said no theory as to the cause of the crash is being ruled out, and it would be up to the investigation team to determine why the collision occurred.</p>
<p>The conditions for flying at the time of the crash were &#8220;­extremely difficult&#8221; because it was a dark night with no ­moonlight, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pilots work with night vision binoculars that intensify the residual light when there is no moon, no sources of artificial light like in cities, as is the case in this region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbry said the soldiers&#8217; bodies will be repatriated to the French mainland.</p>

<p>Thirteen soldiers from France&#8217;s Barkhane force in Mali were killed when two helicopters collided during an operation against jihadists in the country&#8217;s north, the Elysee said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The accident occurred on Monday evening while the forces were engaging the fighters who have staged a series of deadly strikes in northern Mali in recent weeks, French President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a>&#8216;s office said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The president hails with the greatest respect the memory of these soldiers&#8230; who lost their lives in an operation and died for France in the hard fight against terrorism in the Sahel,&#8221; it added in a statement.</p>
<p>Six officers and a master corporal were among the victims in the deadliest accident since France intervened in Mali in 2013 to drive back an intense Islamic insurgency. The accident brings to 38 the number of French soldiers killed in Mali since the intervention began.</p>
<p>France has around 4,500 troops in the country as part of its Barkhane operation, which is primarily tasked with building up and training local security forces but also participates in operations against the insurgents.</p>
<p>An inquiry has been opened into the cause of the midair collision, French ­Defense Minister Florence Parly said in a separate statement.</p>
<p>Defense ministry sources said a Tiger attack helicopter collided with a larger Cougar military transport helicopter.</p>
<p>It was the heaviest loss for the French army since the 1983 attack on the Drakkar building in Beirut, Lebanon in which 58 paratroopers were killed.</p>
<p>Mali has sustained a wave of insurgency strikes on army outposts and ­other targets, with more than 50 killed over just a few days in early November.</p>
<p>It is one of the countries in the Sahel region of Africa that has been caught in the eye of the jihadist storm since 2012, along with Niger, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands have rallied across the world to mark the ­International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, as France unveiled new measures to combat domestic violence.</p>
<p>Demonstrators on Monday gathered in countries as diverse as Guatemala, Russia, Sudan and Turkey, where riot police in Istanbul blocked the path of roughly 2,000 protesters before firing tear gas and plastic bullets to disperse them.</p>
<p>The French government announced it would make it easier for doctors to share information on vulnerable women and write into law the concept of psychological &#8220;entrapment,&#8221; following massive rallies in France over the weekend.</p>
<p>Roughly 87,000 women and girls were murdered across the world in 2017, according to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s rallies &#8211; animated by growing anger over the failure of justice systems to punish offenders &#8211; follow a weekend of protests against what is being termed femicide.</p>
<p>Crowds marched through the streets of Moscow to highlight the government&#8217;s failure to pass laws protecting women, and hundreds of Sudanese women chanted &#8220;freedom, peace and justice&#8221; as they ­gathered in Khartoum in the first such protest in decades.</p>
<p>In Mexico City, masked demonstrators with sledgehammers smashed glass panes of bus stops, spray-painted monuments and clashed with riot police Monday to protest authorities&#8217; failure to halt soaring rates of femicide and rape in the country.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched in Madrid on Monday evening following a weekend of protests. Spain&#8217;s long-standing laws against gender violence have not halted the problem &#8211; 52 women have been killed by their partners or ex-partners since the start of 2019.</p>
<p>South Africa has one of the worst records of any country on gender violence and the ­government has faced several rounds of mass protests on the issue.</p>
<p>South African ­President ­Cyril Ramaphosa used ­Monday&#8217;s events to launch a campaign to improve victims&#8217; access to justice and urge men to drop their &#8220;sexist and ­patriarchal attitudes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UN warned that more action was needed around the world, singling out Afghanistan as a country where too little is done to counter sexual violence and rape.</p>
<p>And in a rare move, global police cooperation agency Interpol launched an international appeal to find eight men suspected of murdering or committing violence against women.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Some Vietnamese workers gather at Honghe, Southwest China&#8217;s Yunnan Province in March 2018. Photos: VCG</p>
<p>As the tragic Essex truck deaths in the UK drew global attention to Vietnamese stowaway groups, illegal border-crossing from Vietnam to China, a problem which was frequently unveiled since 2000 but has been largely resolved through joint efforts from both countries, has once again sparked discussion in the Chinese media.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese smugglers tried to sneak into South China&#8217;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and then to Guangdong Province where low-skilled workers were needed at the time.</p>
<p>Dongxing and Pingxiang, two cities located on the border between China and Vietnam, are seen as the main channels for Vietnamese illegal workers to enter China to seek their &#8220;Chinese dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>During that time, almost every day along the China-Vietnam border line in Guangxi, Vietnamese entered China through unguarded paths, media reported. They then poured into factories in Guangdong and Fujian provinces by coach and train, filling in the gap of the labor shortage in China&#8217;s coastal regions, the Economic Observer, a Chinese newspaper, reported in 2010.</p>
<p>In 2012 alone, the Guangxi border authority seized 3,592 illegal immigrants from Vietnam, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
<p>The number of Vietnamese stowaways to China has slumped as the Chinese government tightened border regulations and cracked down on the human trafficking networks, officials from the Dongxing government told the Global Times.</p>
<p>China has also actively promoted cross-border labor cooperation with Vietnam in recent years, trying to offer a legal way for Vietnamese people to work in China and help them increase their incomes.</p>
<p>For young Vietnamese, working in China is becoming a safer choice and a promising future plan, according to some Vietnamese people reached by the Global Times.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Influx of workers</span></strong></p>
<p>More than a decade ago, in the Chinese border city Pingxiang, many small groups of Vietnamese often made their way back and forth through unguarded mountain trails near the entry port. Thousands of people traveled across border every day, the Economic Observer reported.</p>
<p>The influx of illegal workers from Vietnam brought multiple challenges to China&#8217;s social security and border management, according to Xinhua.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s labor shortage was the driving reason why Vietnamese workers entered the country. The number of illegal Vietnam workers reaches its peak during December to April every year during the sugarcane harvest season in Guangxi. There is a similar labor shortage prevailing in coastal cities where hard-working, low-wage workers are needed.</p>
<p>In June 2013, Le Thi Dung and 16 of her fellow villagers entered Dongxing, Guangxi, across the Beilun River, the border river between China and Vietnam. Le Thi Dung comes from a poor village in Central Vietnam&#8217;s Ha Tinh Province. It is her dream to earn a living in China. But their &#8220;Chinese gold rush dream&#8221; was shattered when they were seized by border police on the second day after they illegally entered China.</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-11-12/e9ca1359-1131-40b1-b77c-a7339395046a.jpeg"><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Vietnamese employees work in a factory of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Photos: VCG</p>
<p>Le Thi Dung was told that she can make 2,500 yuan ($358) a month working in China, a great temptation for the girl who only earns less than 400 yuan a month in Vietnam. She then paid 1,482 yuan to smugglers to take the risk, Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some Chinese factories pay &#8216;snakeheads&#8217; to find cheap Vietnamese labor. &#8216;Snakeheads&#8217; use their Vietnamese contacts to find workers, lure them with high salaries, and then smuggle them across the border to work in factories in southern China,&#8221; an official at the Fangchenggang Frontier Defense Police Station was quoted as saying by Xinhua.</p>
<p>&#8220;The smugglers are generally familiar with the border situation between China and Vietnam. They often take advantage of the all around trails in the border area to bypass the border checkpoints and sneak around at night, making it more difficult for border authorities to crack down,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In response to the illegal entry of Vietnamese workers, China&#8217;s border authorities have taken many recent measures, including strengthening inspection at border checkpoints and implementing the 24-hour duty system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The smuggling of Vietnamese into China was indeed rampant before 2015. But 2015 was a watershed year, as China and Vietnam cooperated to allow Vietnamese border residents to enter China&#8217;s border areas to work legally with valid documents,&#8221; Gu Xiaosong, an expert on Southeast Asian studies at the Guangxi Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. &#8220;In this way, more Vietnamese workers are able work in China through legal channels, and their interests are protected as well.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Legal stay</span></strong></p>
<p>Every morning, when the Dongxing port that connects China and Vietnam opens, Vietnamese workers with legal work permits line up at the port to cross the Beilun river bridge to start their day&#8217;s work in China.</p>
<p>Vietnamese border residents can enter China with their border permit, and the whole process takes as little as 10 minutes, said Zhu Guangbao, the head of human resources and social security administration in Dongxing.</p>
<p>Since July 2015, China and Vietnam have cooperated to launch the pilot project of cross-border labor service in Dongxing, allowing Vietnamese workers to enter designated areas in China&#8217;s border cities legally.</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="http://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-11-12/052fedf4-9e91-4cc1-86b1-2db15d6627c8.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Global Times</p>
<p>Zhu told the Global Times that there are around 10,000 Vietnamese workers in Dongxing, among whom 2,000 to 3,000 have a legal working permit. Most of them travel back and forth on the same day, earning money in temporary jobs such as cargo handling. These workers are mostly between 16 and 40 years old, and most of them are women.</p>
<p>Nguyen Thi Ngoc, from Mong Cai in Vietnam, came to China and became a worker in a local printing house five years ago. She was soon promoted to be a manager due to her diligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vietnamese people like to go out to work in Japan and Singapore before, but now they are more yearning for China. I choose to work in China because of a more stable income and complete welfare,&#8221; she told the Global Times. Before she came to China, she earned just over 700 yuan a month, but now her monthly income reaches 2,500 yuan, and she enjoys free food and accommodation. She is studying Chinese and hopes to gain an edge among her Vietnamese counterparts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Around 60 percent of the employees in my factory are from Vietnam, and most of them come here through referrals from old factory employees. If their technique is good enough, they can earn 10,000 yuan a month. We will also buy industrial accident insurance for Vietnamese workers,&#8221; Peng Hailong, an owner of a redwood mill factory in border city Pingxiang, told the Global Times. &#8220;At least 40 percent of Chinese companies in Pingxiang employ Vietnamese workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the border cities in Guangxi, it is common to see young and fashionable Vietnamese women workers as many local shop owners love to hire one or more young Vietnamese women as shop promoters. They can speak fluent Putonghua with a Vietnamese accent to attract visitors, a Guangxi merchandiser told the Global Times.</p>
<p>More young and educated Vietnamese people are moving from factories to global companies in office buildings around China, Zhu told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Zhu said that Dongxing government departments have spoken with Vietnamese authorities and hope to extend the legal stay of Vietnamese workers from 30 days to 180 days, encouraging them to work steadily.</p>
<p>Chinese border and public security authorities are meeting with their Vietnamese counterparts every year to discuss measures to combat illegal entry, stay and employment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2018, some Chinese border cities have started to issue business licenses to Vietnamese private companies in China to attract more Vietnamese workers, Zhu told the Global Times. </p>

<p>There has been a growing trend of people in Kyrgyzstan studying Chinese in recent years, and Kasymova Aiperi Kubatbekovna, a 26-year-old teacher at the Confucius Institute in Bishkek Humanities University, has witnessed it first-hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative has created many jobs in Kyrgyzstan, and young people who study Chinese can have more employment choices,&#8221; Aiperi told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aiperi spent four years studying Chinese in several cities in China from 2012, including Harbin in Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province and Wuhan in Central China&#8217;s Hubei Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During her stay in China, she visited many cities, her favorite being Shanghai, as it is &#8220;modern and prosperous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aiperi teaches Chinese at the Confucius Institute. She said that in addition to correcting students&#8217; pronunciation and teaching them ways to remember Chinese characters, she also answers many questions about every aspect of China from them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s rapid development has prompted many people in Kyrgyzstan to learn Chinese in recent years, with the aim of studying in China or finding a job in a Chinese company.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Rising trend</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;Four Confucius Institutes and 21 Confucius Classrooms are operating in Kyrgyzstan, and more than 7,000 students are studying at Confucius Institutes,&#8221; Zhang Shicai, dean of the Confucius Institute at Bishkek Humanities University, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>As a former Soviet republic in Central Asia, Kyrgyz and Russian are official languages in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Chinese has become a popular foreign language learned by more students,&#8221; Zhang said, noting that the Confucius Institutes in Kyrgyzstan have launched free Chinese classes in many primary schools, middle schools and universities, and some of these schools have listed Chinese as a required course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhang explained that more students are taking the Chinese Proficiency Test in Kyrgyzstan, and they plan to hold 10 tests to meet rising demand.</p>
<p>In addition to the Confucius Institutes, middle schools that offer Chinese classes have also become more popular in Kyrgyzstan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping noted in a signed article, which was published in Kyrgyz media on June 11 before his visit to the Central Asian country last week, that the Bishkek No. 95 Middle School, built with Chinese assistance in 2017, has become the most popular school in the area.</p>
<p>The school has gained popularity among local students and parents since it was established in September 2017, Aigul Salikhovna, principal of the Bishkek No. 95 Middle School, told the Global Times in Bishkek.</p>
<p>&#8220;We offer different class hours in Chinese for students of different grades, for example, four classes a week for grade 8 to grade 10. We also give interesting classes on Chinese culture, including calligraphy classes, which are popular among students,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Aigul noted that the school has launched a partnership with the Northwest University in Xi&#8217;an, Northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province, and more exchanges will take place between teaching faculty and students in schools in China and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>The well-developed China-Kyrgyzstan ties and the progress of programs under the Belt and Road Initiative have brought many employment opportunities in Kyrgyzstan, which has encouraged many people in the Central Asian country to learn Chinese, experts said.</p>
<p>Students reached by the Global Times in Bishkek said that the monthly salary in a Chinese company in Bishkek could reach $500, while the average salary in Bishkek is about $200.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Deeper understanding</strong></span></p>
<p>While some of the students in Kyrgyzstan who learn Chinese are driven by a promising future, more are interested in China&#8217;s rapid development and its political system, according to teachers and students reached by the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Students usually ask me questions on almost every aspect of China, including its culture, Shaolin kungfu, and its political system,&#8221; Aiperi said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhang said that the increasing number of students learning Chinese and intense people-to-people exchanges in recent years have shortened the distance between the two peoples.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many students who have studied in China become fond of Chinese food, its culture and lifestyle. They told their experience of visiting Chinese cities to their friends and relatives in Kyrgyzstan, which help them get a better understanding of China,&#8221; Zhang said.</p>

<p></font></strong>Some people in Kyrgyzstan may have some misunderstandings of China, including China&#8217;s policies in Xinjiang. But students who have studied in China, especially those who have lived in Xinjiang, believe the current de-radicalization policies there are &#8220;good for enhancing the security situation,&#8221; Zhang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Students and their parents all said that Xinjiang is a very safe region,&#8221; Zhang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kyrgyz police dispersed anti-China protesters who gathered partly due to China&#8217;s policies in Xinjiang in the early part of this year, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of its anti-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts, the Xinjiang regional government has launched vocational training centers to help people who have been influenced by extremism and terrorism receive education on national laws and de-radicalization knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those very few people who attended the anti-China protests had little knowledge of what is really happening now. Their activities cannot represent the view of the Kyrgyz people,&#8221; Talasbek Mashrapov, dean of the Faculty of Oriental Studies and International Relations in Bishkek Humanities University, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Talasbek said that China&#8217;s policies against terrorism and extremism are its internal affairs and other countries have no right to interfere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s measures in Xinjiang to prevent extremism are also right. If China wants to realize its goal of stability and development, it would deal with its domestic affairs very well,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respecting China&#8217;s sovereignty on implementing anti-terrorism and de-radicalization measures has become a consensus in Kyrgyz society, experts and scholars in Kyrgyzstan reached by the Global Times said. They also noted that Kyrgyz society and many politicians also showed an increasing interest in the Chinese government&#8217;s governance experience recently.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Talasbek Mashrapov, dean of the Faculty of Oriental Studies and International Relations in Bishkek Humanities University, reads <em>Xi Jinping: The Governance of China</em> in his office. Photo: Liu Xin/GT</p>
<p>Talasbek has studied<br />
<em>Xi Jinping: The Governance of China</em> for many years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I first read the Russian edition of the book in 2015 and kept reading it all day long. All the answers to my questions on China, including how it managed to have such rapid development in recent years, could be found in the book,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of China&#8217;s governance experience can serve as a reference for politicians in Kyrgyzstan, especially on anti-corruption, which has become a major problem in Kyrgyzstan, Talasbek said, noting that &#8220;Kyrgyz officials should learn to understand the needs of the people and do their work from the grass-roots level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Kyrgyz edition of the first volume of<br />
<em>Xi Jinping: The Governance of China</em> was released at a ceremony at the presidential residence in Bishkek on June 9.</p>
<p>Talasbek recommended that all officials, scholars and people who are interested in China read the book.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Future cooperation</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese companies are widely involved in infrastructure construction in Kyrgyzstan. Many roads in Bishkek, which link landmark buildings built in the style of the former Soviet Union, have been built by Chinese companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talasbek seemed very confident in the future of China-Kyrgyzstan ties when speaking of the current well-developed people-to-people and trade exchanges.</p>
<p>&#8220;People in Kyrgyzstan are hoping to achieve joint development together with China, especially under the Belt and Road Initiative,&#8221; said Talasbek.</p>
<p>There have been more Chinese companies coming to Kyrgyzstan in recent years, helping with local infrastructure construction and boosting local employment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhuo Min owns a company which mainly produces steel structures and engages in construction work in Bishkek. The company has taken part in the construction of many buildings, including a major power station in the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of the employees in my company are local residents and many workers come to us for a job because of our good reputation,&#8221; Zhuo told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Zhuo&#8217;s businesses in Kyrgyzstan have boomed in recent years with the launch of many projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. He has built a new office building next to the factory, where there are rooms for local workers to rest, pray and shower.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must respect local people&#8217;s traditions and integrate into Kyrgyz society. Only by doing this can we have better development and also contribute to local society,&#8221; Zhuo said. </p>
