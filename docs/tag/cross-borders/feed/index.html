<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during the wrapping-up press conference of a two-day NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) defense ministers&#8217; meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Oct. 25, 2019. (Xinhua/Zheng Huansong)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The US is to cut its contribution to NATO&#8217;s operating budget, officials said on Thursday, with Germany increasing payments as the alliance tries to appease US President Donald Trump ahead of a summit next week.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly ­criticized European members for freeloading on the US, singling out Germany for lagging behind on an alliance commitment to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense.</p>
<p>While most of Trump&#8217;s anger has been focused on European national defense budgets, there has also been US grumbling about how much Washington contributes to NATO&#8217;s own running costs, and the 29-member alliance has now agreed to a change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the new formula, cost shares attributed to most European allies and Canada will go up, while the US share will come down,&#8221; a NATO official said.</p>
<p>The US currently pays 22.1 percent of the NATO budget &#8211; which totaled $2.5 billion in 2019 &#8211; and Germany 14.8 percent, under a formula based on each country&#8217;s gross national income. Under the new agreement, the US will cut its contribution to 16.35 percent of the total, Germany&#8217;s will rise to the same level and other allies will pay more.</p>
<p>Though the sums involved are small in military terms &#8211; the 29 alliance members spent a total of nearly $1 trillion on defense in 2018 &#8211; not all allies are happy with the move.</p>
<p>Diplomats say France has refused to go along with the new arrangement and will keep its contribution the same at 10.5 percent, arguing that the deal to change the figures was cooked up between Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel without properly consulting other allies.</p>

<p>The black boxes from two French military helicopters that collided in Mali killing 13 soldiers have been found, a French military spokesperson said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The crash occurred late Monday during an operation against jihadists in the Liptako region, near the borders with Burkina Faso and Niger. It was the heaviest single loss for the French military in nearly four decades.<br />
<center><br />
 &nbsp;<br />
</center>&#8220;The two black boxes from the helicopters have been recovered. They will be handed over to the relevant authorities to be analyzed,&#8221; the spokesperson, Colonel Frederic Barbry, told BFMTV.</p>
<p>Three helicopters and a squadron of Mirage jets arrived Monday to support ground troops pursuing Islamist extremists.</p>
<p>Shortly after troops engaged the insurgents, who fled on motorbikes and in a pickup truck, a Tiger attack helicopter collided with a Cougar military transport helicopter, killing all 13 onboard the two aircraft.</p>
<p>Barbry said no theory as to the cause of the crash is being ruled out, and it would be up to the investigation team to determine why the collision occurred.</p>
<p>The conditions for flying at the time of the crash were &#8220;­extremely difficult&#8221; because it was a dark night with no ­moonlight, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pilots work with night vision binoculars that intensify the residual light when there is no moon, no sources of artificial light like in cities, as is the case in this region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbry said the soldiers&#8217; bodies will be repatriated to the French mainland.</p>

<p>Thirteen soldiers from France&#8217;s Barkhane force in Mali were killed when two helicopters collided during an operation against jihadists in the country&#8217;s north, the Elysee said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The accident occurred on Monday evening while the forces were engaging the fighters who have staged a series of deadly strikes in northern Mali in recent weeks, French President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a>&#8216;s office said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The president hails with the greatest respect the memory of these soldiers&#8230; who lost their lives in an operation and died for France in the hard fight against terrorism in the Sahel,&#8221; it added in a statement.</p>
<p>Six officers and a master corporal were among the victims in the deadliest accident since France intervened in Mali in 2013 to drive back an intense Islamic insurgency. The accident brings to 38 the number of French soldiers killed in Mali since the intervention began.</p>
<p>France has around 4,500 troops in the country as part of its Barkhane operation, which is primarily tasked with building up and training local security forces but also participates in operations against the insurgents.</p>
<p>An inquiry has been opened into the cause of the midair collision, French ­Defense Minister Florence Parly said in a separate statement.</p>
<p>Defense ministry sources said a Tiger attack helicopter collided with a larger Cougar military transport helicopter.</p>
<p>It was the heaviest loss for the French army since the 1983 attack on the Drakkar building in Beirut, Lebanon in which 58 paratroopers were killed.</p>
<p>Mali has sustained a wave of insurgency strikes on army outposts and ­other targets, with more than 50 killed over just a few days in early November.</p>
<p>It is one of the countries in the Sahel region of Africa that has been caught in the eye of the jihadist storm since 2012, along with Niger, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands have rallied across the world to mark the ­International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, as France unveiled new measures to combat domestic violence.</p>
<p>Demonstrators on Monday gathered in countries as diverse as Guatemala, Russia, Sudan and Turkey, where riot police in Istanbul blocked the path of roughly 2,000 protesters before firing tear gas and plastic bullets to disperse them.</p>
<p>The French government announced it would make it easier for doctors to share information on vulnerable women and write into law the concept of psychological &#8220;entrapment,&#8221; following massive rallies in France over the weekend.</p>
<p>Roughly 87,000 women and girls were murdered across the world in 2017, according to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s rallies &#8211; animated by growing anger over the failure of justice systems to punish offenders &#8211; follow a weekend of protests against what is being termed femicide.</p>
<p>Crowds marched through the streets of Moscow to highlight the government&#8217;s failure to pass laws protecting women, and hundreds of Sudanese women chanted &#8220;freedom, peace and justice&#8221; as they ­gathered in Khartoum in the first such protest in decades.</p>
<p>In Mexico City, masked demonstrators with sledgehammers smashed glass panes of bus stops, spray-painted monuments and clashed with riot police Monday to protest authorities&#8217; failure to halt soaring rates of femicide and rape in the country.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched in Madrid on Monday evening following a weekend of protests. Spain&#8217;s long-standing laws against gender violence have not halted the problem &#8211; 52 women have been killed by their partners or ex-partners since the start of 2019.</p>
<p>South Africa has one of the worst records of any country on gender violence and the ­government has faced several rounds of mass protests on the issue.</p>
<p>South African ­President ­Cyril Ramaphosa used ­Monday&#8217;s events to launch a campaign to improve victims&#8217; access to justice and urge men to drop their &#8220;sexist and ­patriarchal attitudes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UN warned that more action was needed around the world, singling out Afghanistan as a country where too little is done to counter sexual violence and rape.</p>
<p>And in a rare move, global police cooperation agency Interpol launched an international appeal to find eight men suspected of murdering or committing violence against women.</p>
