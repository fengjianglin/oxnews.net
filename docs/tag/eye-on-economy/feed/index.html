<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Two smartphones connected to the 5G network (R) and the 4G network (L) respectively are shown for comparison by a Chinese mobile service provider at the 2019 Smart China Expo in southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing Municipality, Aug. 26, 2019. (Photo: Xinhua)</p>
<p>Why will China, not the US, become the world&#8217;s largest 5G market? It&#8217;s a crucial question, as the 5G sector will contribute $3 trillion to the global economy over the next 15 years, Minister of Science and Technology Wang Zhigang said Thursday. He forecast that China will become the biggest 5G market in the world by 2025.</p>
<p>Since 2015, China has reportedly outspent the US by $24 billion in 5G infrastructure. In the same period, according to media reports, the US built fewer than 30,000 new cell sites, while the corresponding number in China was more than 10 times higher. The race to deploy 5G has heated up, but the US so far doesn&#8217;t have many chances to take the lead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be easy to change that situation, because China has some key advantages. With a population of about 1.4 billion, China&#8217;s consumer market is on the rise. As a result, the growth of China&#8217;s consumption-oriented digital economy has created ample demand for faster mobile broadband.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many high-technology companies in China, Huawei included, have spent heavily on 5G research and development in past years. The country has an internal driving force of 5G technology development that draws on expanding digital consumption and the emergence of new business models such as e-commerce.</p>
<p>Chinese authorities have made the development of cutting-edge technologies an economic priority, cutting red tape and reducing costs to stimulate the economy. The Chinese government is highly capable of mobilizing resources and coordinating action to promote economic development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An indigenous economic development model has been formed in China. Although Western media outlets always criticize the model, it is undeniably efficient.</p>
<p>The situation in the US is very different. Several Western media reports have suggested that US 5G development will lag because of partisan strife and defects in the US political system. The US is still uncertain how to expand broadband service in rural areas and the nation&#8217;s telecom infrastructure is desperately in need of investment. All those factors will obstruct US 5G development while promoting the same process in China.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A citizen counts the US dollars in Houma City, north China&#8217;s Shanxi Province, Oct. 11, 2011. The Chinese currency renminbi, or the yuan, strengthened 103 basis points to a record high of 6.3483 against the US dollar on Tuesday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trading system.Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Brazilian mining giant Vale has signed a contract with a Chinese steel enterprise based on iron ore futures at the Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE), according to the exchange&#8217;s website. Vale is the first overseas miner to diversify its iron ore sales based on yuan-denominated futures pricing, the DCE said.</p>
<p>Pricing power is usually in the hands of Western countries. That&#8217;s not a good situation, and it has to change to ensure China&#8217;s resource security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Economic growth has led to surges in China&#8217;s need for many imported commodities, and its rise as an important buyer of these products means that its influence on iron ore prices is projected to expand even more.</p>
<p>Some behemoths in the global mining industry have begun to sell iron ore denominated in yuan. The yuan-denominated contract is the first step in gaining pricing power in commodities. Some statistics show that China was the world largest importer of iron ore in 2018, accounting for a 65 percent share of global iron ore imports by value. If half of those iron ore deals were made and settled in yuan, it would add up to a huge figure in trade settlements. The time has come, and China should spare no effort to promote yuan-denominated cross-border trade settlements.</p>
<p>This means China must deepen financial reforms to allow the free flow of capital and offer effective risk management tools for cross-border settlements involving the yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DCE announced in August that it was working to speed up iron ore options and optimizing relevant rules, according to the Xinhua News Agency. China&#8217;s reforms continue while the authorities maximize their efforts to prevent systemic risks.</p>
<p>Uncertainty surrounding the China-US trade war is hitting bilateral ties. At this critical moment, more Chinese people feel the urgency of de-dollarization for the trading of strategic commodities like iron ore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boosting global use of the yuan will help ensure China&#8217;s energy security amid the trade war.</p>
<p>The global market has welcomed more cross-border yuan settlements. China should take advantage of the trend to promote use of the yuan and challenge the US dollar&#8217;s hegemony.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: Alibaba Group</p>
<p>E-commerce giant Alibaba is making headlines again, this time in the Washington Post, which asks &#8220;Why now, and why Hong Kong, for Alibaba&#8217;s share sale?&#8221; The newspaper asks a good question, but it doesn&#8217;t offer a good answer.</p>
<p>The Post said one reason why Alibaba chose Hong Kong for a share offering is that a blockbuster debut would show its confidence in Hong Kong&#8217;s future at a difficult time for the city, and thus earn Alibaba goodwill at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the newspaper may be reading too much into the Hong Kong share offering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listing shares in Hong Kong takes time, so Alibaba must have started considering the plan long ago, before Hong Kong was hit by radical rioters. Alibaba is an international enterprise, so there&#8217;s not much reason for it to get involved in the worrisome chaos in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The main reason for the Hong Kong listing may be that the Chinese e-commerce giant wants to find alternative sources other than the US market to raise new funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So will Alibaba leave the US behind? The answer is no. The US is the world&#8217;s largest economy and plays a powerful role in the financial arena. As an international company, Alibaba cannot abandon the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the e-commerce giant has to diversify its financing sources amid the trade war to reduce its dependence on the US. It&#8217;s to be expected to see the company ramp up efforts to ensure financial security as the trade war continues.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong listing can be seen as a bellwether. The trade war that the US launched has resulted in a reorganization of global industrial chains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one wants to see China&#8217;s economy decouple from that of the US, but some enterprises have begun to adjust their business strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Alibaba&#8217;s Hong Kong listing does deserve attention as a window to observe the impact of the trade war on the economic links between China and the US.</p>
<p>The US is still the world&#8217;s financial superpower. But if Washington weaponizes American economic and market power to crack down on Chinese mainland-based companies amid the trade war, the US will see more cases like Alibaba&#8217;s Hong Kong listing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Mobile photo shows the Wangfujing shopping street in Beijing, capital of China, July 25, 2019. (Xinhua/Zhu Weixi) </p>
<p>Chinese police recently destroyed a transnational industry chain that produced fake luxury bags bearing the labels of Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Chanel in Guangzhou, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province. These were sold in the domestic and overseas markets, with the amount involved in the cases put at 1.7 billion yuan ($242 million).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crackdown on making and selling fake luxury goods demonstrated China&#8217;s determination to protect intellectual property rights (IPR), which is one of the most problematic issues in talks with the US to end the ongoing trade war. China won&#8217;t offer the US side mere empty promises. Practical efforts have been made to enhance IPR protection in China.</p>
<p>If we put aside discussions about IPR temporarily and focus on the industry chain, the amount involved in the cases surprised us, because it was much higher than originally thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to imitate global luxury brands suggests that China has world-leading technology and manufacturing ability. Some imitations are even better than genuine ones in terms of quality. China&#8217;s manufacturing sector is advanced &#8211; the only thing missing is brand building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident offers a window on China&#8217;s manufacturing capabilities. China is the world&#8217;s factory, and it reportedly has the world&#8217;s largest industrial output. Chinese manufacturers run their businesses in a cost-effective way, and that allows them to offer affordable products to the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Made-in-China products have made a major contribution to reining in inflation in the global economy and benefiting low-income consumers. Chinese manufacturers can enable global consumers to enjoy cost-effective products that have the same high quality as luxury brands.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s advanced manufacturing ability makes it more urgent for China to crack down on the production and sale of fake luxury goods to protect IPR. Protection of IPR in China is improving and there are growing instances of crackdowns on IPR thieves.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s an urgent need for China&#8217;s manufacturing sector to focus more on brand building. Chinese businesses still lack awareness of that factor, and they lag behind in terms of global brand influence. It&#8217;s time to address that problem step by step, and the protection of IPR is one requirement in that effort.</p>

<p>There is a downturn in India&#8217;s economy, but will it become a protracted one? More specifically, will economic growth fall below 5 percent?</p>
<p>Credit rating agency Moody&#8217;s has slashed India&#8217;s GDP growth estimate to 5.6 percent for 2019. The GDP growth rate slipped to 5 percent year-on-year between April and June, the fifth consecutive quarter of deceleration. If the downward spiral in the economy continues, GDP growth will soon break below the 5-percent psychological barrier.</p>
<p>About a year ago, India was the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy, but now it faces a sharp slowdown. Why has the economy fallen off the cliff?</p>
<p>Initially, India&#8217;s economic expansion decelerated because of a decline in investment growth, but now the downward spiral is mainly being driven by slowdowns in consumption and manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A private survey showed expansion in the country&#8217;s manufacturing sector hit its slowest pace in 15 months in August. Some time ago, India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled an economic strategy aiming to turn India into a global manufacturing hub, but the slowdown suggests the &#8220;Make in India&#8221; campaign hasn&#8217;t been a success story.</p>
<p>Thus, growth in the Indian economy is likely to fall below the key level of 5 percent in the coming months, unless New Delhi draws up strong stimulus policies or carries out big economic reforms. The economy is edging closer to the alert line, but it seems New Delhi lacks awareness of the seriousness of the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent stimulus measures announced by the Indian government are deemed by many to be insufficient to reverse the economic slowdown, so there&#8217;s a high probability that GDP growth will continue to weaken.</p>
<p>The Modi administration has set many economic goals but given little attention as to how they are to be achieved. There are no clear indications that the Indian government has a strong stimulus plan to boost growth and stabilize the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of size alone, India has one of the world&#8217;s largest economies and is one of the biggest potential markets for many multinational companies. But if India&#8217;s GDP growth falls below 5 percent, the world economy may feel a chill. Chinese investors must prepare for the worst-case scenario if India&#8217;s economic problems continue to deteriorate.</p>

<p>Chinese telecom giant Huawei is the focal point for the ongoing trade row between China and the US. If the US side wants to end the trade war as soon as possible, Washington should immediately issue licenses allowing US companies to resume supplies to the Chinese giant.</p>
<p>To ease US concerns that Huawei may spy for Beijing and share user data with the Chinese government, Huawei Technologies USA Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy said earlier this week that testing mechanisms can be put in place to ensure security, CNBC reported. Huawei&#8217;s efforts should be answered by the US government, which claims to act as an advocate for a fair and transparent environment for foreign companies. This is a testing time of the credibility and reliability of the US government.</p>
<p>US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was quoted by CNBC as saying on November 3 that licenses for US companies to sell components to Huawei &#8220;are coming very shortly.&#8221; However, this is far from enough. The licenses should be issued immediately. More importantly, Huawei needs to be removed from the &#8220;US Entity List&#8221; of companies that are barred from buying US products.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that trade talks between China and the US have hit a bump over farm purchases. China can never make unilateral concessions. Any concessions by the Chinese side in terms of farm purchases need to be met with similar steps by the US side in other areas such as high-technology investment. Huawei is a test of Washington&#8217;s sincerity in giving fair treatment to China&#8217;s high-technology investment.</p>
<p>The negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between China and the US started in 2008 and significant progress had been made in 2013 when China agreed to conduct negotiations on the basis of a &#8220;negative list&#8221; approach. However, the US is still far behind in terms of solving problems inhibiting Chinese companies, especially those in high-tech industries, when they invest in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fair treatment of China&#8217;s technology investment in the US remains a sticking point in China-US economic ties. The US can no longer ignore China&#8217;s demands and must make a reasonable response to China&#8217;s core concerns. Offering licenses that would allow some US companies to supply goods to Huawei is something the US has to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wrestling match between the US and Europe over digital sovereignty reminds China to strengthen its own data security.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Europe to seize control of its data from Silicon Valley technology giants, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Wednesday. Merkel&#8217;s words show a growing awareness among European leaders of the need to challenge US dominance of the digital economy.</p>
<p>The digital economy, a new type of emerging economy that includes artificial intelligence, the digital sharing economy and various services, is changing every aspect of our daily lives. Whoever masters the digital economy will dominate the future economy. Global powers are competing with one another for a bigger presence in the new economy and the future digital trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>European economies have showed their intention to establish some institutional arrangements to ensure the stable and sound development of the digital economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take data, for example: Merkel was quoted by the FT as saying that the EU should develop its own platform to manage data and reduce its reliance on the US-based cloud services run by Amazon, Microsoft and Google.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This move reminds China to invest more resources to enhance its own digital capabilities.</p>
<p>China has witnessed exponential growth in its digital economy, with a surge of internet-related innovations and start-up activity. Now, the digital economy is equivalent to one-third of the country&#8217;s GDP. China needs to consolidate its position and establish its competitiveness in the global battle for new opportunities in the digital economy.</p>
<p>US financial hegemony can&#8217;t continue and can&#8217;t be endured in the digital age. One question worth considering is how to work with Europe to write the rules of the road for the digital economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese people firmly support a multilateral digital economic system. Ongoing efforts are needed to prevent US financial hegemony persisting amid the development of a global digital economy.</p>
<p>A key issue on the agenda of writing future digital economy rules is how to ensure data security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information will be the foundation of the digital economy. We support the freedom and openness of the internet, as well as efforts to prevent and remove digital trade barriers, but that doesn&#8217;t mean freedom in the virtual world has no boundaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merkel&#8217;s words remind us that data security is an issue related to a country&#8217;s &#8220;digital sovereignty.&#8221; China needs to keep thinking about how it will safeguard its digital sovereignty as its digital economy expands rapidly.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A breeder sprays disinfectant in a pig farm in Guang&#8217;an, Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province on Tuesday. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>A shortage of pigs in China is changing the very structure of the pork chain outside the nation and reshaping global meat markets, financial information website Marketwatch.com reported, citing a study commissioned by the US National Pork Board. We agree with this view. Soaring pork prices in China may exert an effect on the global economy.</p>
<p>African swine fever, a viral disease deadly to pigs but harmless to human beings, attracted limited public attention until it ravaged China&#8217;s hog herd. The study shows that the outside world is paying close attention to the Chinese consumer market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a population of about 1.4 billion, China is the world&#8217;s largest consumer and importer of pork. The nation&#8217;s pork imports in September surged 76 percent from a year earlier, according to Chinese customs data. The impact will be felt elsewhere in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A jump in China&#8217;s pork imports has set off a global chain reaction. Take Brazil, for example: The South American country&#8217;s pork exports to China have soared 40 percent since the beginning of the year, while its domestic pork prices have risen some 30 percent, according to Marketwatch. If China sneezes, will the rest of the world catch a cold? Many people already have their answer.</p>
<p>It is easy to feel the influence of China&#8217;s pork price fluctuations. Why? That&#8217;s because China&#8217;s consumption of meat has increased tremendously as its economy has boomed. According to some statistics, half the world&#8217;s pork is consumed in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a growing army of middle-class households, China&#8217;s consumption power keeps growing. The current discussion about pigs offers a window on China&#8217;s future consumption influence on the global economy.</p>
<p>Pork is only part of the story. What about other farm goods and consumer products? Many admit that China is now powerful enough to influence US agricultural production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As China continues to open up its domestic market to the outside world, China&#8217;s imports will further expand. An optimistic estimate is that China may overtake the US to become the world&#8217;s largest importer in the coming decade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is making a fundamental transformation from being the world&#8217;s factory to the king of world consumption, and the story of pork is just an early chapter.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Statues outside the building of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange File photo: IC</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s Singles&#8217; Day turned out to be an amalgamation of fire and ice in the world&#8217;s top internet market, with a chilly fall in the stock market contrasting with record-smashing online sales.</p>
<p>Why did the e-commerce fervor, arguably an indication of Chinese consumers&#8217; rising spending power, fail to create positive ripple effects in the stock market?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online retailers set new sales records on Singles&#8217; Day, also referred to as Double 11, with transactions on Alibaba&#8217;s Tmall totaling 268.4 billion yuan ($38.3 billion), well above the full-day figure of 213.5 billion yuan in the prior year. Orders made on JD.com also hit a new high of more than 200 billion yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inversely, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.83 percent to finish narrowly above 2,900 points on Monday, with over 90 percent of the 3,700-plus listings ending lower.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stock losses across the board might seem unfathomable. After all, few wanted the super discounts on Double 11 to spread to the stock market.</p>
<p>To start with, new policy announcements after the closing bell on Friday, notably the easing of refinancing rules for firms listed on the ChiNext board, will supposedly reduce barriers for funds to be raised through the equity market in hopes of shoring up the real economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these appear to have dented investor sentiment in the short run, as easier access to capital for companies actually puts the market under greater pressure amid sluggish liquidity and trading activity. Failing to rise above the key resistance level of 3,000 points after multiple attempts has already been a psychological setback for investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the consumer price index for October was on Saturday revealed to have recorded a new, more than seven-year high, fueled by soaring pork prices. The consumer inflation, expected to continue upward in the months to come, poses a dilemma for monetary policymaking, dampening easing hopes.</p>
<p>Among other factors considered to be contributing to a risk-off environment is US President Donald Trump&#8217;s Friday denial of agreeing to rollbacks of US tariffs on Chinese goods, which has sparked fresh doubts about the signing of the Phase One trade deal. Additionally, traders were jittery amid escalating unrest in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Index logging a loss of over 700 points on Monday.</p>
<p>Hence, the stock market opening to a poor start this week should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>E-commerce and courier services stocks were also badly battered on Double 11. Stocks normally rise based on expectations for future thrills, and the arrival of Singles&#8217; Day suggested it was time to liquidate rather than &#8220;shop.&#8221; Therefore, shopping-related stocks had risen well ahead of the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, a partial recovery in the stock market on Tuesday could help in soothing the pain for investors whose purses might have suffered a double whammy on Double 11.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Employees of an e-commerce company in the Changxing economic development zone, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, pack products Friday, several hours before Singles&#8217; Day.

<p>China&#8217;s annual online shopping spree, Singles&#8217; Day, is expected to break sales records once again despite the nation&#8217;s slowing economy. Who will be the biggest winner of this year&#8217;s shopping blitz: e-commerce platforms, Chinese manufacturers, or global exporters that target the Chinese market?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although more foreign brands have gotten involved in the event, many of them are still wary about pouring too much money into it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a strange thing. Singles&#8217; Day, also known as Double 11, constantly sets new sales records even though its true attraction is declining for some domestic and foreign brands. A possible reason is that the shopping spree encourages a competition to offer the lowest prices. If the makers of high-quality products refuse to cut prices, they are unlikely to gain much attention on Singles&#8217; Day.</p>
<p>Year after year, online retailers post new<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/952221.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singles&#8217; Day sales</a> records. The shopping spree has become an economic miracle in the past decade. But after the dust settles, price competition leaves a dent in Singles&#8217; Day results. The bonanza cannot become an engine for consumption and real economic growth if it&#8217;s just a time to tout the biggest discounts.</p>
<p>Many Singles&#8217; Day shoppers delay some of their planned purchases until the shopping spree, and that means there&#8217;s no significant increase in total consumption. In recent years, many online retailers have resorted to price competition to attract more customers on the big day. Maybe it&#8217;s time for a change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is one of the world&#8217;s largest markets for high-end consumer goods. According to a China luxury market study released by Bain &amp; Company in March, Chinese consumers buy one-third of the world&#8217;s luxury goods. The country&#8217;s consumption upgrading has increased its demand for luxury goods. However, low-price competition has made Singles&#8217; Day less attractive for luxury brands, which win consumers based on reputation rather than discounts. If Singles&#8217; Day only targets middle- to low-end products instead of the luxury market, its growth is unlikely to be sustainable.</p>
<p>Western brands are especially good at high-end production instead of labor-intensive goods. If Alibaba looks beyond China&#8217;s borders to turn Singles&#8217; Day shopping spree into a global phenomenon, it will encounter difficulties sooner or later due to the low-price competition model of doing business. Alibaba may need to rethink its Singles&#8217; Day model to avoid becoming a battleground of bargains.</p>
