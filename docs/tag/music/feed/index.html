<p>&#8220;Happy 19th birthday, and hope you are happy every day!&#8221; Roy Wang (Wang Yuan), a member of Chinese boy band TFBoys, sent out birthday wishes exactly at midnight on Thursday on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below the text was a photo of Jackson Yee, who is also part of the three-member boy band. In the picture, the smiling Yee holds a photoshopped cake in his hand, apparently, the work of Wang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four minutes later, Karry Wang (Wang Junkai), another member of the band, posted, &#8220;Happy 19th birthday, hope every day in the future goes well and is filled with happiness. Hope you can do more things that you love.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his post, Karry Wang attached a photo of Yee enjoying hot pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the same thread, Karry Wang later posted, &#8220;Due to a delay in the network in Switzerland, I failed to send out birthday wishes right on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wang&#8217;s birthday wishes drew Chinese netizen&#8217;s attention. Related hashtags have earned 320 million views and 61,000 posts in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debuting in 2013, the three have been working together for about six years. As the trio have transformed from ordinary teens to China&#8217;s most influential stars, they have appeared less frequently on stage together as they have gradually shifted focus to their individual careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wang is currently studying music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, while Karry Wang is attending the Beijing Film Academy. As for Yee, who is studying at the Central Academy of Drama, he recently gained huge success with his first film role in the coming-of-age drama<br />
<em>Better Days</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Chinese fans also sent out their own birthday wishes, they were warmed by the trio&#8217;s display of friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The relationship among the three &#8211; Karry Wang, Roy Wang and Jackson Yee &#8211; is a kind of brotherhood. They are still so close to each other!&#8221; one netizen wrote in a post on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>The Mariinsky Orchestra, one of the oldest orchestras in Russia, is performing at the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA) with Valery Gergiev from Monday to Wednesday.</p>
<p>Over the three days, the Russian music ensemble will perform a selection of music from Rimsky Korsakov&#8217;s opera<br />

<em>Parsifal</em> by Wagner and Symphonie Fantastique and Act V from the opera<br />
<em>Les Troyens</em>, both works of French musician Berlioz.</p>
<p>Valery Gergiev came to direct the orchestra in 1988. Since then, the orchestra&#8217;s repertoire has expanded significantly to also include symphonic works and other genres of philharmonic music.</p>
<p>Tickets for the show are now available on the official site of the NCPA and range from 100 yuan ($14) to 880 yuan.</p>

<p>The Symphony Orchestra of the Central Conservatory of Music (CCOM) of Beijing will make its US debut on December 13 at New York City&#8217;s Carnegie Hall with a feast of modern Chinese music by master composers and performers.</p>
<p>The concert will present works composed by eight of China&#8217;s most distinguished living composers, including<br />
<em>Sleeve Dagger</em><br />
<em>and Warriors</em>,<br />
<em>Pipa Concerto</em> by Chen Danbu,<br />
<em>Listen to the Sounds of Nature</em> by Jia Guoping and<br />
<em>Black Light</em> by Chang Ping.</p>
<p>Internationally acclaimed musicians, including bamboo flute players Fan Linfeng and Dai Ya and pipa player Zhang Qiang, will perform as soloists at the concert.</p>
<p>Yu Feng, director of the orchestra who also serves as president of the CCOM, will conduct the concert in his Carnegie Hall debut.</p>
<p>Yu, who has given master classes at leading conservatories across the world, has collaborated with many orchestras at home and abroad, including the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, Gulbenkian Orchestra in Portugal.</p>
<p>Established in 2016, the CCOM Symphony Orchestra is composed of outstanding professional musicians from China and abroad with exquisite playing skills who share a passion for performing classic works of diverse origins. It has performed more than 100 concerts for music lovers worldwide.</p>
<p>The concert is presented by MidAmerica Productions (MAP), an independent producer of choral concerts at Carnegie Hall which will kick off MAP&#8217;s 37th annual concert season.</p>
<p>Peter Tiboris, MAP&#8217;s general director and music director, conducted the CCOM Symphony Orchestra on a visit to China earlier this year. He said, &#8220;The Central Conservatory is the best of its kind in China, and compares favorably with its counterparts around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore, the composers represent the best of the best in China; this is some of the most interesting music being written today. Each work on the program will offer a unique perspective on how the modern symphony orchestra can express a Chinese sensibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>Escalating unrest in Hong Kong has further outraged Chinese netizens after several concerts and festivals scheduled in the city were canceled over safety concerns, including dates by local favorite Eason Chan and the Clockenflap annual music festival, which always attracts a raft of top international acts to the city.</p>
<p>Famous Hong Kong singer Eason Chan announced on Thursday on Chinese Twitter-like Sina Weibo and Facebook that a series of 25 concerts scheduled from December 9 to January 7 in Hong Kong, is canceled &#8220;in view of recent happenings&#8221; and because they &#8220;cannot predict and promise the safety of audience and the traffic conditionsâ€¦,&#8221; read the announcement.</p>
<p>The cancelation came two days after a gig by Taiwan pop singer Jay Chou in Hong Kong was postponed due to the similar reasons, which made a big splash on social media.</p>
<p>Chan&#8217;s fans posted that they understand and support the decision and welcomed Chan to perform in the Chinese mainland as personal safety has been a big problem recently in Hong Kong, a city which has suffered months of anti-government protests which often escalated into violence and vandalism.</p>
<p>Fans even threatened on social media that they will form a group and come to Hong Kong to &#8220;give those rioters a lesson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many fans expressed their outrage toward the violent Hong Kong protesters who have destroyed their long-expected meeting with the idol and wasted their money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent HK$1,600 yuan [$204] buying a ticket which should cost HK$980 from scalpers and now I can only get a partial refund, which means I lost HK$620,&#8221; a fan surnamed Li based in Hong Kong told the Global Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>Clockenflap, Hong Kong&#8217;s biggest annual music and arts festival, which was due to be held at the Central Harbourfront Event Space from November 22 to 24 was also cancelled. &#8220;Due to the escalation of the crisis this week, and therefore the uncertainty this creates for the coming weeks, Clockenflap 2019 will be canceled,&#8221; the organizer said on Facebook on November 15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netizens noted the cancelation by the unrest in the city not only caused losses to both organizers and fans in terms of time, efforts and costs, but also makes them concerned about the city&#8217;s future as an entertainment hub.</p>
<p>Observers said that as a melting pot of Eastern and Western cultures, Hong Kong is also considered a cultural center. However, the international metropolis has now descended into a culturally isolated island, said Tang Fei, a member of the Council of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies.</p>
<p>The city right now is not suitable to hold large-scale cultural activities, especially activities favored by young people, a small section of whom are not rational and go to extremes to threaten public security, said Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan at Nankai University</p>
<p>Media reported that a concert by K-pop boy band GOT7 in Hong Kong, part of their world tour, which was scheduled for August 31 and September 1 was postponed.</p>
<p>2020 Hong Kong Formula E-Prix, a motorsport championship, was canceled in October over protest fears.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Taylor Swift Photo: IC</p>
<p>Taylor Swift&#8217;s former label said Monday that it will allow the global pop superstar to perform some of her early hits at an awards show this month &#8211; the latest twist in a months-long public feud over the rights to her first six albums.</p>
<p>But even the seeming resolution of the spat did not come without some confusion.</p>
<p>The Big Machine Label Group released what it called a joint statement with Dick Clark Productions &#8211; which puts on the American Music Awards &#8211; saying they had &#8220;reached a licensing agreement&#8221; that would allow Swift to sing what she wants at the November 24 ceremony.</p>
<p>But shortly thereafter, the producers distanced themselves from the situation, saying it was between Swift and her ex-label.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Machine, which is based in Nashville, then clarified that it had &#8220;informed&#8221; the production company of its licensing approval.</p>
<p>Swift&#8217;s publicist did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment, and the pop star has yet to react publicly.</p>
<p>Last week, Swift &#8211; known for her calculating social media strategy &#8212; said on Tumblr that Big Machine heads were &#8220;exercising tyrannical control&#8221; over her.</p>
<p>She claimed they had told her she was &#8220;not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I&#8217;m allowed to next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pop superstar &#8211; famous for megahits like &#8220;Shake It Off&#8221; and &#8220;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together&#8221; &#8211; also said Big Machine was preventing her from using &#8220;older music or performance footage&#8221; for a Netflix project.</p>
<p>The company, which did not refer to the Netflix issue in its latest statements, denied the allegations last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media,&#8221; Big Machine said Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists&#8217; audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swift began publicly sparring with industry mogul Scooter Braun this summer over his purchase of her former label of more than a decade, which gave him a majority stake in the master recordings of her first six albums.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old then vowed to re-record her early albums to create copies she owns herself, saying her contract allows her to begin redoing albums one through five in November 2020 &#8211; when she plans to be back in the studio doing just that.</p>
<p>Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group in 2018 that gave her ownership of her masters going forward, including for her recently released seventh album<br />
<em>Lover</em>.</p>

<p>Kanye West is expanding his repertoire to include opera, premiering a new production entitled<br />
<i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> in Los Angeles on Sunday.</p>
<p>West tweeted art announcing the new production that will feature music from his Sunday Service choir over the weekend, as southern California&#8217;s Hollywood Bowl venue said tickets would go on sale Monday.</p>
<p>Exactly what the opera, which is directed by Italian performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, will depict is unclear, but the title suggests it will focus on the ancient Babylonian king it&#8217;s named for.</p>
<p>West had discussed Nebuchadnezzar in a wide-ranging interview with Apple music while promoting his recently released gospel album and Imax film,<br />
<i>Jesus Is King</i>.</p>
<p>The mercurial rapper, who in recent months has shed his myriad personas to reveal himself as a born-again weaver of gospel and rap, described how the ancient ruler had inspired him, saying they had both been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nebuchadnezzar was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and he was still king,&#8221; West said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;So not only was I diagnosed with mental illness, but mental illness was something that was used to&#8230; wash me out, to control me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bible does not explicitly mention &#8220;bipolar disorder,&#8221; a modern term, but the book of Daniel does describe Nebuchadnezzar as experiencing a period of mental instability and troubling dreams.</p>
<p>Some critics link West&#8217;s biblical shift to his tabloid-perfect outbursts, brush with politics and struggles with mental health in recent years.</p>
<p>The Grammy-winning performer has openly discussed his battle with bipolar disorder, telling talk show host David Letterman this year: &#8220;I feel a heightened connection with the universe when I&#8217;m ramping up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a sprained brain, like having a sprained ankle. And if someone has a sprained ankle, you&#8217;re not going to push on him more. With us, once our brain gets to a point of spraining, people do everything to make it worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>US performer will.i.am has accused a Qantas flight attendant of racism, saying she was unjustified in calling the police on him after an altercation during an Australian domestic flight.</p>
<p>In a series of tweets, the Black Eyed Peas frontman on Saturday said the woman was &#8220;overly aggressive&#8221; and unnecessarily escalated a situation after he didn&#8217;t hear an on-board safety briefing.</p>
<p>Using the hashtag #RacistFlightAttendant, William Adams &#8211; better known by his stage name will.i.am &#8211; said the attendant was &#8220;beyond rude&#8221; and &#8220;took it to the next level by calling the police,&#8221; five of whom were waiting for him on arrival in Sydney following the 90-minute flight from Brisbane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank god the other passengers testified that SHE was out of control,&#8221; he tweeted. &#8220;The police finally let me go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he had complied &#8220;quickly and politely&#8221; with her instructions to put his laptop away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to believe she racist. But she has clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Qantas spokesman said the Australian flag carrier &#8220;completely&#8221; rejected the suggestion that race was a factor in the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a misunderstanding on board, which seems to have been exacerbated by will.i.am wearing noise canceling headphones and not being able to hear instructions from crew,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be following up with will.i.am and wish him well for the rest of the tour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group ended a five-city Australia tour with a concert in Sydney on Saturday.</p>
<p>The incident came two months after the Australian twin-sister pop duo The Veronicas were removed from a Qantas flight.</p>

<p>The Popeye the Sailor Man and his girlfriend Olive Oyl are set to reunite on stage at the Beijing Tianqiao Performing Arts Center in December for the rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll musical Popeye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upcoming original musical follows the characters in the original US cartoon, but tells a very different story and explores plots such as the reason behind why Popeye becomes strong from eating spinach, said show director Li Zongxi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the music is the core part of the musical, Fan Chong, the artistic director said that they have written 14 original songs specially tailored for the stage work.&nbsp;</p>
