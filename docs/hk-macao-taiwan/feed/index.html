<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Students of Hou Kong Middle School participate in a flag-raising ceremony marking the Chinese Youth Day in south China&#8217;s Macao, May 4, 2018. (Xinhua/Cheong Kam Ka)</p>
<p>Every Monday morning, Macao&#8217;s Hou Kong Middle School holds a national flag-raising ceremony attended by all the teachers and the students.</p>
<p>The ceremony dates back to Oct. 1, 1949, when the school&#8217;s principal Du Nam raised the five-star red flag on the campus. The flag-raising ceremony has been held until today, which has become the common memory of all the teachers and students in Hou Kong Middle School.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the majority of primary and middle schools in Macao hold national flag-raising ceremonies every Monday morning. All schools, colleges and universities in Macao fly the national flags on important festivals.</p>
<p>National flag, national anthem and national emblem as a representative and symbol of the motherland are well known in Macao&#8217;s schools.</p>
<p>Macao has set up a series of laws and regulations to carry out education of national flag, national anthem and national emblem for students in schools.</p>
<p>According to the framework of curriculum for Macao&#8217;s schools by the government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), all of Macao students are required to know the national flag and national emblem, understand their basic meaning and sing the national anthem when at their primary schools.&nbsp;</p>

(Xinhua/Zhang Jinjia)</p>
<p>To implement those regulations, Macao&#8217;s education authorities have worked with institutions from the mainland to publish textbooks for Macao students.</p>
<p>For example, Virtue and Citizen, published by Education and Youth Affairs Bureau of Macao and People&#8217;s Education Press, a famous Chinese publisher, has been used for years in Macao&#8217;s primary and middle schools and accepted gradually by more and more students.</p>
<p>In addition, Macao&#8217;s junior and senior middle schools have set Chinese history as a course in class and use textbooks published by People&#8217;s Education Press.</p>
<p>In recent years, the education sector in Macao has also encouraged the students to read books about China, providing extracurricular reading books for primary and middle schools students, as well as some kindergartens.</p>
<p>Those extracurricular books were jointly published by well-known publishing houses from the mainland and Macao&#8217;s institutions, or provided through exchanges and cooperation with the mainland.</p>
<p>In 2018, China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/4.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Education</a> also gave such books to 77 schools in Macao as presents, 20 sets for each, including the books on Chinese history, the world history, and the Chinese culture such as ancient Chinese poetry and Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s education sector has always attached great importance to the promotion of traditional Chinese culture, and encourage the students to learn about the Chinese history and cultural traditions to have a broad perspective on their own country.</p>

<p>Many schools have extracurricular classes on traditional calligraphy, ancient poetry recitation, Chinese martial arts, Chinese ethnic instruments and other programs.</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s Kao Yip Middle School has set up compulsory calligraphy courses in its primary and middle sectors, which has become one of its characteristics. Students often win prizes in calligraphy competitions at various levels.</p>
<p>He Cheng, the principal of Kao Yip Middle School, said that the school has been providing calligraphy education for a long time, and has carried out a wide range of extracurricular calligraphy activities, to guide students to understand the Chinese cultural tradition, feel the charm of the Chinese language, and promote their interests in and understanding about their country.</p>
<p>In addition, the Macao SAR government and social organizations also support and encourage students to visit the mainland, learn about its social conditions, and experience Chinese history and culture by themselves.</p>
<p>Education and Youth Affairs Bureau of Macao and relevant ministries and institutions of central government have held many summer camps and travel programs for Macao students to know more about their country by paying visits to universities, museums and historical sites in the mainland.</p>
<p>The bureau also plans to increase funding for the &#8220;Know the Motherland Study Tour&#8221; to include teaching staff to study the Chinese history and culture, so that teachers and students together can learn about China&#8217;s modern history and development.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2016, the SAR government launched the One Thousand Talents program which targets middle schools, college and university students and young employees in Macao.</p>
<p>Each year, the program selects 1,000 youth to go to different provinces and cities in the mainland to carry out various learning and exchange activities. The theme of the activity covers fields such as history and culture, sports, scientific and technological innovation, youth entrepreneurship, as well as social work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Hongkongers hold a rally protesting &#8220;Hong Kong independence&#8221; and expressing their support for the National People&#8217;s Congress&#8217;s interpretation of the region&#8217;s Basic Law outside the Legislative Council in Hong Kong on November 13. Photo: CFP</p>
<p>A senior official of the Chinese government responsible for Hong Kong and Macao affairs published an article in the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CPC) pointing out that Hong Kong has neither passed the national security law nor established any institute for enforcement while Macao has already passed the law and improved a lot, and this is why separatist activities have been intensifying in Hong Kong in recent years. The People&#8217;s Daily on Wednesday published a long signed article on its page 9 by Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, headlined &#8220;Adhere to and improve the &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; institutional system&#8221; to comprehensively expound the correctness and feasibility of the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; in China.</p>
<p>The article reflected the study and implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee on the special administrative regions (SARs) issue, while it stressed that strengthening the implementation and improvement of the national security legislation and enforcement mechanism as well as strengthening the capability of law enforcement in Hong Kong is an urgent mission for the HKSAR government and different groups among the society.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Pedestrians cross a road in the Central district of Hong Kong in October. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Apart from national security, the article also touched many issues including how to integrate Hong Kong and Macao into the overall development of the country, how to ensure the central government&#8217;s authority in SARs that are authorized by the Constitution and the Basic Law, and expressed the need to establish an anti-foreign interference mechanism in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Chinese experts said that publishing such an article at this time while Hong Kong is still suffering turmoil and Macao is waiting for the upcoming celebration of the 20th anniversary of returning to China, is delivering a signal that China is reviewing its policies and principles on governing SARs and it is trying to clarify some misunderstanding as well as introducing solutions and plans to solve long-existing problems and newly emerged challenges.</p>
<p>Establishing and improving a legal system for safeguarding national security in the SARs and improving related enforcement mechanisms are natural and have their practical needs, said the article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Macao has completed the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, established the committee for safeguarding national security and its office, and has proactively added anti-separatism provisions to the Legislative Council&#8217;s election law. The next step is to formulate and modify relevant supporting legislations.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong has not yet completed the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law and has not set up a corresponding enforcement agency. This is one of the main reasons why the activities of local radical separatist forces such as &#8216;Hong Kong secessionists&#8217; have intensified in recent years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making a comparison between Macao and Hong Kong on this issue shows that the official of the central government wants to tell the people and officials of the two SARs what is right and what is wrong, said an anonymous Beijing-based Hong Kong and Macao studies expert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Macao is more secure and can focus on development rather than suffering from unrests, the national security law is a key reason. At least it can prevent foreign forces and anti-China separatists using discontent among the people to create and incite a massive political movement to hurt the city,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong to enact Article 23 of the Basic Law, but the Chief Executive could evoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to make regulations, which, however, would lead to a judicial review, Kennedy Wong Ying-ho, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s abnormal that Article 23 has not been enacted since Hong Kong has returned to China for over 20 years. If national security could not be fully safeguarded, it would be far away from the universal suffrage, Tang Fei, a member of the Council of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Hong Kong Photo: VCG</p>
<p>For the moment, the Public Order Ordinance, Societies Ordinance and Crimes Ordinance have certain interpretations concerning national security matters.</p>
<p>However, they are obviously not strong enough, Tang noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It requires more professional and much wider consultation on the matter,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no special full-time police department or prosecutors handling cases related to national security and it&#8217;s difficult for the police or department of justice to investigate and prosecute as soon as possible. Enactment of Article 23 has been delayed for years, the analyst said. &#8220;Because it&#8217;s under the Basic Law and in line with &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; principle, it&#8217;s reasonable to revive it despite of rising opposition of anti-government forces,&#8221; he added.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The press conference for the &#8220;Thunder 2019&#8221; special campaign jointly conducted by the police of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. Photo: China Police site </p>
<p>Police in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province and the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions finished a six-month campaign against cross border crime, apprehending 1,400 suspects and seizing 21 kilograms of drugs and 152 firearms. Experts said it shows the joint enforcement capability remains effective despite ongoing social unrest in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annual campaign lasted from July to December, according to a statement from China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/8.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Public Security</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two rounds of unified inspections were carried out during the period, in which the police investigated 17,700 entertainment venues and solved more than 1,000 criminal cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The police also intercepted 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) and HK$30,000 ($3,800) of illicit money, according to the statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tripartite police campaign shows that the joint governance mechanism in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area remains unaffected in spite of the Hong Kong unrest, Fan Peng, a researcher at the Institute of Political Science under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The enforcement capacity of the Hong Kong police can be demonstrated in the campaign, which shows that the months-long riots in Hong Kong have not affected the participation of Hong Kong police in the joint operation in the Greater Bay Area,&#8221; said Fan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of cross-border criminal gangs were tackled during the campaign. For example, police from Zhuhai, Guangdong cooperated with police in Macao in cracking two gangs and seizing more than 120 suspects in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In August, police from Shenzhen and Hong Kong also worked together in cracking down on a smuggling group, seizing 13 suspects and 58 stowaways and successfully cutting a smuggling route from Vietnam to Guangdong.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chairman of Hong Kong&#8217;s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) Anthony Neoh (second from right) at a press conference on Agust 23 to announce the establishment of an international expert panel to facilitate the council&#8217;s study on recent public order events Photo: Screenshot from IPCC website</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) on Wednesday denied its international experts &#8220;quit&#8221; as some Western media reported, saying they had stepped aside after finishing an interim report.</p>
<p>Anthony Neoh, IPCC chairman, told Hong Kong media on Wednesday that the international experts were not resigning. It was just they finished their current phase of work collecting evidence and drafting a report. They had showed interest to come back and help when the IPCC moves to the next phase, he said.</p>
<p>Tony Tse Wai-chuen, a lawmaker and IPCC vice-president, also said Wednesday the international experts did not resign but stepped aside after finishing this stage of their work, local media reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statements came after the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday published a report, quoting the panel as saying it &#8220;steps down from probe of Hong Kong police&#8221; as the city&#8217;s watchdog &#8220;lacks powers to properly investigate&#8221; use of force during police operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using &#8220;stepping down&#8221; to describe the panel&#8217;s normal working arrangement was just a typical trick of some Western media, according to Fan Peng, a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong &amp; Macao Studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The media was exploiting the public&#8217;s limited knowledge of the IPCC panel&#8217;s remit and creating the impression that the police watchdog was restricted from working properly.</p>
<p>The analyst pointed out that the international expert panel, hired by the IPCC, has its missions and working pace within the framework of laws and administrative regulations of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel helped assess the independence and use of force of Hong Kong police operations and was designed to be a consultative body rather than an instructor, Fan noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IPCC doesn&#8217;t have to embrace everything the panel comes up with,&#8221; Fan said.</p>
<p>He also noted if the panel has offered advice, they must pass judicial organs before taking any effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC announced to establish an international expert panel on August 23 and later on September 4 released a list of the five-member panel chaired by Dennis O&#8217;Connor, who had investigated police action during disturbances in Britain in 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the IPCC website, the overseas experts&#8217; role is to provide international experience and advice for the IPCC&#8217;s thematic study on police practices and procedures arising from recent public order events.</p>
<p>Ian Grenville Cross, Hong Kong&#8217;s former director of public prosecutions, told Wen Wei Po on Wednesday that the IPCC has many experienced experts who can do the work in accordance with mature internal procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The international experts were mainly polishing the report to make it in line with international standards, Cross said, adding the experts were not familiar with the situation in Hong Kong and did not play a decisive role in forming the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anthony Neoh on Saturday told media that the expert panel did not have a thorough understanding of the complicated situation in Hong Kong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I already told them their opinions are noted with thanks but we must act according to laws,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The council also included police watchdog experts from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and a British specialist on crowd behavior.</p>
<p>One of the council&#8217;s specialists, Clifford Stott, in early November posted a report on Twitter saying that the IPCC had structural limitations in the scope and power of the inquiry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC replied then that the document released was not an announcement of the panel, but the personal action of Stott without prior consultation with the IPCC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC was disappointed with the tweet, according to a statement by the police watchdog.</p>

<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s educational regulators announced on Wednesday that they have investigated more than 60 of 106 public complaints made from June to the start of November, of teachers suspected of glorifying the violence in the social unrest and insulting police, and are considering punishing teachers involved in 30 verified cases.</p>
<p>The Education Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region made the announcement on Wednesday at a press conference.</p>
<p>Kevin Yeung Yun-hung, the secretary of the bureau, told media that if misconduct is proven, it will consider necessary disciplinary actions, which include a warning, a reprimand or even de-registration if their offenses are very serious in nature, according to a transcript of remarks posted on the bureau&#8217;s official website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bureau said it has no comment on the number of teachers arrested due to legal procedures, Wen Wei Pao reported, and the bureau has asked the school to consider suspending a teacher arrested on Monday in Sheung Shui for alleged illegal assembly and possessing offensive weapons.</p>
<p>Global Times learned that 106 cases were all related to teachers&#8217; improper comments and teaching materials.</p>
<p>The bureau said among the 60 cases, two teachers who cursed and insulted police and their families on social media were involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wong Kwan-yu, the president of the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, said that teachers are not supposed to spread their political views in the classroom. However, some young teachers touched the red line by spreading comments and assigning homework designed to distort the truth of illegal protests and violence, which produced negative impact on the students.</p>
<p>Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at Tuesday&#8217;s press conference that the Hong Kong police have arrested more than 6,000 people since June 9. Among them, 2,393 or about 40 percent are students, and about 300 high schools in city were involved.</p>
<p>Considering the difficulty of getting evidence from classroom discussions, some investigation work is still needed, that&#8217;s why only 30 cases were verified so far, Wong noted.</p>
<p>Besides teachers, some high-tier officials should be blamed as well. According to Wong, legislators representing Hong Kong&#8217;s education authorities, as well as the city&#8217;s largest teachers&#8217; union, often hold a permissive attitude towards violence and hatred, using freedom of speech as an excuse.</p>
<p>Wong said that the bureau and government are too &#8220;polite,&#8221; and they should release more information of &#8220;problematic teachers&#8221; to the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan at Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times that the move of Hong Kong&#8217;s Education Bureau is of a tentative nature. If the public response is positive and supportive they will take a tougher stance against &#8220;problem teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Li noted collective efforts from society are needed to help students establish the correct values, and understand history correctly. Schools should be more active in positively influencing public opinions, and the government should take a tougher stance in supporting the education bureau.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lam slammed the violence and illegal activities in universities and asked the Secretary for Education to seriously follow up the case of a teacher, after he and 11 rioters were arrested for carrying flammable weapons and instruments for road blockage and vandalism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The months-long social unrest in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has affected local economic development while the liquidity in the banking system remains robust, HKSAR Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said at a forum on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Considering the capital inflows and outflows, the performance of the stock market, the free exchange of the Hong Kong dollar and its Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), Hong Kong&#8217;s banking industry is still seeing stable growth, Chan said, local media hkej.com reported.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed up 0.79 percent at 26,645.43 points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The impact on Hong Kong&#8217;s financial sector exerted by the social unrest, which has lasted nearly half a year, will take some time to emerge instead of becoming obvious immediately, Dong Shaopeng, an adviser for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dong said that the HKSAR government is able to deal with general fluctuations so far to keep local financial sector stable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An IMF Staff Mission on December 4 commended the resilience of Hong Kong&#8217;s financial system and the LERS despite a slowing economy, noting that a history of prudent macroeconomic policies has left Hong Kong with significant buffers to navigate through cyclical and structural challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><br />
 <img style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2019/2019-12-08/19bca7aa-474b-40e4-be1c-069dcebcd5d4.jpeg"><br />
</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo:VCG</p>
<p>These buffers include sizeable foreign exchange reserves, a large net international investment position, banks&#8217; strong capital and liquidity buffers at levels well above international standards and large fiscal reserves, the mission said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since October, IPOs on the Hong Kong market have resumed as investors showed confidence in sectors such as medical treatment and property management, Alex Zhao, an employee of a Hong Kong-based investment bank boutique, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>E-commerce giant Alibaba was listed in Hong Kong on November 26.</p>
<p>Most investors are still confident about the Hong Kong capital market because of their trust in the local legal system, the sound capital liquidity and predictions that the recent unrest will not shake&nbsp;the city&#8217;s position as a world financial center, Zhao said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the A-share market has embraced positive reforms, the Hong Kong capital market is still attractive to investors in the short term thanks to its relatively easier IPO rules and convenient methods of fundraising in US dollars,&#8221; Zhao noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if the chaos continues to dampen the city&#8217;s business environment, the local financial industry can hardly escape from a slowdown or capital outflows, Dong said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s high time for Hong Kong to guarantee a sound business environment through restoring public order,&#8221; Dong said.</p>
<p>The local government has recently introduced fiscal stimuli to support the economy, including support for small and medium-sized enterprises, further tax relief, extra social security payments and subsidies for households.</p>

<p>The Education Bureau (EDB) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has mulled punishing teachers for professional misconduct related to social unrest.</p>
<p>An EDB spokesperson said violations of teacher&#8217;s code of conduct were found in 30 of 106 cases the EDB has carried out investigations into since June this year.</p>
<p>As important role models for students, teachers&#8217; words and deeds must conform to the community&#8217;s moral and professional expectations, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The EDB&#8217;s move came amid rising concerns about teachers&#8217; role in prolonged social unrest and even violent incidents as an increasing number of students were involved in illegal activities in recent months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>About 40 percent of 6,022 people arrested for offenses including unlawful assembly, participation in riot and possession of offensive weapons since June were students, the police have said.</p>
<p>Of the 12 people arrested on Monday morning, six were students and one was a teacher. Police seized flammable liquid and glass bottles that could be used to make petrol bombs, as well as instruments for road blockage, including nails and homemade barricades.</p>
<p>The EDB has asked for the suspension of the teacher arrested on Monday, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added the EDB will follow up every case related to teachers, who, if convicted, may face cancellation of their registration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of Appeal lifted a mask ban on Tuesday by refusing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government&#8217;s request to suspend an earlier ruling by the High Court of HKSAR that found it &#8220;unconstitutional,&#8221; in a move which solicitors said is unhelpful to end violence and chaos which has rocked the city for six months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The High Court ruled the anti-mask law enforced by the city government to quell months-long radical protests was &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; on November 18, but the Court of Appeal set aside two days, January 9 and 10, for the appeal to be heard, Hong Kong media reported.</p>
<p>This means the anti-mask law has been lifted, but if the appeal succeeds in January, the law will be reinforced. &#8220;So before the appeal is heard, if the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC) issues an interpretation of the Basic Law, this would be very helpful for the appeal,&#8221; Kennedy Wong Ying-ho, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On November 19, after the High Court&#8217;s ruling, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the NPC expressed deep concern over the ruling related to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, saying that only the Standing Committee of the NPC can judge and decide whether Hong Kong laws are in line with the Basic Law.</p>
<p>Yang Guang, spokesperson of the State Council&#8217;s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, also said on November 19 that Hong Kong&#8217;s High Court ruling on anti-mask law is not in line with the Basic Law, posing a blatant challenge to the authority of the Standing Committee of the NPC and the chief executive of HKSAR, which will lead to negative consequences in social and political aspects.</p>
<p>Lifting the mask ban is unhelpful for the HKSAR government and the police to stop violence and chaos in Hong Kong, despite the central government and national leaders have expressed their support to the government, the police and judicial bodies of HKSAR to work together to restore public order, Wong noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, the facts that we see show that judicial bodies are not very cooperative to some extent,&#8221; Wong noted.</p>
<p>Acting High Court chief judge Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor and Court of Appeal vice-president Johnson Lam Man-hon on Tuesday said they were satisfied the government appeal was &#8220;reasonably arguable&#8221; but found that the authorities had failed to show a need to further suspend the lower court&#8217;s declaration of unconstitutionality and refused the application, the South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the judges also warned their decision &#8220;is not and should not be regarded as an encouragement or condonation for any person to cover their face&#8221; in situations previously caught by the ban.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have in no way determined the appeals one way or the other,&#8221; Poon wrote. &#8220;If one is to continue to wear masks &#8230; in the meantime, he has to face the inherent risk of having acted contrary to the law should the [HKSAR government] later succeed on appeal.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor speaks during a media session in September. File photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said the SAR government is directly responsible for the pro-establishment camp&#8217;s defeat in the district council elections, and the government would continue to hear opinions from political parties.</p>
<p>Many voters simply expressed their dissatisfaction with the SAR government and voted not to support pro-establishment candidates, instead of looking at their previous performance in the district and their proposals on addressing local problems, said Lam at a press event on Tuesday.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, Lam felt natural to apologize to those pro-establishment councilors defeated in the elections, and refused to avoid taking such stance, according to the SAR government official news site on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Lam said the SAR government would continue to listen to those political parties that have been working hard for the city, and would not take them as strangers just because they have lost certain titles, the report said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lam&#8217;s response came after she reportedly apologized Monday to more than 10 defeated district council members of the Hong Kong Federation of the Trade Unions and promised to give them public service employment, Hong Kong media outlet HK01 reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Lam is expected to pay a duty visit to Beijing from Saturday to December 17 to brief state leaders on Hong Kong&#8217;s latest economic, social and political situation.</p>
<p>During the press conference, Lam also urged the public to stop spreading rumors that the government plans to replace some governing bodies or members of the executive council, stressing that restoring the rule of law and social order is the priority to ensure the city moves forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expressing concerns about student participation in rallies that have turned violent, Lam said more than 2,000 students, including middle school students, have been arrested during the social unrest in the past months, accounting for 40 percent of all those who have been detained.</p>
<p>Lam also condemned rioters who committed arson during a weekend protest, and also stressed that the government respects the right of citizens to hold lawful rallies that are conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner.</p>
<p>Black-clad protesters again obstructed Hong Kong streets on Sunday during a rally organized by opposition groups. Although the rally was generally peaceful, violent and illegal acts still occurred, with rioters setting fires at two courthouses in the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong district council elections in November saw the pan-democrats take control of 17 the city&#8217;s 18 district councils after winning 388 seats against 63 for the pro-establishment camp.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Tuesday expressed concern over the involvement of students in illegal activities amid social unrest that has lasted for six months.</p>
<p>At a press briefing in the morning, Lam said she had asked schools to prevent their students from participating in illegal activities and follow the notice sent by the Education Bureau at the end of last month.</p>
<p>The police have arrested 6,022 people for offenses including unlawful assembly, participation in riot and possession of offensive weapons, among others, since June 9. Among them, 2,393 people or about 40 percent are students, and about 300 high schools in Hong Kong were involved.</p>
<p>Of the 12 people arrested on Monday morning, six were students and one was a teacher. Police seized flammable liquid and glass bottles, which could be used to make petrol bombs, and instruments for road blockage and vandalism, including nails, electric drills, homemade barricades for puncturing tires.</p>
<p>Lam said she had asked the secretary for education to seriously follow up the case of the teacher under arrest.</p>
<p>Two home-made remote-controlled bombs were found inside the campus of Wah Yan College, Wan Chai on Monday and were later defused by the police. The bombs were fully functional and may cause multiple casualties, according to the police.</p>
