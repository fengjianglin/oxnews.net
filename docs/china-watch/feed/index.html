<div align="left">
<p>Soldiers of the Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) could one day get their own &#8220;iron man&#8221; suits that feature heavy firepower, special armor and flying capability, military experts said on Wednesday as the PLA is reportedly evaluating advanced exoskeleton systems.</p>
<p>Headed by the Equipment Department of the PLA Army, the Super Warrior 2019 Military Individual Exoskeleton System Challenge took place recently in Beijing, with other challenges held in Shenzhen, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province and Xi&#8217;an, Northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province, according to a statement the PLA Army&#8217;s WeChat account Renminlujun released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nearly 100 teams from research institutes, universities and companies participated in the competition, as their exoskeleton products were tested and compared. The suits were tested for ability to carry heavy weight, mobility in rough terrain and artillery ammo loading, the statement said.</p>
<p>Worn as a kind of exoskeleton, the suits are installed with intelligent systems that can read users&#8217; intention and synchronize with their movement. The suits are being designed to provide extra kinetic energy to help enhance the strength, speed and stamina of users.</p>
<p>Military experts said the competition will spur advances among product developers, with the PLA Army choosing the best products, getting new ideas and communicating with developers so they can develop new exoskeletons for the army&#8217;s use in future warfare.</p>

<p>In the future, exoskeletons could also be connected to a network that allows information sharing and integrate with heavier individual weapons like automatic grenade launchers and light machine guns, giving individual soldiers strong firepower, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The competition also featured suits with special armor protections and individual flight systems, including a flying board similar to the one showcased at the French Bastille Day parade in July and a jetpack that seems to be worn on the back and provide thrust from two engines, according to the Army statement.</p>
<p>The current exoskeleton systems are still basic, but in the future the armor, weapons and flight systems will be integrated into a power suit that could turn ordinary soldiers to &#8220;iron man&#8221; soldiers, Wei said. </p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Aerial photo taken on July 1, 2019 shows a formation which spells out the words &#8220;I LOVE HK&#8221; to celebrate the 22nd birthday of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Hong Kong.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chaos and violence again descended on Hong Kong this weekend as the city&#8217;s festering social unrest entered its 22nd week.</p>
<p>Tension flared during the weekend as rioters smashed up an office of the Xinhua News Agency, which experts said trampled over the city&#8217;s freedom of speech in defiance of the central government.</p>
<p>They predicted the violence will escalate ahead of the city&#8217;s upcoming district council elections.</p>
<p>Seven districts were engulfed by skirmishes between police and rioters on Sunday afternoon, as shops including Yoshinoya, Maxim&#8217;s and other companies were vandalized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police ordered Tamar Park closed after rioters issued an online announcement of an illegal gathering there on Sunday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 4 pm, a masked mob, some wielding fire extinguishers, vandalized facilities like turnstiles and smashed up glass panes of a customer service center in Sha Tin MTR station, the police said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those actions followed Saturday&#8217;s protests which involved assaulting police officers and vandalism of public buildings including the Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau office of the Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>Police said on Sunday more than 200 people were arrested who took part in the Saturday protests.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, the Xinhua office in Wan Chai was attacked for the first time, with its glass doors and windows smashed.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong-based commentator who only gave his surname as Ho told the Global Times that the fire was contained in time and did not cause any extensive damage.</p>
<p>Xinhua issued a statement later saying it was &#8220;strongly indignant&#8221; over the &#8220;barbaric act&#8221; and hoped the police seriously investigate the incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Targeting the Xinhua News Agency showed the rioters&#8217; grudge toward Chinese mainland organizations was tinted with an obvious political agenda, said Chen Xinxin, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.</p>
<p>The Xinhua&#8217;s Hong Kong office made a special contribution to Hong Kong&#8217;s return to the motherland and so has symbolic meaning, Chen believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vandalism was in obvious defiance of the central government and mainland organizations, he noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The move in some way also threatened the city&#8217;s freedom of speech… and is another infringement of Hong Kong&#8217;s law,&#8221; Chen said.</p>
<p>The Beijing-based All-China Journalists Association, the Hong Kong News Executives&#8217; Association both issued statements after the incident condemning the attack and demanding police look into it.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent violence</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday, MTR stations and businesses in Hong Kong&#8217;s densely populated commercial districts Causeway Bay, Wan Chai, Central, Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui again fell victim to vandalism and mob rampage.</p>
<p>The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong said Sunday morning that 54 people were injured and taken to hospital during Saturday&#8217;s protests and one man was in a serious condition.</p>
<p>According to a video clip circulating on local Hong Kong media, a group of black-clad rioters hit a man in Mong Kok and beat him to the ground, ripping off his underwear and leaving his face covered with blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Twitter, Hong Kong police described the act as &#8220;heinous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s identity remained unknown as of press time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Hong Kong police, rioters defied a police ban and illegally gathered at Victoria Park 2 pm on Saturday and the illegal gathering evolved into mass vandalism and violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong commentator Ho said he noticed that Saturday&#8217;s violence was upgraded from previous ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Previous riots usually start late and climaxed at 10pm,&#8221; said Ho. &#8220;But yesterday&#8217;s violent protests started early in the afternoon, which obviously posed a greater challenge for the police to contain.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another Hong Kong-based commentator who requested anonymity told the Global Times that with the looming Hong Kong district council elections this month, violent protesters intended to upgrade their violence, paralyze the city government and enlarge their influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anonymous commentator said his conclusion was based on the rioters expanding the targets for their violence to include Xinhua office for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong police said rioters threw Molotov cocktails, constructed fiery barricades and wielded planks with nails, ignoring the safety hazard they posed to pedestrians and neighboring residents.</p>
<p>The police said they confiscated 188 Molotov cocktails, several contraction batons and pepper sprays from rioters on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hongk Kong police confirmed to the Global Times that Andrew Chiu, a district counsellor, was attacked on Sunday&#8217;s clash and his ear was bitten off.</p>
<p><strong>Lam supported</strong></p>
<p>After concluding her visit to Shanghai to attend the Second China International Import Expo on Tuesday, Hong Kong&#8217;s Chief Executive Carrie Lam will depart for Beijing in the evening, the city government said in a statement on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day she will be received by Vice Premier Han Zheng. Lam will attend the third plenary meeting of the Leading Group for the Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Leading Group).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Leading Group, led by Han, held the first plenary meeting in August 2018 and the second in March this year where they endorsed measures to facilitate Hong Kong people to develop, work and reside in mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meeting would probably focus on facilitating people from Hong Kong and Macao to work and live on the mainland, Tang Fei, a member of Beijing-based Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>Such a move would help Hong Kong out of the current difficult situation and solve deep-rooted social problems including Hong Kong&#8217;s development within the Greater Bay Area, Tang believed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He noted that Han&#8217;s meeting with Lam also would serve to dispel rumors that Beijing planned to replace Lam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows the central government&#8217;s strong support for Lam,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is very important to stabilize morale when the most urgent task for Hong Kong is to ease the violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hong Kong slipped into a technical recession as its economy shrank 3.2 per cent in the third quarter from the previous quarter amid ongoing social unrest, the city&#8217;s census and statistics department said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The decline between July and September followed a 0.4 percent drop in the second quarter, marking a fall in two consecutive quarters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s second aircraft carrier, the first domestically built, appears to be preparing for a possible commissioning ceremony since it returned from its eighth sea trial, photos and videos showed.</p>
<p>Troops in white naval uniforms lined the warship&#8217;s flight deck on the morning of October 24 and practiced an inspection ceremony, Hong Kong-based news website wenweipo.com reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A barge loaded with a crane approached the bow of the ship, as workers on the crane painted a huge &#8220;1&#8221; on the ship&#8217;s hull, according to photos and videos posted in the wenweipo.com report.</p>
<p>However, the number has since been erased and no further markings were visible as of Tuesday, the report said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Painting a hull number is usually a sign that a warship is about to join military service,&#8221; a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The moves mentioned in the report could indicate that the aircraft carrier will be commissioned soon, military enthusiasts said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s first aircraft carrier<br />
<em>Liaoning</em> was delivered and commissioned to the PLA Navy on September 25, 2012 in Dalian after years of refitting and sea trials. Then president and Central Military Commission chairman Hu Jintao endorsed the naming certificate of<br />
<em>Liaoning</em> in a commissioning ceremony, the Xinhua News Agency reported then.</p>
<p>Hu and then premier Wen Jiabao oversaw the ceremony, as Navy honor guards received inspection on board of the ship, according to the Xinhua report. </p>
<p>The<br />
<em>Liaoning</em> has the hull number 16, and many military observers expect the yet-to-be-named second carrier will bear the number 17. </p>
<p>The second aircraft carrier is moored at the Dalian Shipyard in Northeast China&#8217;s Liaoning Province, after it returned from its eighth sea trial held between October 15 and 20, wenweipo.com reported. </p>
<p>Military experts told the Global Times as the carrier first set out on its eighth sea trial the voyage would likely serve as an examination of the warship&#8217;s readiness for final delivery, and that they expected the ship to be commissioned into the Chinese Navy this year. </p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Model of the FL-2 long range multipurpose high-subsonic transport drone on display at a military-civilian equipment and technology expo in Xi&#8217;an, Northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province, in 2019. Photo: screenshot of WeChat account of Ordnance Industry Science Technology</p>
<p>A Chinese company recently showcased an in-development stealth transport drone that features a hybrid of conventional and flying wing design, which could represent a trend for future large transport planes, analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Developed by Zhong Tian Guide Control Technology Co Ltd, the FL-2 stealth transport drone went on display at a recent military-civilian equipment and technology expo held in Xi&#8217;an, Northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province, Ordnance Industry Science Technology, a Xi&#8217;an-based periodical focused on the national defense industry, reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The aircraft has a flying wing aerodynamic design similar to the US&#8217; X-47B drone, but also has a pair of conventional V-shaped vertical tails, according to the report. Its fuselage also seems bulkier than other typical flying wing aircraft like the B-2 bomber.</p>
<p>Using two turbofan engines, the FL-2 has a liftoff weight of 22 tons, a ceiling of 15 kilometers, a cruise speed of 600 to 780 kilometers an hour, a max speed of 900 kilometers an hour, a range of 7,000 kilometers and an endurance of 10 hours, the periodical reported.</p>
<p>Developed as a long range multipurpose high-subsonic unmanned transport platform, the FL-2 has multiple cabins for carrying different types of cargo, or it can carry a single larger object, according to publicly available specifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FL-2 is still in its conceptual design stage, according to the company&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>Multiple Chinese flying wing aircraft projects have been running for some time and are beginning to yield results, an anonymous military expert told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>The GJ-11, Sky Hawk and CH-7 are all flying wing stealth drones, but they focus on reconnaissance and attack, the expert said, noting that applying the technology on a transport plane will not be difficult.</p>
<p>Flying wing usually means the plane has lower drag force while flying and has more space within its cabins, giving the aircraft more load capacity, Ordnance Industry Science Technology said.</p>
<p>The FL-2 can carry six tons of cargo, the report said.</p>
<p>Since the problem of flight control, one of the most challenging issues with a flying wing design, has been solved, this design has become a main concept for future large transport planes, it said, noting that the FL-2 could serve as an important technical demonstrator for China&#8217;s next generation transport plane.</p>

<p>Beijing will soon enforce new trash sorting rules that may call for fines of 200 yuan ($28.30) to individuals who refuse to properly dispose of their waste, while giving restaurants and hotels up to 5,000 yuan if they provide disposable products to customers.</p>
<p>According to a draft amendment to its trash management regulations released on the Beijing government&#8217;s website, residents will be required to sort their garbage and place it in specified collection containers or face a fine of up to 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Companies and organizations could be fined from 10,000 to 50,000 yuan if they fail to follow the new regulations, according to the draft. The draft requires residents to sort their garbage into four classifications &#8211; kitchen waste, recyclable waste, hazardous waste and residual waste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The draft requires restaurants, catering service providers and hotels not to automatically provide customers with disposable tableware or disposable household items, and can be fined from 1,000 to 5,000 yuan if they fail to follow the rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows that China is attempting to engineer a huge shift in how businesses and individuals deal with garbage,&#8221; said Liu Jianguo, a professor at the School of Environment of Tsinghua University.</p>
<p>Beijing started to promote garbage classification citywide around 2010, but lacked effective management and supervision, said Liu. &#8220;The draft amends the weak parts of the existing regulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new regulations will place new restrictions on food delivery and courier companies, showing that disposable products have become a serious environmental issue in China, Liu said.</p>
<p>Data analysis company Analysys International reported that China&#8217;s takeout food market will reach revenues of 195.29 billion yuan, up 35 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beijing&#8217;s move appears to be supported by most internet users, but many also question the government&#8217;s ability to effectively enforce the new regulations.</p>
<p>Shanghai was the first Chinese city to enforce new trash sorting rules on July 1. The city&#8217;s compliance rate of garbage classification in the residential areas has increased from 15 percent at the end of last year to 80 percent in the third quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>From January 1 to June 25, Shanghai&#8217;s urban management and law enforcement department carried out more than 13,900 law enforcement inspections, investigating 1,224 cases of violations and educating 13,739 people, the Xinhua News Agency reported on July 1.</p>
<p>A Shanghai citizen Lin Ting said she was told that spent batteries are harmful trash that is harmful to the environment and was fined 200 yuan. &#8220;After that experience, I understood the importance of the regulations and make sure I sort my trash right every time before I throw it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai government&#8217;s website, a hot pot restaurant was fined 10,000 yuan in September for failing to sort its trash.</p>

More than 300 rare jellyfish were found in a man-made pool on Yimeng Mountain. Photo: IC</p>
<p>An extremely rare species of freshwater jellyfish the size of a penny, that has existed for 550 million years and predates dinosaurs, was recently spotted in an advanced wastewater treatment facility in South China.</p>
<p>The freshwater jellyfish, or Craspedacusta sowerbii, were discovered in the facility at Guilin University of Technology in South China&#8217;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Beijing-based Science and Technology Daily reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The facility was built in early 2017 to improve water quality of the lake on the campus. During a water quality inspection in September 2017, creatures resembling jellyfish were found in water samples, Zhang Wenjie, an environmental scientist and engineering professor at the university, told the paper.</p>
<p>Only a few of the creature were seen in the first sample, but they reappeared in September 2018 and September 2019, leading Zhang to run a test that identified the creatures as freshwater jellyfish.</p>
<p>Listed as a critically endangered species in 2002, the freshwater jellyfish are also called the &#8220;water panda,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Having a diameter between 15 to 25 millimeters and tentacles of about 20 millimeters, the &#8220;living fossils&#8221; are the only known jellyfish that lives in fresh water, according to the Daily.</p>
<p>They thrive in clean, clear water that&#8217;s between 25 C&nbsp;and 32 C, and feed on animal plankton, which is why they are often observed between June and October, when the water is at the right temperature and there is sufficient food.</p>
<p>Zhang said that the freshwater jellyfish not only looks beautiful, they are also&nbsp;a key species in the study of evolution, giving them high academic value.</p>
<p>Zhang wants the favorable environment protected for the jellyfish and the continued treatment of wastewater before it is released into natural waters.</p>
<p>Freshwater jellyfish once lived throughout China, but because of pollution they are now only found in a handful of places, the report said.</p>

<p>No casualties were reported after a 5.2-magnitude earthquake jolted Beiliu, South China&#8217;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region at 10:55 pm on Saturday, which caused the suspension of several trains, local authorities said.</p>
<p>The epicenter, with a depth of 10 kilometers, was monitored at 22.18 degrees north latitude and 110.51 degrees east longitude, the China Earthquake Network Center said on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were no reports of casualties or structures collapsing, and local transportation and electricity have not been affected so far, according to a report by cctv.com on Sunday.</p>
<p>Beiliu felt a strong sharp shake from the quake and tremors were felt in most areas in other cities, such as Nanning and Wuzhou, in Guangxi, said the report.</p>
<p>China Railway Nanning Group Co Ltd suspended nine trains to ensure passengers&#8217; safety and some trains were delayed due to the earthquake, cctv.com said.</p>
<p>A video posted on Sunday by Pearl Video on Sina Weibo shows that tremors could also be felt in Guangxi&#8217;s neighboring province Guangdong, and many residents from Guangdong&#8217;s Huazhou fled into the streets during the earthquake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in my dorm room, which is on the sixth floor, and my bed was shaking like I was playing on trampoline,&#8221; a netizen from Nanning wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was playing an online shooting game. When the quake happened, I thought a bomber had come,&#8221; another person from Beiliu commented.</p>
<p>Local authorities announced that it is unlikely that a larger earthquake would occur in the area and urged local citizens not to panic but go about their normal business.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Mount Taishan</p>
<p>East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province saw revenues of more than 63 billion yuan ($8.8 billion) during the recent weeklong National Day holidays, while its neighbor Shandong Province welcomed the largest number of visitors.</p>
<p>Jiangsu came top among the 25 provincial regions that revealed their incomes over the Chinese &#8220;Golden Week,&#8221; according to the China News Service on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jiangsu has 23 5A-class scenic spots out of the country&#8217;s 250, the most in China. It is home to the cities of Nanjing and Suzhou, which are popular destinations for tourists.</p>
<p>Jiangsu is followed by East China&#8217;s Shandong Province, which saw Golden Week revenues of 57.9 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Shandong was also the most visited destination during the holiday, with almost 70 million visitors, up 7.6 percent year on year, local authorities said Tuesday, the Xinhua News Agency reported.</p>
<p>Shandong is home to famous attractions such as Mount Taishan, the Confucius Family Mansion and popular coastal cities, including Qingdao, Weihai and Yantai.</p>
<p>Besides Shandong, seven other provinces also hosted at least 60 million tourists, the China News Agency reported.</p>
<p>Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province and Central China&#8217;s Henan Province also saw revenues of over 50 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing Municipality saw 38 million tourists, even more than the local population of 31 million. The city&#8217;s government asked citizens to stay at home and give way to tourists, said the China News Agency.</p>
<p>Data from the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/22.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Culture</a> and Tourism released on Monday showed that China saw 782 million domestic visits over the weeklong holidays, an increase of 7.81 percent year-on-year, while domestic tourism revenue reached 649.71 billion yuan, an increase of 8.47 percent on a yearly basis.&nbsp; About 78.84 percent of tourists participated in activities celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, Xinhua reported.</p>

<p>A state-owned company is saving manpower and ensuring construction safety and quality through the use of pioneering technology in the mechanical construction of a tunnel in Southwest China&#8217;s Guizhou Province.</p>
<p>Longchang Tunnel, part of the Guihuang Expressway in the city of Fuquan, is two kilometers long and passes through a thick layer of limestone and dolomite, which increases the difficulty of construction.</p>
<p>To meet the challenges posed by the complex environment, China Communications Construction Second Highway Engineering Co has pioneered the use of robots and improved safety with the use of a real-time monitoring system and GPS. Virtual reality (VR) technology is also being used to train construction workers, Ma Jianyun, general engineer of the tunnel project, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The tunnel is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019, said Fan Wei, director of a department of the company. After construction, the tunnel will play an important role in regional industrialization and urbanization, and will help to lift surrounding towns and counties out of poverty.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>VR pre-job training</strong></span></p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>Workers have to undergo safety training before joining the construction. The training includes watching animated demonstrations of safety situations based on VR technology and playing assessment games to test their knowledge, the Global Times reporter observed on site.</p>
<p>In the training room, Liu Guiping, the company&#8217;s safety coordinator, demonstrated how to put out a fire using an extinguisher, along with other VR-simulated situations.</p>
<p>The innovative training method greatly improves workers&#8217; awareness of safety, Liu said.</p>
<p>The company is also using nine kinds of robotic machines on the project, each of which has a clear function, such as geological forecasting, tunneling and arched frame installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &#8220;robot family,&#8221; which takes up tasks formerly done by humans, is the main labor force in the construction process, Ma noted.</p>
<p>Workers only need to sit in the air-conditioned cabin of the intelligent three-arm drilling jumbo to press the start button and watch the machine accurately locate and drill holes in the tunnel.</p>
<p><center><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">In the training room, Liu Guiping, the company&#8217;s safety coordinator, undergoes safety training and experiences a simulated safety incident using virtual reality technology. Photo: Xu Keyue/GT</p>
<p>The 17-meter jumbo has telescopic drilling arms and can walk flexibly. The workers have named it &#8220;Bumblebee,&#8221; project manager Chen Jiabao said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The traditional manual construction method requires nearly 20 people who have to endure dust, noise and sweat, and take safety risks. The intelligent system now only needs two operators to control the robot, which makes the project faster, more efficient, safer and of higher quality,&#8221; Ma said.</p>
<p>In addition to the drilling, robots are used in other processes of the tunneling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mechanical construction in the whole process has saved on manpower by 35 percent. The number of people needed for the drilling, arch frame installation and shotcrete processes was reduced from about 40 to 12,&#8221; Ma said.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Ensuring workers&#8217; safety</span></strong></p>
<p>The company developed a Project Management System based on big data, GPS and AI technology, which can comprehensively monitor the tunnel, track workers, analyze air quality both inside and outside, and record the construction process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The system makes the entire construction traceable,&#8221; Ma said.</p>
<p>Every worker has to wear a uniform inserted with a GPS chip before entering the tunnel. Workers can communicate and share moments with each other in the system on their mobile devices. The company can also respond immediately when emergencies occur, ensuring construction safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system also can provide geological forecasts by using geology radar. In emergency situations, workers in the tunnel can call operators outside by using an emergency broadcasting system.</p>
<p>Tunneling incidents result in fatalities every year in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to media reports, three workers died and one was injured in August at the construction site of a tunnel in Zhaoqing, South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province. Five workers died in May after the collapse of a subway tunnel that was being constructed in Qingdao, East China&#8217;s Shandong Province.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Hong Kong police sergeant Lau Chak-kei, who is invited to participate in the celebrations of the 70th anniversary for the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, has an interview with the Global Times on Sunday at the Hong Kong International Airport before leaving for Beijing. Photo: Screenshot from video by Global Times</p>
<p>Hong Kong police sergeant Lau Chak-kei, who was invited to participate in the celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, said that he looks forward to seeing the fireworks, climbing the Great Wall and eating roast duck in Beijing, and many Chinese internet users extended a warm welcome to him.</p>
<p>A total of 10 representatives of the Hong Kong Police Force, including Lau, were invited to the military parade and celebrations of the 70th anniversary. They arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be Lau&#8217;s first visit to Beijing and he told the Global Times on Sunday that it was an honor to represent the Hong Kong Police Force on the anniversary.</p>
<p>Lau attracted wide attention for pointing a shotgun at rioters in self-defense outside Kwai Chung police station in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on July 30. He has become a star on Weibo and has gained more than 510,000 followers as of Sunday.</p>
<p>Lau told the Global Times at the Hong Kong International Airport before leaving for Beijing that he has two main wishes for his Beijing trip: One is to see the military parade and the other is to go to the Great Wall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lau&#8217;s remarks attracted many Chinese netizens&#8217; attention and the video of his interview has been viewed more than 4 million times as of Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many netizens said that they were happy to see Lau come to the Chinese mainland, and that they hope he can enjoy his time in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome Lau sir! Thank you for your great effort in putting down the riots and maintaining peace and stability in Hong Kong,&#8221; one netizen commented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice to see you, but to go to the Great Wall is a bad idea during the Golden Week of the National Day as there will be too many people,&#8221; said another. &#8220;I will show you the best place to have authentic roast duck.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Hong Kong police, the invited representatives of the Hong Kong Police Force include police officers and some management personnel who participated in curbing the violence in Hong Kong in the past two months, the China News Service reported in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lin Zhiwei, chairman of the Hong Kong Police Forces Association and also one of the invited representatives, said in an interview with the China News Service that the invitation is a great honor and shows the affirmation from the central government for the work of the Hong Kong police. Lin said they will unswervingly overcome all the difficulties to maintain Hong Kong&#8217;s stability and prosperity.</p>
