<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The aircraft carrier <em>Liaoning</em> battle group steam on the sea. The aircraft carrier <em>Liaoning</em> (Hull 16), several guided-missile destroyers, frigates and dozens of aircraft attached to the Navy of the Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army took part in a combat exercise at an unidentified area east of the Bashi Channel in the western Pacific on Apr. 20. The exercise was a routine arrangement as a part of the PLA Navy&#8217;s annual training plan. (Photo/eng.chinamil.com.cn)</p>
<p>The Chinese People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy is training jet fighter pilots to sail and command warships, a move that aims to create more capable commanding officers for aircraft carriers, according to military experts.</p>
<p>Experienced pilots from carrier-borne aircraft units and advanced fighter jet units started learning warship combat and command at an undisclosed naval academy in late November, the PLA Daily reported on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a whole new exploration by the navy to develop ship-aircraft command talent, as China&#8217;s aircraft carrier force is in urgent need of such talent, the PLA Daily said, noting that the trainees were carefully selected, passing more than 10 tests including political thought, psychological quality and comprehensive abilities.</p>
<p>One such trainee is Xu Ying, chief of staff at an aircraft carrier-borne fighter jet base, who was among the first in the country to receive certification to operate a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier at both daytime and nighttime.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the training, I need to finish courses including ship navigation, basic combat, military training and management, strategic thinking and aircraft carrier combat,&#8221; Xu said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will gain the ability to command coordinated ship-aircraft operations by actually sailing warships and passing tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>The training seeks to develop inter-disciplinary talent, as their experiences in both flying and sailing would work in synergy, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing military analyst, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe this is a move that aims to create top commanding officers for future aircraft carriers,&#8221; Wei said, noting that this kind of talent would be practical in boosting the capability of carriers.</p>
<p>Many US aircraft carrier captains and officers at command posts used to be carrier-borne aircraft pilots, and this model is worth studying, Wei said.</p>
<p>Liu Zhe, captain of the<br />
<em>Liaoning</em>, China&#8217;s first aircraft carrier, said on China Central Television in August 2017 that only the US required aircraft carrier captains to be pilots first due to the massive scale of its aircraft carrier fleet.</p>
<p>Liu said he was only a surface vessel officer and no pilot. He said he learned to fly trainer aircraft and helicopters, but only for a few hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we have more aircraft carriers in the future and more [carrier-based] pilots, as they grow older, there will be [pilots who become captains],&#8221; Liu said.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Special mission aircraft including anti-submarine aircraft are being built in a pulse assembly line at AVIC Shaanxi Aircraft Industry (Group) Corporation Ltd. Photo: Screenshot from China Central Television</p>
<p>China is mass-producing special mission aircraft, including anti-submarine aircraft, early warning aircraft, surveillance aircraft and electronic warfare aircraft, a genre of warplanes that Chinese experts said on Sunday will help create a full information system that allows the Chinese military to recognize every hostile movement and even sabotage enemy communications.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Aircraft Industry (Group) Corporation Ltd (SAIC) under the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) has been manufacturing special mission aircraft with its pulse assembly line, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The advanced assembly line has been recently built, has a size of more than two soccer fields and fused digital, information-oriented and intelligence concepts, CCTV said, noting that compared to the traditional assembly workshops at SAIC, the new pulse assembly line is 30 percent more efficient in manufacturing aircraft and requires less workers.</p>
<p>The pulse assembly line at SAIC has five stations, each is assigned with tasks of assembling certain components to its aircraft, said Peng Fei, chief engineer at SAIC, on CCTV.</p>
<p>Components will enter from station one, stopping at each station and leave station five as fully assembled aircraft ready for delivery, Peng said, noting that the next aircraft will enter the line as the previous one goes to the next station, enabling a very efficient manufacturing model.</p>
<p>The establishment of a pulse assembly line is an indication that China&#8217;s special mission aircraft have entered a mass-production phase, a military expert who asked not to be named told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pulse assembly line is only cost efficient when it produces a certain type of aircraft in large numbers, since the construction of such a line is expensive,&#8221; the expert said.</p>
<p>For instance, as many as 10 fully assembled special mission aircraft including KJ-500 early warning aircraft and other surveillance aircraft can be seen parked in an open area at SAIC in a single screenshot of the official CCTV report. They are expected to take test flights and be delivered to the military.</p>
<p>Most of China&#8217;s special mission aircraft are designed based on the Y-8 transport plane because of its large payload capability and utility, CCTV reported.</p>
<p>China for the first time displayed its special mission aircraft fleet at the National Day military parade on October 1. The fleet included Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft, KJ-500 early warning aircraft, Y-8 surveillance aircraft, Y-9 psychological warfare aircraft, Y-9 communications countermeasures aircraft, Y-8 electronic countermeasures aircraft, and Y-8 command and communications aircraft, according to Weapon magazine.</p>
<p>A massive fleet of these warplanes will weave a full information system in information-based modern warfare and give the Chinese military an edge by grasping every detail on the battlefield and disrupting hostile communications, the expert said.</p>

<p>After a top Chinese arms firm showcased multiple types of artificial diamonds at a recent jewelry exhibition, military experts on Wednesday said the gemstones could also be used in military equipment, including laser weapons and other precision machines.</p>
<p>The colorful synthetic diamonds on display at the recent 2019 China International Jewellery Fair in Beijing included large, high clarity samples, according to a statement by China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) on its WeChat account on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Synthetic diamonds are made in laboratories using special materials which are put under high pressure and temperatures or treated with chemical vapors.</p>
<p>NORINCO is the developer of many of China&#8217;s main battle equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, guns, rockets and munitions.</p>
<p>Military analysts said artificial diamonds have many practical military uses.</p>
<p>High-energy laser weapons may need industrial-level diamonds to ensure that their energy output is high enough to damage their targets, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Artificially produced diamonds can be used in core components of laser weapons and cost far less than natural diamonds, Wei said.</p>
<p>Diamonds are also widely used in radar equipment, high-precision machine manufacturing and aerospace optical devices, analysts said, noting that their hard, corrosion-resistant traits make them useful in a range of products from drills to microelectronics.</p>
<p>Due to the wide potential of diamonds, foreign countries often list artificial diamond-making technologies as confidential and won&#8217;t share information with China, leading the country to independently develop its own processes to make artificial diamonds for its arms industry and high-tech development, analysts said.</p>
<p>If the Chinese arms giant is able to sell a significant number of artificial diamonds to jewelers, the money could also be reinvested in its arms research projects, military observers said.</p>

<p>China is sending its troops to Pakistan for a month-long joint military exercise, a move that will boost the two countries&#8217; military cooperation and capability to jointly deal with terrorist threats including those targeting joint projects with China, experts said on Monday.</p>
<p>A Chinese unit from a special forces brigade of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Military Region departed from their base camp Saturday morning and began mobilizing in Pakistan for the &#8220;Warrior VII&#8221; joint exercise, using vehicles and aerial transportation, according to a statement released on Monday by China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/2.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of National Defense</a>.</p>
<p>This is the seventh &#8220;Warrior&#8221; series exercise between the two countries&#8217; special forces, the ministry said, noting that the drills will focus on deepening cooperation and communication, learning from each other&#8217;s combat experience and boosting the ability to deal with security threats and launch diversified missions.</p>
<p>A new exercise subject, joint defense of key facilities, will be added to the drills, as troops will engage in counter-terrorism in mountainous areas, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Li Wei, a counter-terrorism expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday that key facilities might include iconic government and civilian buildings and major projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, as these could be targets for terrorists, based on past events.</p>
<p>Construction sites, mines, harbors and highways might also be vulnerable to terrorist attacks, Li said.</p>
<p>The joint exercise will help to strengthen weak spots and find ways to prevent attacks in the first place, Li said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drills will feature live ammunition that will put both commanders&#8217; and soldiers&#8217; capabilities to the test, said Yang Lei, commander of the Chinese unit, in the defense ministry statement, noting that the event will enrich military training cooperation and deepen the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani armies.</p>
<p>Chinese and Pakistani air forces wrapped up the half-month-long Shaheen VIII joint exercises, featuring some of the two countries&#8217; top aircraft, in northwestern China in August. The two countries will also hold a joint naval exercise in Pakistani waters in January.</p>
