<p>Following China&#8217;s ban of both direct and indirect imports of cattle and relevant products from India due to the country&#8217;s outbreak of infectious lumpy skin disease, Chinese experts urged India to improve the quality of its export products to reduce its trade deficit with China.</p>
<p>If the Chinese border inspection or any other agency finds illegally imported Indian cattle or relevant products, they will destroy the products, read an announcement on the website of the General Administration of Customs on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The new rule will likely deal a blow to India&#8217;s beef exports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although China has banned direct purchases of buffalo meat from India since 2001 following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the South Asian country, India still sells buffalo meat to China via some Southeast Asian countries, said Yang Chun, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s shipments of buffalo meat and offal to the Chinese mainland via Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, slumped 23 percent year-on-year to 14,645 containers in the first 10 months of 2019, Indian news site The Economic Times reported, citing data from the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, if India can improve the quality of its beef exports, it&#8217;s possible for India to directly sell beef to China in the future along with growing market demand,&#8221; Yang told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s beef demand is between 7 million to 8 million tons a year, with the amount of imported beef expected to reach 1.5 million tons this year, up 50 percent year-on-year, she said.</p>
<p>However, India has repeatedly complained about its trade imbalance with China.</p>
<p>To narrow the imbalance, India should think about how to improve the competitiveness of its industries, companies and products, Dai Yonghong, a professor of the Institute of South Asia Studies at Sichuan University, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;If India can produce high-quality products at good prices, why wouldn&#8217;t Chinese like them? Why wouldn&#8217;t Indian exports increase?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Bilateral trade between China and India was on the rise in 2018. China exported $76.71 billion worth of goods to India, up 12.7 percent year-on-year, while imports from India stood at $18.83 billion, up 15.2 percent year-on-year, data from the Chinese<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> showed.</p>
<p>With a total population of about 2.7 billion, the two rapidly growing Asian countries have great potential in trade and economic cooperation, Dai said, noting that &#8220;India shouldn&#8217;t rely solely on China to solve the trade imbalance problem; rather it should step up efforts to reform its own industries.&#8221;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s direct investment in Egypt in the first three quarters of 2019 rose by 66 percent to 74.9 million U.S. dollars, a senior Chinese diplomat told a press conference on Tuesday at Egypt&#8217;s under-construction new administrative capital city, east of Cairo.</p>
<p>Han Bing, minister counselor for commercial affairs of the Chinese Embassy in Egypt, said these Chinese investments cover several fields including domestic electric appliances, motorbike manufacturing, agriculture and others.</p>
<p>He added that among those Chinese investors in Egypt are Dayun Motorcycle, Konka, New Hope Group and Angel Yeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile some Chinese enterprises specialized in steel, medicine, textile, new energy, garbage collection, and sewage treatment are interested in the Egyptian market and related projects under discussion,&#8221; Han told reporters.</p>
<p>The Chinese diplomat praised the &#8220;great effort&#8221; made by the Egyptian government to improve Egypt&#8217;s business environment for foreign investors through issuing a series of new investment-magnet policies.</p>
<p>Trade between China and Egypt slightly declined in the first 10 months of 2019 to 10.58 billion dollars, mostly represented in Chinese exports to Egypt.</p>
<p>&#8220;China remains Egypt&#8217;s first trade partner,&#8221; Han noted.</p>
<p>Egypt&#8217;s exports to China include agricultural crops such as oranges, grapes and sugar beets, he said, adding Egypt is the top orange exporter to China with a market share of more than 40 percent.</p>
<p>Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA), a Chinese industrial developer, is currently developing an area of 7.23 square km in Egypt&#8217;s vital Suez Canal economic zone. It has completed the first phase of about 1.25 square km and is working on the second phase of some six square km in Ain Sokhna district of Suez Province, east of the capital Cairo.</p>
<p>&#8220;TEDA zone has altogether 84 enterprises including 42 manufacturing companies, and has attracted more than 1-billion-dollar investment,&#8221; Han pointed out.</p>
<p>The Chinese diplomat also referred to growing cooperation between China and Egypt under the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative that seeks common development for participating states through win-win partnerships.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Yuan Longping (2nd R) , the &#8220;father of hybrid rice&#8221;, inspects a demonstration field with other experts at Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center in Changsha, capital of Hunan Province, Oct. 22, 2019. The third-generation hybrid rice developed by Yuan Longping, the &#8220;father of hybrid rice,&#8221; and his team underwent its first public yield monitoring from Monday to Tuesday and achieved high output. The final yield of the tested variety, G3-1S/P19, came to 1,046.3 kg per mu (about 667 square meters), based on two plots of land in Qingzhu Village under the city of Hengyang in Hunan. (Xinhua/Chen Zeguo)</p>
<p>As the world pioneer in hybrid rice technology, China has helped the Republic of Madagascar grow the grain for 13 years with remarkable results &#8211; yields have tripled in the African country, the head of a leading Chinese hybrid rice firm in Madagascar told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though Madagascar has a 400-year history of growing rice, yields were less than 2.5 tons per hectare in the past. But they soared to 7.5 tons per hectare under instruction of Chinese agricultural experts and companies, Zhang Lijun, manager of the Madagascar agricultural industrial park of Hunan Province-based Yuan Longping High-Tech Agriculture Co, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese agronomist Yuan Longping, known for developing the first hybrid rice strains, is praised as the &#8220;father of hybrid rice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The highest yield of the hybrid rice could reach 10.8 tons per hectare in Madagascar,&#8221; he noted, adding that hybrid rice seeds and sowing methods from China made this happen on 20,000 hectares of rice paddies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our sowing method of hybrid rice doesn&#8217;t require transplanting as the Madagascar farmers used to do. One farmer could only transplant rice seedlings on less than 0.1 hectares per day, but now the farmer could seed 0.2 to 0.3 hectares per day using our method,&#8221; Zhang said.</p>
<p>He noted that about 20 Chinese experts and staff now work in the agricultural industrial park.</p>
<p>Chinese hybrid rice technology helped local farmers increase their incomes by $300 &#8211; $400 per hectare per year, according to Zhang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Madagascar has become the country with the largest planting area and the highest yield of hybrid rice in Africa, and the first African country to realize the development of the entire industrial chain of hybrid rice breeding, seed production, planting, processing and sales, China Radio International reported.</p>
<p>On Monday, the China National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center and Guangdong Province-based property company Country Garden&#8217;s agriculture division signed a cooperation deal with Madagascar&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/20.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Agriculture</a>, Livestock and Fisheries, to help the African country realize rice self-sufficiency by 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2018, China-Africa trade in farm products increased from $650 million to $6.92 billion, with an average annual growth rate of 14 percent, said Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Changfu.</p>
<p>By the end of 2018, Chinese enterprises had invested more than 15 billion yuan ($2.13 billion) in Africa, with 115 agricultural projects worth more than 5 million yuan, covering more than two-thirds of African countries, according to the ministry.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is willing to share its experience and practices in food production and vows to support Africa in achieving food security by 2030,&#8221; said Han.</p>
<p>In the next three years, China will hold training courses to train another 10,000 agricultural experts in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value of agricultural trade between China and Africa is expected to exceed $10 billion within 10 years, chinanews.com reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Chinese companies will invest $50 million to build an agricultural industrial park in Madagascar, with an annual production of 4,000 tons of hybrid rice, the report said.</p>

<p>In the Year of the Pig, China&#8217;s traditional hog farming industry is undergoing tremendous changes as both big and small farms revamp themselves to combat one of the world&#8217;s worst animal diseases.</p>
<p>Hit by outbreaks of African swine fever, China&#8217;s pig herd shrank by some 40 percent year-on-year in recent months, causing pork prices to increase and pushing authorities to take measures to stabilize supply.</p>
<p>While the disease has posed challenges to farmers, it also accelerated the shift of China&#8217;s hog production from backyard pigpens to large-scale, standardized farms with better biosecurity measures and environmental treatment facilities, analysts said.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling up</strong></p>
<p>While cyclical fluctuations of pork supply and prices are a worldwide phenomenon, such volatilities are especially high in China, partly because the majority of the country&#8217;s pigs are produced on family farms.</p>
<p>Last year, the country&#8217;s top 10 listed companies with pig farming businesses produced less than 7 percent of the country&#8217;s hogs for slaughter, data from a research institute under property developer Evergrande showed.</p>
<p>The lack of standardized scale farming not only drags down productivity but also increases market volatility, as small-scale farms often lack the technology and facilities to control diseases, according to Zhu Zengyong, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).</p>
<p>The government has been stepping up efforts to scale the sector up, with the State Council releasing guidelines in September that aim to raise the ratio of hogs produced by scale farms to 58 percent by 2022 and 65 percent by 2025 from roughly 49 percent in 2018.</p>
<p>In an action plan to restore hog production released Friday, the country vowed to add 120 pilot hog farms with standardized operations in the next three years, which could serve as examples to boost industry standardization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large-scale farms can provide stable supply across cycles, reducing price volatilities,&#8221; said Qin Jun, vice general manager of Henan-based Muyuan Foods Co, one of the country&#8217;s largest hog producers.</p>
<p>Thanks to soaring pork prices, Muyuan reported an almost 300 percent year-on-year surge in net profit in the first three quarters.</p>
<p>The fat margin will allow the company to upgrade its facilities and invest in cutting-edge technologies, Qin said, adding that the company has invited programers and algorithm and mechanical engineers to join its research team to cut labor costs and better control diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the disease is a big challenge to the pig farming sector, it also leads to opportunities for corporate champions to build new production capacity and increase their competitiveness,&#8221; Qin said.</p>
<p><strong>Going green</strong></p>
<p>Raising pigs in an environmentally friendly way has been a thorny problem, but farmers and firms are scrambling to embrace this new trend as the government has stepped up efforts to make the industry greener.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recycle swine waste by turning swine waste into fertilizer,&#8221; said Wang Shijie, chairman of Henan Kanglong Industrial Group, an agricultural firm.</p>
<p>On a piece of land as big as 10 soccer fields, the firm can raise 2,000 pigs per year while growing crops. After it is processed, swine waste can satisfy the fertilizing demand of that land, said Wang, adding that this method can effectively utilize waste, achieve zero emissions and boost soil fertility.</p>
<p>The pro-environment approach reflects a new trend of pig farming promoted by the government. In 2016, China issued a five-year plan to steer its hog production. The plan called for efforts to accelerate the green development of pig farming in a bid to expand its overall hog production capacity and build up its international competitiveness.</p>
<p>The new action plan released Friday also vowed policy support for waste utilization, aiming for a comprehensive animal waste utilization rate of over 75 percent by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>To meet the higher green standards, pig farmers and firms are also turning to technologies. Chang Xianyun, a pig farmer who has 1,900 pigs in stock, believes that her heavy investment in waste treatment equipment is the right strategy.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old spent 500,000 yuan ($70,000) on upgrading her facilities, with the bulk of the money used on a wastewater treatment system. Chang said that no wastewater would be discharged from the farm if the new system is used.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the money is worth it because this is good for the farm, the environment and the people in the village,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Keeping farms clean is the key to raising healthy hogs, and using waste treatment facilities can reduce viruses and also strengthen disease prevention and control, said Wang Zuli, another researcher with the CAAS.</p>
<p>Industry giants have fat wallets to fare better. According to Qin, Muyuan spends some 10 million yuan on environmental protection facilities in every farm with 100,000 pigs, and installs a central ventilation system in every pigpen for disinfection and deodorization.</p>
<p>The improvement in the living environment of pigs also helped the company counter African swine fever, Qin said, adding that the company has so far managed to keep the impacts of the disease on its costs under control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) in China declined 43.7 percent year-on-year in November, contracting for a fifth month in a row, data from the country&#8217;s auto industry association showed on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From January to November, the production of NEVs was 1.09 million, a year-on-year increase of 3.6 percent, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Tuesday. During the same period, sales totaled 1.04 million, up 1.2 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CAAM forecast a contraction for the whole year.</p>
<p>The sharp decline in November and the lower forecast mainly reflect a government decision to cut subsidies for green cars, which hampered consumers&#8217; purchases, said an analyst, noting that 2020 will be a difficult year &#8211; and a turning point for China&#8217;s vast NEV market, the world&#8217;s largest.</p>
<p>China is expected to remove subsidies for the NEV sector in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previously, the domestic NEV market was booming but chaotic as many low-end NEVs were tailored to qualify for subsidies instead of market demand, and that era was bound to end,&#8221; Zeng Zhiling, an analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy LMC Automotive, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The sector will be more market-driven as government subsidies end, Zeng said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the subsidies encouraged the front-loading of consumption, especially in less-developed areas &#8211; another cause of the sharp drop, Zeng said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s NEV sector expanded robustly over the past years, with sales surging to more than 1.26 million units in 2018 from less than 10,000 in 2009. NEV sales jumped almost 62 percent last year even as the broader auto market contracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government will shift its policy in the sector from &#8216;stimulating&#8217; to &#8216;regulating&#8217; next year,&#8221; Zeng said.</p>
<p>Analysts said that despite the looming pain of a transition next year, NEV makers should be confident that government support for the sector is firm as always.</p>
<p>The<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/6.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a> released a draft plan for the domestic NEV industry on December 3, vowing to make pure electric cars a mainstream in the vehicle market. The ministry also set a target of having NEVs make up 20 percent of the country&#8217;s total sales by 2025.</p>
<p>The market has also attracted foreign players like Tesla and Volkswagen, which increased their bets in the world&#8217;s largest NEV over the past year</p>
<p>&#8220;They will further enrich customers&#8217; choices and increase competition for domestic players, that&#8217;s how the market should be,&#8221; Zeng said.</p>
<p>In November, total auto sales in China fell 3.6 percent year-on-year, a slight rebound from drops of 4 percent in October and 5.2 percent in September.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A visitor gets to know more about Chinese drone maker DJI&#8217;s latest crop protection drone, the T20, at a product launch event in Shenzhen, south China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, Nov. 5, 2019. Besides the new T20 crop protection drone, DJI also introduced an upgraded version of the drone&#8217;s spray system as well as appertaining service and training plans on Tuesday. (Xinhua/Mao Siqian) </p>
<p>In response to a report that the Japan Coast Guard plans to remove Chinese drone maker DJI from its procurement list under the guise of information security, DJI said that it regrets any restriction based on unfounded information and will continue to engage in talks with relevant Japanese departments.</p>
<p>The Japan Coast Guard plans to stop using and procuring Chinese-made drones in 2020 due to concerns over information security, Japan-based Nikkei reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The restriction is based on unfounded facts, DJI noted in a statement sent to the Global Times. DJI has explained its efforts in data security to Japanese media and will further strive to cultivate standards of drone technology, form a fair environment for all technology providers and ensure the satisfaction of customers.</p>
<p>Being merely a proposal, the move so far has had a limited impact on DJI&#8217;s business in Japan, a source close to the matter told the Global Times on condition of anonymity on Tuesday, without disclosing details of the company&#8217;s sales in Japan.</p>
<p>Asian countries like Japan and South Korea tend to take a more cautious attitude in aligning with the US stance, so DJI is still taking a wait-and-see approach, the source disclosed.</p>
<p>The essential stance of Japan toward Chinese cutting-edge technology is the same as that of the US, which is trying to hinder China&#8217;s development, said Zhang Jifeng, a vice director of the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.</p>
<p>However, Japan&#8217;s implementation of measures restricting Chinese companies, including Huawei and DJI, may vary from that of the US for the sake of its own interests, Zhang said, noting that the ultimate effect is still unclear and may not amount to much.</p>
<p>Given China&#8217;s development in various areas, Japan would take a flexible policy instead of simply following in the US&#8217; steps, he said.</p>
<p>Though Japan has already banned Huawei from government procurement contracts, 80 percent of its big companies are still choosing to do business with Huawei, including Sony and Panasonic, showed polls from Nikkei in October.</p>
<p>DJI has a global market share of more than 70 percent, according to the Xinhua News Agency. Experts said that such restrictions will exist for some time, and Chinese technology companies need to firmly develop their technology and products. Countries that decline to use these products will suffer the loss.</p>

<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1042932.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Korea</a> is reportedly considering launching a sovereign digital currency while China is diving into blockchain, there are opportunities for the two countries to cooperate in the sector, experts and industry insiders said.</p>
<p>A Chinese blockchain firm interviewed by the Global Times on Thursday showed interest in providing technology support and experience to contribute to the effort.</p>
<p>Shentu Qingchun, CEO of Shenzhen-based blockchain company BankLedger, said the company is willing to invest in blockchain-related industries in North Korea if the country opens up the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good opportunity. China has an edge in developing blockchain technology while North Korea could offer resources and a legion of application scenarios. Cooperation with North Korean companies in the sector could fast track the process and help overcome North Korea&#8217;s weak internet infrastructure,&#8221; Shentu told the Global Times.</p>
<p>He said his company can help apply blockchain in government administration as well as ticket sales and ticket checking.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could also help set up a cryptocurrency exchange in North Korea if the local regulators allowed us to do so,&#8221; Shentu said. His firm has invested in a Malaysia-based digital currency trading center known as dfex.com.</p>
<p>North Korea has been reportedly studied the launch of its own sovereign digital currency. As Businesskorea reported in April 2019, North Korea held a first-ever international event on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies from April 18 to 25.</p>
<p>A 36-year-old cryptocurrency specialist, Virgil Griffith, was arrested by the US Department of Justice on November 28, for allegedly helping North Korea use blockchain technology in violation of US sanctions and develop plans to transfer cryptocurrency between North Korea and South Korea, industry website decrypt.co reported.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged that he gave a presentation on how to use cryptocurrency during the conference, it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UN sanctions have not stipulated rules about blockchain and cryptocurrency so far,&#8221; Zhang Huizhi, vice dean of the Northeast Asian Studies College at Jilin University, told the Global Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>Lü Chao, a research fellow at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences in Shenyang, agreed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China and North Korea could cooperate on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency research to benefit each other. Especially for cryptocurrency, because it is an important step to enhance connectivity in finance,&#8221; Lü said.</p>
<p>He advised Chinese companies to be prudent and make tentative plans if they are interested in blockchain cooperation with North Korea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li Min, a senior partner with Shanghai Hansheng Law Offices, noted that there are many uncertainties about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, including supervision, market access and future development in different countries.</p>

<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China, the country&#8217;s central bank, and the Monetary Authority of Macao signed a currency swap agreement of 30 billion yuan ($4.26 billion) on Thursday, aiming to maintain financial stability and support the economic and financial development of the mainland and the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).</p>
<p>According to a statement on the central bank&#8217;s website, the agreement is valid for three years and can be extended upon mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Ding Meng, senior strategy analyst of Bank of China&#8217;s Macao Branch, told the Global Times on Thursday that the agreement is important to promote the internationalization of the yuan and the construction of an offshore yuan market in Macao.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important function of the currency swap agreement is to promote the use of the yuan in trade and increase its market liquidity,&#8221; said Ding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Along with the increase of international trade in Macao, there may be a shortage of yuan supply in the special administration region. This may result in fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates. However, the central bank can help ease market liquidity through the currency swap,&#8221; Ding said.</p>
<p>Ma Ben, assistant professor of Capital University of Economics and Business, told the Global Times that the agreement can also help reduce the transaction costs involved in using foreign currencies, and facilitate trade and investment between the mainland and Macao.</p>
<p>In 2018, mainland-Macao trade reached $3.16 billion, an increase of 3.3 times over the past 20 years, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recent years, China has signed currency swap agreements with South Korea, Malaysia, Argentina, Iceland and other countries, with expanding scale. This is one of the important measures to promote the internationalization of the yuan, and also it reflects the common vision of these countries committed to de-dollarization,&#8221; Ma noted.</p>

<p>The Chinese<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/8.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Public Security</a> has requested that companies remove 100 apps that have illegally collected users&#8217; private information from app stores for rectification, China&#8217;s cybersecurity authority said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The list of apps is the result of a tightened November campaign from regulators, cracking down on internet misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crackdown mainly focused on apps violating users&#8217; privacy &#8211; for example by not providing a privacy agreement, by providing a vague description of the usage of private information, or by collecting unnecessary information. Among the 100 listed apps, 27 were ordered to rectify their issues, 63 received administrative warnings and 10 were subject to penalties, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Listed industries include those involved in online education, health, e-commerce and financial services, read the statement. Several state-owned banks such as the China Everbright Bank and the Bank of Tianjin were also listed.</p>
<p>Xin Haiguang, a senior IT commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday that users&#8217; private information, including location and age, is a component of big data and could be used to analyze a customer&#8217;s preferences and needs, thus companies are eager to collect it.</p>
<p>&#8220;When these companies get your information, they know what you like and what you have been searching for online. Then they can send specialized advertisements to you, which can boost customer experience,&#8221; Xin said, warning that users should be cautious when apps ask for access to personal information.</p>
<p>Since the campaign was jointly launched by regulators including the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Industry and the Information Technology and Cyberspace Administration, a total of 683 apps that illegally collected users&#8217; private information have been investigated and dealt with, the statement said.</p>
