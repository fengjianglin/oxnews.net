<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Scientists have obtained the first image of a black hole, using Event Horizon Telescope observations of the center of the galaxy M87.

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />A Chinese-led research team has discovered a surprisingly huge stellar black hole about 14,000 light-years from Earth &#8212; our &#8220;backyard&#8221; of the universe &#8212; forcing scientists to re-examine how such black holes form.</p>
<p>The Milky Way galaxy is estimated to contain 100 million stellar black holes &#8212; cosmic bodies formed by the collapse of massive stars and so dense even light can&#8217;t escape. Until now, scientists had estimated the mass of an individual stellar black hole in our galaxy at no more than 20 times that of the Sun.</p>
<p>But the new discovery has toppled that assumption.</p>
<p>The team, headed by Liu Jifeng, of the National Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), spotted the black hole, which has a mass 70 times greater than the Sun. Researchers named the monster black hole LB-1.</p>
<p>The discovery was a big surprise. &#8220;Black holes of such mass should not even exist in our galaxy, according to most of the current models of stellar evolution,&#8221; said Liu.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought that very massive stars with the chemical composition typical of our galaxy must shed most of their gas in powerful stellar winds, as they approach the end of their life. Therefore, they should not leave behind such a massive remnant. LB-1 is twice as massive as what we thought possible. Now theorists will have to take up the challenge of explaining its formation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />Until a few years ago, stellar black holes could only be discovered when they gobbled up gas from a companion star. This process creates powerful X-ray emissions, detectable from Earth, which reveal the presence of the collapsed object.</p>
<p>The vast majority of stellar black holes in our galaxy are not engaged in a cosmic banquet though, and thus don&#8217;t emit revealing X-rays. As a result, only about 20 galactic stellar black holes have been accurately identified and measured.</p>
<p>To counter this limitation, Liu and his team surveyed the sky with China&#8217;s Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), looking for stars that orbit an invisible object, pulled by its gravity.</p>
<p>This observational technique was first proposed by the visionary English scientist John Michell in 1783, but it has only become feasible with recent technological improvements in telescopes and detectors.</p>
<p> <br />

It&#8217;s a truly gargantuan black hole, some 800 million times the mass of our sun. The size amazed and puzzled astronomers, according to reports. ((Photo:Ecns.cn/VCG))</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Still, such a search is like looking for a needle in a haystack: only one star in a thousand might be circling a black hole.</p>
<p>After the initial discovery, the world&#8217;s largest optical telescopes &#8212; Spain&#8217;s 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the 10-m Keck I telescope in the United States &#8212; were used to determine the system&#8217;s physical parameters. The results were fantastic: a star eight times heavier than the Sun was seen orbiting a 70-solar-mass black hole every 79 days.</p>
<p>The discovery is reported in the latest issue of the academic journal Nature.</p>

<p>Scientists in the United States have detected new genetic clues about hibernation, which may lead to better understanding and treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>The study published on Tuesday in the journal Cell Reports showed that hibernators may have evolved ways to &#8220;turn off&#8221; specific genetic elements controlling the activity of obesity genes compared to mammals that do not hibernate.</p>
<p>Hibernators like bear usually pack on massive weight during hibernation so they can survive months of slumber, but to scientists&#8217; surprise, they are as fit as ever after they reemerge.</p>

A series of activities were held at the zoo to celebrate the Halloween, attracting numbers of locals and tourists. (Xinhua/Zhang Cheng)</p>
<p>The researchers from the University of Utah focused on four hibernating mammals found in diverse habitats worldwide: the ground squirrel, little brown bat, gray mouse lemur, and lesser Madagascar hedgehog tenrec.</p>
<p>After comparing their genomes, they concluded that those mammals had independently evolved short, non-coding DNA snippets called parallel accelerated regions, which are disproportionately located near genes linked to obesity in humans.</p>
<p>Then they examined genes involved in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a human genetic disorder that triggers insatiable appetite and leads to morbid obesity.</p>

<p>It turns out that genes linked to PWS also have more hibernator accelerated regions than genes not associated with the syndrome. So they suggested those DNA snippets may invalidate genetic elements causing the metabolic disorder.</p>
<p>The newly discovered elements could improve our ability to learn how to evaluate and control obesity risks in humans by uncovering candidate master regulatory switches in the genome for controlling mammalian obesity, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our results show that hibernator accelerated regions are enriched near genes linked to obesity in studies of hundreds of thousands of people, as well as near genes linked to a syndromic form of obesity,&#8221; said the paper&#8217;s co-author Elliot Ferris, a bioinformatician at the University of Utah.</p>
<p>The Utah researchers identified a total of 364 potential genetic elements that could have a role in regulating hibernation and obesity. They are currently testing those components in laboratory mice using gene-editing tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chinese astronomers have discovered a special population of dwarf galaxies that mainly consist of baryons with radii of up to tens of thousands of light-years, where they are expected to be dominated by dark matter. </p>
<p>The discovery, made by researchers from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Science (NAOC), Peking University and Tsinghua University, was published in the latest issue of the science journal Nature Astronomy. </p>
<p>This result provides observational evidence that could challenge the formation theory of dwarf galaxies in the framework of standard cosmology, and may provide new clues to the nature of dark matter, said Guo Qi, a researcher from the NAOC and head of the research team. </p>
<p>In standard cosmology, the universe is dominated by cold dark matter and dark energy, while baryons only occupy 4.6 percent of outer space. Galaxies form and evolve in systems dominated by dark matter. </p>
<p>Statistical studies beyond the Local Group, our neighborhood in the universe, however, were hampered in the past due to the extreme faintness of the dwarf galaxies. </p>
<p>By analyzing the data of the Arecibo Observatory and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the research team found 19 dwarf galaxy candidates that are dominated by baryonic masses. </p>
<p>This result is difficult to explain with the standard galaxy formation model, and thus encourages people to revisit the nature of dark matter, Guo said. </p>
<p>Further observations are required to understand the formation of these particularly baryonic-dominated dwarf galaxies, Guo added.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s Chang&#8217;e-4 mission team on Monday received the only Team Gold Medal of the year awarded by Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) of the United Kingdom at its annual award ceremony held in London.</p>
<p>The Team Gold Medal, presented to the Chinese delegation led by Academician Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the lunar exploration project of China, is the first award ever that was presented to a team from China by the RAeS since its inception more than 150 years ago.</p>
<p>After the award ceremony, Wu expressed thanks to the RAeS and the award committee, and welcomed more countries and organizations to cooperate with China to jointly contribute to the efforts by mankind to further explore the space and pursue scientific discovery.</p>
<p>The Chang&#8217;e-4 probe made the first-ever soft landing on the Von Karman Crater in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the moon on Jan. 3, 2019. The complete success of the Chang&#8217;e-4 mission created another milestone in the lunar exploration history of the humankind.</p>
<p>Founded in 1866, the RAeS is one of the oldest aeronautical societies in the world. The annual awards are designed to honor outstanding teams and individuals worldwide in the field of aerospace studies and exploration.&nbsp;</p>

(Xinhua/Liang Xu)</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, astronaut and moonwalker Neil Armstrong described the outer space from another perspective: &#8220;It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn&#8217;t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.&#8221; </p>
<p>Today, the exploration and use of the outer space have been developing at an unexpectedly fast pace. But still, the vast and mysterious universe is far beyond the knowledge of human beings. </p>
<p>To achieve greater progress in this area, the international community needs to stand as one and form synergy. </p>
<p>JOINT EFFORTS </p>
<p>Ever since the Outer Space Treaty came into force on Oct. 10, 1967, the world has realized the importance of multilateral cooperation in science and technology advancement. </p>
<p>The treaty recognizes the common interest of all mankind in space exploration and believes that the exploration and use of outer space should be carried out for the benefits of all peoples. </p>
<p>&#8220;Collaboration in space exploration has provided what I would call&#8217;soft&#8217; diplomatic power for many decades, through the Cold War and after. It has helped improve relations between countries during time of great difficulty,&#8221; said Martin Barstow, a professor at University of Leicester and former president of the Royal Astronomical Society. </p>
<p>China has committed itself to these principles and made various contributions to the peaceful use of outer space. Its latest action is offering opportunities for experiments aboard China Space Station to all member states of the United Nations, with particular attention to developing countries. </p>
<p>China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) announced the selection of nine international scientific experiments aboard the China Space Station this June in Vienna. These experiments involve 23 entities from 17 countries and cover a diverse set of research areas such as space medicine, space life science, biotechnology, physics and astronomy. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is (a) tremendous idea. Experiments can be taken to the International Space Station (ISS) from many countries, but these usually have to belong to the ISS partners,&#8221; Barstow said. &#8220;A complete open call to countries worldwide is new, very exciting and will give opportunities to many countries that do not have access to space.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I think this sends a very positive message about collaboration and foster a good atmosphere across the space community,&#8221; said the professor. </p>
<p>UPHOLDING SPIRIT OF MULTILATERALISM </p>
<p>&#8220;I applaud the efforts of China in establishing a new foothold in space,&#8221; said Leonard David, a veteran space journalist and author of the newly-published book &#8220;Moon Rush &#8212; The New Space Race.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;From the vantage point of their space station, a variety of scientific pursuits can be staged, for the benefit of all humankind,&#8221; said David. </p>
<p>This is &#8220;the first time that something like that has been done,&#8221; according to Simonetta Di Pippo, director of UNOOSA. &#8220;We have other agreements with other space agencies and other entities to do similar things, but not so broad as in the case of the CSS (China Space Station).&#8221; </p>
<p>The UN space chief, in an interview with Xinhua in June, also said China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1070394.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beidou</a> Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is now &#8220;a real pillar in this architecture&#8221; of global navigation satellite systems. </p>
<p>&#8220;Together with Beidou, we bring up the same table the Russian Federation with GLONASS, the Europeans with Galileo and the Americans with GPS, plus others which are preparing &#8230; to launch their own systems,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>These systems are not in a war with each other, the UN space chief said, as there is a mechanism called ICG (International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems), which is &#8220;a sort of a role model in terms of international cooperation, because we put together all the providers and in this way we can increase precision.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;We can add a higher number of satellites and coverage so the signal is more precise and more stable,&#8221; which she said would allow the signals to be &#8220;used by everyone in the world.&#8221; </p>
<p>Author Frank White first coined the term the &#8220;overview effect&#8221; when he was flying in an airplane in the 1970s. From the vantage point up in the space, national boundaries disappear and conflicts that divide people become less important. </p>
<p>As White said, &#8220;We&#8217;re all part of that system, and there is a certain unity and coherence to it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>China extended its dominance in a list of the world&#8217;s fastest supercomputers by the number of systems, according to a semi-annual ranking of the Top500 published Monday. </p>
<p>The share of installations in China continues to rise strongly with 228 (45.6 percent) of all systems now listed as being installed in China. The share of system listed in the United States remains near its all time low at 23.4 percent. </p>
<p>The aggregate performance gap between China and the United States shrunk. The US systems translated to a 37.1 percent share, while China is close behind with a 32.3-percent performance share. </p>
<p>The list published in June had the United States with 38.4 percent of the aggregate performance and China with 29.9 percent. </p>
<p>The aggregate performance of the 500 systems, based on the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark, continued to rise, sitting at 1.65 exaflops. </p>
<p>Also, as a reflection of China&#8217;s lead in numbers, the top three system manufacturers with regard to the number of installations are Lenovo, Sugon, and Inspur. But Intel has maintained the dominance at the chip level, with its processors present in about 94 percent of all systems. </p>
<p>The top 10 of the list remained unchanged as Summit and Sierra, both IBM-built supercomputers, grabbed the top two spots, followed by two Chinese systems, Sunway TaihuLight and Tianhe-2A. </p>
<p>The entry level to the list has risen to 1.14 petaflops, up from 1.02 petaflops in the previous list in June 2019, according to the Top500 list.</p>

(Xinhua/Liang Xu)</p>
<p>&nbsp;China plans to complete the construction of a space station and have it put into operation around 2022, said Zhou Jianping, the chief designer of China&#8217;s manned space program, at a forum held in south China&#8217;s Guangdong Province. </p>
<p>The space station is designed to weigh 100 tonnes and accommodate three astronauts, which could be enlarged if needed, according to Zhou. </p>
<p>&#8220;The main goal of the construction of the space station is to enable China to become a country independently mastering the technology for long-term manned flight in near-Earth space, and having the capability to carry out long-term manned scientific experiments in near-Earth space and comprehensive development and utilization of space resources,&#8221; said Zhou at the 4th China Summit Forum on Human Factors Engineering, which was held at Sun Yat-sen University from Saturday to Sunday. </p>
<p>The space station will be built as China&#8217;s main platform for space science research, with the purposes of mastering the technologies in constructing and operating large space facilities, the technologies that guarantee life and health of astronauts who often fly in orbit, and the construction of a national space lab, according to Zhou.</p>
