<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Chinese and US trade officials make attempt at striking a trade deal to defuse an increasingly bruising trade war that has rattled global markets and presented mounting challenges to both economies. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Are China and the US on the way to reaching the first stage of a trade agreement? How far away is the realization of this goal? For some time, both sides have been sending out messages. The US actually contributes more information, but these messages often cancel each other out. It is still uncertain when a consensus can be reached for a phase one trade deal.</p>
<p>More importantly, why is it necessary to have such an agreement? Is it worth it for both sides to work toward that goal?&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one thing, achieving a phase one agreement would signal that the China-US trade war has reached a mutually recognizable turning point. According to the core concerns of both Beijing and Washington, China wants tariffs to be rolled back in the phase one trade agreement, which would be the first step to cancel the tariffs that have been imposed by the two sides since last year. For its part, the US wants China to buy a large amount of American agricultural products right now. If a deal is reached, both countries can benefit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, these economic interests alone are not enough to motivate the two sides to reach an significant result. China and the US can both bear the current losses, and potential future economic losses will be far from fatal for either country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US government believes that China&#8217;s economy is being battered, which is totally self-deceiving propaganda. The trade war has caused China some difficulties, but these difficulties will never lead to significant political compromises by Beijing. China&#8217;s economy is basically under smooth operation, and Chinese society has adapted to cope with the trade war.</p>
<p>The significance of a phase one trade deal will be more political than economic. It will be extensively regarded as a political gesture. China and the US are willing and able to control their huge differences through consultation and negotiation, so that a chain reaction won&#8217;t occur and shake the current world order.</p>
<p>The biggest confusion about this issue from the rest of the world lies in the blurry prospect of China-US relations. From US Vice President Mike Pence to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, many American senior officials express obvious hostility against China, while US President Donald Trump sometimes makes some kind statements to please China. Nevertheless, they are obviously just playing &#8220;good cop, bad cop.&#8221; Many think some American political elites want to help bring about a &#8220;Cold War&#8221; with China. But since that is apparently unpopular in the 21st century, do they really have support in the US?</p>
<p>Trump has never abandoned negotiation with China and the US government has made some practical efforts toward reaching an agreement. Based on this, it appears that radical policies don&#8217;t have uniform support in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington has the motivation to meet Beijing halfway as China seeks to expand its opening-up. American views of China will be tested when Trump runs for re-election next year. That&#8217;s when it will be determined what is most popular among Americans &#8211; the motivation to cooperate with China or the impulse to decouple the two countries&#8217; economies.</p>
<p>Hopefully, a phase one trade agreement can be reached. That would be a mutual success and a tribute to both sides&#8217; rationality. On the contrary, if the other way of thinking dominates China-US relations, both countries will waste time on a dead-end road.</p>

<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />The US economy expanded &#8220;modestly&#8221; from October through mid-November while retailers reported higher costs resulting from tariffs, according to a Federal Reserve survey released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most Districts reported stable to moderately growing consumer spending, and increases in auto sales and tourism were seen across several Districts,&#8221; said the Fed in its latest survey on economic conditions, known as the Beige Book, based on information collected from its 12 regional reserve banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;In manufacturing, more Districts reported an expansion in the current period than the previous one, though the majority continued to experience no growth,&#8221; the survey said.</p>
<p>The survey also showed that retailers reported higher costs from tariffs and firms generally expected higher prices going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firms&#8217; ability to raise prices to cover higher costs remained limited, though a few Districts noted that companies affected by the tariffs were more inclined to pass on cost increases,&#8221; the survey said.</p>
<p>In the Cleveland Fed district, a clothing retailer reduced the use of price discounting to offset higher costs resulting from tariffs. By contrast, a food retailer said that while tariffs had increased costs, the company &#8220;cannot raise prices on a whim&#8221; because of fierce competition.</p>
<p>Business contacts in the Chicago Fed district reported that retail prices &#8220;increased modestly&#8221; and they expected prices to &#8220;rise at a somewhat faster pace&#8221; over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>&#8220;One contact said that food, home goods, and apparel retailers were struggling to pass on higher costs; in contrast, another contact noted that retailers continued to raise prices to reflect higher potential and realized tariffs,&#8221; the survey showed.</p>
<p>In the Richmond Fed district, several retailers also reported that tariffs were raising costs and hurting profit margins, according to the survey.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers and businesses paid an additional 38 billion US dollars in tariffs from February 2018 to September 2019 due to US-China trade disputes, according to Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, a US anti-tariff advocacy group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Economists, analysts and experts across the board agree the tariffs are hurting the economy,&#8221; Jonathan Gold, a spokesperson for Americans for Free Trade, which is a coalition of US businesses, trade organizations and workers against tariffs, said in a statement earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;The manufacturing industry slowed for the third month in a row in October; farm bankruptcies are on the rise; and business investment contracted for the second quarter in a row,&#8221; Gold said, urging the US government to reach a final deal with China that &#8220;removes all tariffs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although the long-lasting China-US trade war has weighed on Chinese exporters over the past year, it turns out the country&#8217;s export-oriented private sector has grown even stronger as tax breaks from the central government and a shift in overseas markets gradually take effect.</p>
<p>Exporters in Yiwu, East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, also known as the shop front of the world&#8217;s factory, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the trade war is no longer a headache for their businesses and they have even seen steady growth in overseas sales and profits recently.</p>
<p>Yang Zhiwei, general manager of Yibing Import and Export Co, which focuses on decorations and accessories, said his businesses saw limited impact from trade war this year, and his company&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1025226.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas</a> orders have even increased compared with 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Orders for<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1032688.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentine&#8217;s Day</a> have been coming in since October,&#8221; Yang said.</p>
<p>Yang expected the company&#8217;s sales in 2019 could reach 10 million yuan ($1.42 million), up 400 percent from last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Yang mentioned the adjustments he made due to the trade war. Now, half of his customers are in Europe, which has overtaken North America as his company&#8217;s largest market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yang&#8217;s turn to Europe also applies to his counterparts in South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province. From January to October this year, trade between Guangdong and the US dropped 6 percent year-on-year, while trade with the EU was up 10.9 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The China-US trade war has led some companies to increase efforts to develop markets in European countries and those that are involved in the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative,&#8221; said Sun Yijiu, CEO of Beijing Wangju Co, which designs websites for e-commerce companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they were expanding and diversifying long before the trade war. So the impact of the trade war on our customers is very limited,&#8221; said Sun.</p>
<p>The company is also getting more customers because of the better-than-expected foreign trade situation. Sun said that he has observed an increasing number of companies that want to turn to overseas business over the past two years.</p>
<p>Cross-border e-commerce trade reached 61.28 billion yuan, up 17.4 percent on a yearly basis, during the first 10 months this year in Yiwu, government data showed.</p>
<p>Latest figures also showed that China&#8217;s small private-sector companies have become an economic stabilizer of the country. From January to October this year, private companies&#8217; profits grew 5.3 percent year-on-year, and small companies&#8217; profits grew 8.8 percent.</p>
<p>Key government support</p>
<p>Yiwu exporters said the central government&#8217;s policy of waiving business taxes on micro-sized and small businesses is one of the major reasons that such enterprises could grow and prosper, posting steady profit growth amid external uncertainties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growing competitiveness of made-in-China products also makes it tough for foreign customers to leave, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese government gives small e-commerce businesses like us a zero-tax policy. Our company spent all of the money that would have gone to taxes on research and development (R&amp;D) last year,&#8221; said Jin Hongbin, the general manager of Yiwu Heyang Plastics Co.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jin told the Global Times on Wednesday that the company could be able to invest about 16 percent of its sales revenue on R&amp;D to improve its innovation and competitiveness.</p>
<p>China has cut taxes for small and micro-sized businesses since the beginning of the year, with the goal of saving them a total of 200 billion yuan annually for three years.</p>
<p>Another Yiwu merchant who has benefited from the tax policy, Mao Xiaochun, product purchasing manager of Yiwu Juding Costume, said that due to the tax cut, sales are expected to reach 250 million yuan this year, up 25 percent on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margins are down a little bit, but there&#8217;s less tax to be paid and overall sales are up. Thus, our profits increase continuously,&#8221; Mao said.</p>
<p>The problem is that talents in Yiwu now could not support our growth, as they prefer large cities like Beijing and Shanghai, Jin said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />A senior Federal Reserve official said Tuesday that he expected US economic growth to &#8220;be weak&#8221; in the fourth quarter of the year as businesses cut inventories due to trade uncertainty.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons the fourth quarter is going to be weak, we believe, is probably a significant inventory adjustment, which might be as much as half a percent or more of GDP growth,&#8221; Robert Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in an interview with U.S. business and financial news network CNBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just means people have been destocking. And probably the reason they were destocking is there was a lot of pessimism over the last number of months about, you know, future growth prospects,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>US economic growth is expected to fall to an annual rate of 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 1.9 percent in the third quarter, according to the latest forecast released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta last week.</p>
<p>The Fed official noted that uncertainty over trade is one of the major reasons that undermine global growth and business investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think weak manufacturing, weak global growth, weak business investment all relate to uncertainty regarding trade. And if that got stabilized, I think we&#8217;d have a chance to see those measures improve,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kaplan believed the &#8220;mid-cycle adjustment&#8221; that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had alluded to this summer is over &#8220;for the time being.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think 1.5 to 1.75 percent on the Fed funds rate is about right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d need to see some material change in the outlook to cause me to want to adjust that rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fed has already lowered interest rates three times since July, amid growing risks and uncertainties stemming from trade tensions, weakness in global growth and muted inflation pressures.</p>

<p>China and the US on Tuesday injected fresh optimism into prospects for a highly anticipated phase one trade agreement, as top trade negotiators of both sides agreed to address remaining issues for the interim deal during a phone conversation.</p>
<p>Coming as speculation intensifies that the two economic powers might not be able to reach the phase one deal soon, the phone call on Tuesday morning underscored the urgency on both sides to defuse trade tensions amid rising political friction, experts noted.</p>
<p>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He held a phone conversation with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday morning to exchange views on how to address each other&#8217;s core concerns, China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> (MOFCOM) said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The two sides] achieved consensus on properly addressing relevant issues and agreed to maintain contact over the remaining issues for the phase one trade agreement,&#8221; according to the statement.</p>
<p>This was the first phone call between the two sides in 10 days and the third since the latest round of face-to-face trade negotiations in Washington in mid-October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was unclear who initiated Tuesday&#8217;s call. Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan and Governor of the People&#8217;s Bank of China Yi Gang also listened in.</p>
<p>Positive signal&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The phone call shows that the two sides are still seriously pushing forward a possible phase one trade agreement, despite noise,&#8221; Li Yong, deputy chair of the expert committee of the China Association of International Trade, told the Global Times on Tuesday, adding that it would be &#8220;unwise&#8221; for the two sides to reverse course for a trade deal because of recent complications.</p>
<p>The phone call came as market expectations for a phase one trade deal faded in recent days over a series of issues, including the US&#8217; attempt to meddle in Chinese internal affairs in Hong Kong and the US Federal Communications Commission&#8217;s move to bar Chinese telecoms providers Huawei and ZTE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such moves have drawn harsh criticism by Chinese officials. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to lodge an official protest against the US Congress&#8217; passage of the so-called Hong Kong human rights and democracy act.</p>
<p>&#8220;The external environment [surrounding the trade talks] is very difficult… but both sides are still trying to overcome the difficulties and strive for a historic signing of [a trade deal],&#8221; said Huo Jianguo, a vice chairman of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, adding both sides need a trade deal to have some &#8220;breathing room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huo said that the signal the officials want to send is that the two sides still have confidence in reaching a deal and &#8220;may have reached certain consensus on the most difficult issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the MOFCOM&#8217;s brief statement did not offer details on what had been discussed during the phone call, an expert close to the trade talks said that topics may have include tariff removals, agricultural purchases, a review mechanism for the implementation of a potential agreement as well as arrangements for a face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>Still despite the positive signs, some Chinese experts stressed that China will stick to its core demands, including proportional removal of existing tariffs and a balanced text of the phase one trade agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ball is in the US&#8217; court,&#8221; said the expert close to the trade talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The listing ceremony of Alibaba&#8217;s Hong Kong debut. /CGTN Photo</p>
<p>Chinese technology behemoth Alibaba made headlines on Tuesday by going &#8220;back home&#8221; with the world&#8217;s largest IPO so far in Hong Kong, in addition to its US listing.</p>
<p>Observers saw Alibaba&#8217;s move as a trend, under which more Chinese companies will list either in Hong Kong or in the A-share market, so as to insulate themselves from being targeted by the US government amid a boiling trade war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re coming back home,&#8221; read the latest post by Alibaba on Weibo on Tuesday, shortly after the company ring the bell to debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company issued 500 million new ordinary shares at an offer price of HK$176 ($22.49) plus 75 million &#8220;greenshoe&#8221; options, aiming to raise HK$88 billion in gross proceeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The comments left under the post are overwhelmed by joy and happiness. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to have you back… and you are not afraid of anything when you&#8217;re at home,&#8221; said one netizen named Shitoudunai.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the escalating trade war, it is natural for Chinese companies to guard against higher political risks incurred by listing in the US and go back to their home market, industry observers said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The US government has adopted a hostile approach on Chinese technology companies. So their listings will be affected if US further badmouths China and blockades those companies,&#8221;Liao Qun, chief economist at China CITIC Bank in Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts predicted that Alibaba&#8217;s home-coming will drive more Chinese technology companies to dual list in both China and the US, a flexible way that enables Chinese enterprises to quit the US market if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington has been waging an all-round trade war against China, under which a number of Chinese high-technology companies are being targeted. US President Donald Trump was also reportedly considering delisting Chinese companies from US stock exchanges, Reuters reported in September.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese companies will be treated more fairly in their home market, while in the US they will be subject to a jaundiced view, because of their national origin,&#8221; Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liao added that US investors do not have a deep understanding of China, including the potential of its technology companies, which means that their market value could be underestimated. &#8220;China&#8217;s capital market is opening up. It is a good option to list in China where investors know your products and technology better,&#8221; Cong said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of February 25, 2019, there were 156 Chinese companies listed on US exchanges with a total market capitalization of $1.2 trillion, according to a statement on the website of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. In addition to Alibaba, other technology giants listed in the US include Baidu and jd.com.</p>
<p>Robert H McCooey, a senior vice president of Nasdaq&#8217;s listing services unit, said at an event in Beijing on Tuesday that the US welcomes Chinese companies to get listed and Nasdaq also welcomes Chinese companies. As there are some rumors in the market, McCooey said he hoped his comment could deliver the right voice.</p>
<p>The timing of his words, coming coincidently with Alibaba&#8217;s mega listing in Hong Kong, shows panic among US business elites and their desire to maintain connections to Chinese companies and the vibrant and innovative Chinese markets, industry observers said. Nasdaq is designed for the listing of technology start-ups and unicorns, while China is an important market to apply innovative technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;US capital markets don&#8217;t want to miss the investment opportunities powered by China&#8217;s rapid technology rise. But if the trade war sees no sign of reaching a truce, the back-flow will happen on a large scale,&#8221; Cong said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chinese and US trade negotiators on Tuesday reached a consensus to properly address the core issues of their respective concerns, and agreed to maintain contact over remaining issues for a phase one trade agreement, China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> (MOFCOM) announced.</p>
<p>The consensus was reached during a phone call between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and the US side, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. The two sides exchanged views on how to address each other&#8217;s core concerns, MOFCOM said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The two sides] achieved consensus on properly addressing relevant issues and agreed to maintain contact over the remaining issues for the phase one trade agreement,&#8221; the statement revealed.</p>
<p>The &#8220;relevant issues&#8221; discussed on the Tuesday phone call may include tariff removal, agricultural purchases and a review mechanism for the implementation of a potential agreement, according to an expert who is closely following the trade talks.</p>
<p>The officials may have also discussed a date for a face-to-face meeting, said the expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two teams have not had a face-to-face meeting since the latest round of negotiations in Washington in mid-October, and have instead relied on phone calls. Media reports last week suggested that officials could hold another round of talks in Beijing.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s phone call came after experts close to the Chinese government told the Global Times on Monday that, despite negative media reports, the two sides were still close to a phase one trade deal with broad consensus having been reached.</p>
<p>The phone call also came as market expectation for a phase one trade deal faded in recent days over a series of issues, including the US trying to meddle in Chinese internal affairs in Hong Kong and the US Federal Communications Commission&#8217;s move to bar Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE. Such moves from the US could complicate the talks, some Chinese experts have said.</p>

<p>Huawei would have become the global No.1 smartphone manufacturer but for US suppression, Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei&#8217;s customer business, said on Monday after the launch conference for the company&#8217;s latest products.</p>
<p>According to Yu, Huawei is not now expecting good news relating to the US restrictions, and is preparing for the worst.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huawei surpassed Apple and stayed in second place in the global market in the third quarter of 2019, according to a report by tech research firm Canalys. Huawei&#8217;s shipments jumped 29 percent year-on-year to 668 million, compared to 435 million for Apple after a 7 percent decrease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some say people are buying our products out of patriotism,&#8221; Yu said. &#8220;But in the four months our products sold really well in the overseas market. Are foreigners also patriotic? They are buying out of love for Huawei&#8217;s products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since last year Huawei has been subject to a series of US restrictions on its business. US company Microsoft only gained a license to export software to Huawei on Thursday, after it was put on the trade blacklist. Huawei&#8217;s latest product, MateBook D, runs the Windows 10 system developed by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a win-win situation, which brings massive commercial benefits to US companies,&#8221; Yu said. &#8220;If we opt for any other solution, it would be a loss for US companies and an inconvenience for consumers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Huawei will launch its 5G-enabled tablet in the first quarter of 2020, which is expected to beat Samsung to become the world&#8217;s first.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s CEO of consumer business Yu Chengdong said on Monday during the company&#8217;s launch conference focusing on its latest tablet, showing that unprecedented attention is being paid to the tablet product line.</p>
<p>A leading company in the development and application of 5G technology, Huawei aims to maintain its competitive edge in the market by rolling out a complete series of new devices, Fu Liang, a Beijing-based telecom industry expert, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Apart from Huawei, South Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics is also rushing to introduce 5G devices, including tablet product Galaxy Tab S6, media reports said.</p>
<p>However, experts said that it&#8217;s hard for Samsung to beat Huawei in the 5G race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, Samsung hasn&#8217;t developed its own processors and still uses baseband processors provided by Qualcomm Inc. In this regard, Samsung&#8217;s research and development speed is still behind that of Huawei,&#8221; Xiang Ligang, a veteran industry analyst told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the available information and Huawei&#8217;s readiness in the technology, the 5G tablet is expected to be released in January,&#8221; Xiang said.</p>
<p>Huawei has become the biggest tablets vendor in China, with a market share of 37.4 percent, according to Yu. Its shipment of tablets increased 24.4 percent year-on-year to about 2.1 million in the third quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>During Monday&#8217;s conference, Huawei launched a new tablet named Matepad Pro, powered by Huawei&#8217;s Kirin 990 processors.</p>
<p>The latest Matepad Pro features a 10.8-inch screen, a dual camera on the back and an attached magnetic keyboard. It also allows synchronization of content among different Huawei gadgets, enabling file transfer with USB wires or switching devices.</p>
<p>Fu said that the latest Matepad Pro will fit more into a business scenario, and will become Huawei&#8217;s next step toward a full range of 5G-enabled devices, from smartphones and tablets to watches.</p>

<p>No stocks tumbling. No capital flight. Hong Kong&#8217;s capital markets have been as solid as a rock despite external interference, especially the passage of a bill by the US Congress that supports<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//content/968898.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hong Kong riot</a>ers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such calm underlines Hong Kong stock market&#8217;s solid foundation, given its high market-oriented level and backbone from the economy in the Chinese mainland, experts commented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s financial markets have &#8220;responded calmly&#8221; and &#8220;operated as usual,&#8221; with a stable currency exchange rate and no signs of strong capital outflows, after the US Congress approved the so-called &#8220;Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act&#8221; last week, wrote Paul Chan Mo-po, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in a blog on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong official went on to criticize the US&#8217; passing of the bill as &#8220;ungrounded,&#8221; saying that the US government should not poke its nose into Hong Kong affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The US has huge economic and other benefits in Hong Kong and has always benefited from the sizable trade surplus it has with Hong Kong. Besides, there are more than 1,300 US corporate branches in Hong Kong,&#8221; he said, adding that the US government should act cautiously to avoid losses by both sides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong rioter-supportive bill was passed by both houses of the US Congress last week and is on the way to the signature of US President Donald Trump, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>It added that the bill requires regular reviews of the city&#8217;s special financial status.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong stock market felt only a ripple from the news despite the sensation it caused in overseas media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s benchmark Hang Seng Index edged down 0.75 percent and 1.57 percent on Wednesday and Thursday, and corrected by 0.48 percent to 26,595.1 points on Friday.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong dollar edged up by 0.02 percent and 0.05 percent against the greenback on Wednesday and Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bill shows the intention of the US to obstruct China&#8217;s development via Hong Kong-related issues. But it is meaningless as the US can&#8217;t change the world&#8217;s optimistic outlook on the prospects of Hong Kong or the mainland,&#8221; Zhang Yi, CEO of Shenzhen-based iiMedia Research, said on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shorting selling meaningless</strong></p>
<p>Experts have condemned any external efforts to crack down on Hong Kong&#8217;s capital markets as being meaningless, stressing that the bourse offers a solid valuation for its listed shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong stock market &#8220;can well represent the shares&#8217; fundamental values, thanks to the high level of marketization and internationalization of the market,&#8221; Li Daxiao, chief economist at Shenzhen-based Yingda Securities, told the Global Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sunday marks the 50th anniversary of the benchmark Hang Seng Index.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s benchmark stock gauge Hang Seng Index has soared by about 16,700 percent from its debut 50 years ago, according to a Bloomberg report on Saturday.</p>
<p>Li particularly mocked the possibility of damaging the Hong Kong economy via short selling on the share market, saying that such hopes are in vain and the fundamental conditions for such a move are missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hong Kong stock market has been seeing increasing liquidity and companies seeking listings from the Chinese mainland. This, plus the Hong Kong stock market&#8217;s strong valuation base, makes the so-called shorting activities very difficult,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been overseas reports about short sellers looking at the Hong Kong stock market to take advantage of the current instable social situation, with the city mired in violence for around half a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a securities analyst surnamed Liang, who is also a Hong Kong stock observer, told the Global Times on condition of anonymity that the number of short deals has decreased on the Hong Kong stock market recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong&#8217;s financial sector has achieved a relatively high margin of safety. The most volatile phase has already passed,&#8221; Liang said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts also noted that the Hong Kong capital market will stand up to external obstruction, given the support it receives from the flourishing mainland economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They made the comments about two days ahead of mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba&#8217;s mammoth secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock market, injecting what is deemed as a much-needed vote of confidence into the riot-hit city and its financial sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;Alibaba&#8217;s Hong Kong listing shows the confidence of not only Alibaba, but global capital, in the city. Otherwise the international shareholders of Alibaba, including those from the US and Japan, wouldn&#8217;t give a nod to the decision,&#8221; Zhang said.&nbsp;</p>
