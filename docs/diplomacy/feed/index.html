<p>The Middle East Security Forum hosted by China has contributed to enhancing peace, security and stability in the region, Mohammed Jassem Al-Sager, chairman of Council for Arab and International Relations and former chairman of the Arab Parliament, told Xinhua in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The forum, held in Beijing on Nov. 27-28, was an important event because of the &#8220;reasonable solutions&#8221; that were offered by China, said Al-Sager, who attended the forum and made a speech.</p>
<p>Themed &#8220;Security in the Middle East under the New Situation: Challenges and Prospects,&#8221; the forum focused on topics including regional fairness and justice, multilateralism, development for security, and dialogue among civilizations.</p>
<p>More than 200 senior officials and experts in the fields of strategy, diplomacy and security from China and the Middle East participated in the forum.</p>
<p>The forum highlighted China&#8217;s attention to the Middle East region and Arab world, Al-Sager said, noting that &#8220;it is a call from China, and the Arab world should respond to this call.&#8221;</p>
<p>China, the second largest economy of the world, is advancing in the technological and financial fields, and &#8220;we need it as an ally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>China is making efforts to promote economic and social development in the Middle East with an aim to achieve peace, security and stability in the region, the Kuwaiti expert noted, adding that he appreciates such efforts and urges the Arab world to extend the hand of friendship to China.</p>
<p>Being a fair country, China can play a role through its stance on the Middle East issues, he said.</p>
<p>On the cooperation between Kuwait and China, Al-Sager said that both countries are cooperating in many areas such as technology and tourism.</p>
<p>&#8220;China can offer proposals and suggestions in this regard,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">US President Donald Trump (R) and Kim Jong Un, top leader of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), meet at the Freedom House, a South Korean building in the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom, June 30, 2019. (Xinhua/NEWSIS)</p>
<p>A Chinese envoy on Wednesday called on the United States and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to move toward each other and resume dialogue and engagement as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Security Council open meeting on the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1055284.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean Peninsula</a>, China&#8217;s Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun said that since the beginning of 2018, there have been positive changes in the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the peninsula issue has been steered back to the right track toward a negotiated solution through dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lately the situation on the Korean Peninsula has taken a twist, leading to renewed tensions between the DPRK and the United States, bringing the peninsula&#8217;s situation to yet another critical juncture,&#8221; said Zhang.</p>
<p>The DPRK has taken a series of positive initiatives on denuclearization, but its legitimate concerns and aspirations in respect of security and development have not been given such attention as is commensurate with its effort, and remain unanswered, said the Chinese ambassador.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an important reason behind the current deadlock in dialogue and the tensing up of the situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zhang said that in the current context, the top priority is to maintain the international consensus and momentum for a political solution to the peninsula issue, support and urge the United States and the DPRK to move toward each other, and &#8220;do everything we can to head off a dramatic reversal of the peninsula&#8217;s situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DPRK and the United States, as the main parties over the peninsula issue, should cherish the hard-won easing of the peninsula&#8217;s situation achieved through dialogue and work together in a practical effort to achieve the denuclearization of, and lasting peace on, the Korean Peninsula, he added.</p>
<p>He said the two parties, especially the United States, should take on board and respect each other&#8217;s concerns in good faith; genuinely demonstrate flexibility and goodwill; act on the consensus contained in the Singapore Joint Statement, and, by taking the phased and synchronized approach, break the deadlock and resume dialogue and engagement as soon as possible, to prevent the dialogue process from &#8220;derailing&#8221; or &#8220;backpedalling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The international community, in particular the main parties to the peninsula issue, must take an objective and impartial position, act in the service of long-term interests and the greater good and make more efforts that contribute to the relaxation of the situation, to the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and consultation and to the peninsula&#8217;s political process, so that the peninsula will not be plunged once again into tensions and confrontations, the Chinese envoy said.</p>
<p>Denuclearization negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since February&#8217;s second summit in Hanoi between the DPRK&#8217;s top leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump ended without a deal. The two leaders first met in Singapore in June 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China&#8217;s<br />
 <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> said Wednesday that a report claiming the country&#8217;s Ambassador to Denmark threatened and tried to pressure the Faroese leader into cooperating with Huawei on 5G was factually wrong, noting that the days when China could not fight back in the face of smears and attacks were gone.</p>
<p>Danish media outlet Berlingske reported Wednesday that China&#8217;s ambassador to Denmark Feng Tie threatened the Faroese prime minister by indicating that a trade agreement would be dropped if the autonomous Danish archipelago did not sign a 5G contract with technology giant Huawei.</p>
<p>Hua Chunying, spokesperson for the ministry said at a press conference that the report has a factual error because China and the Faroe Islands haven&#8217;t reached a free trade agreement, how could the agreement be dropped.</p>
<p>Hua made the remark in response to a foreign journalist&#8217;s question on the report and told the journalist that they could better understand what &#8220;threaten&#8221; means by looking at US officials defaming Chinese companies and threatening other countries not to cooperate with specific Chinese companies.</p>

<p>Hua said China and the Faroe Islands have a good cooperative relationship. The meeting between Feng and Faroese officials was a normal performance of duties, where they talked about the bilateral friendship and cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feng safeguarded the Chinese companies&#8217; legitimate rights and interests, said Hua, noting that the content of the report was wrong and made with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>When a BBC journalist asked if Feng talked about Huawei or possible future cooperation at the meetings with Faroese officials, Hua responded with a series of questions:&#8221;Do you think there is any difference or significance whether the officials talked about Huawei at the meeting? Given that US officials are defaming and attacking China&#8217;s Huawei, can&#8217;t Chinese ambassadors mention Chinese companies&#8217; names when talking about cooperation with officials in the host countries? Do you think China should still be stuck at a time when the US would smear China but the country couldn&#8217;t even talk back?&#8221; Hua noted that such a time was gone and China has the responsibility to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese people and companies.</p>
<p>The US reportedly attempted to force North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies to blacklist Chinese-built 5G technology in the name of cybersecurity at a NATO summit in London on December 3 and 4. But attempts seem to be thwarted. On Wednesday, Telefonica Deutschland decided to pick Nokia of Finland and Huawei to build its 5G network.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Chinese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Zhang Xiao said here on Tuesday that the year 2019 has seen tangible results in the development of Sino-Kazakh relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2019, First President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and (Kazakh) President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev visited China. Tokayev&#8217;s visit lifted the relationship to a permanent comprehensive strategic partnership. This is unprecedented,&#8221; Zhang told reporters from both countries in a group interview.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev was awarded the Friendship Medal of the People&#8217;s Republic of China for his outstanding contributions to the development of Sino-Kazakh relations, the ambassador added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kazakhstan&#8217;s participation in the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai was a complete success,&#8221; Zhang noted. &#8220;Contracts worth 160 million U.S. dollars were signed, which would increase access of Kazakh products to the Chinese market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two-way trade is expected to reach a new record of more than 20 billion dollars in 2019, said Zhang, adding that a number of important industrial and investment projects have also been launched.</p>
<p>&#8220;New impetus has been injected into cultural exchanges. The first Sino-Kazakh film &#8216;The Composer&#8217; gains widespread recognition in both countries,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It won four awards at a recent annual award in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue high-level political dialogues on bilateral relations and on international and regional issues,&#8221; Zhang noted.</p>
<p>He added that bilateral cooperation will focus on the development of relations between young people, think tanks, educational institutions and art groups of the two countries.</p>

<p>High-level officials and experts from China and a dozen developing countries on Wednesday condemned some Western countries for interfering in other countries&#8217; internal affairs under the banner of human rights at a human rights forum in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign officials also called on China to take the lead to redefine the concept of human rights which truly cares about people and amplifies the much-ignored voices of developing nations.</p>
<p>As the US continues to make groundless accusations against China on<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a>-related issues using the excuse of protecting human rights, northwest China&#8217;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region became the focus at the 2019 South-South Human Rights Forum.</p>
<p>The forum held in China&#8217;s capital on Tuesday and Wednesday attracted more than 300 people, including senior officials, scholars and diplomats from over 80 Asian, African and Latin American countries as well as international organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Addressing the forum on Wednesday, Huang Kunming, head of the Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), criticized some countries and politicians who use the &#8220;human rights&#8221; banner to trample on human rights and grossly interfere in other countries&#8217; internal affairs, which seriously violates the international human rights cause.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Past experiences have proven that China has successfully embarked on a human rights development path that conforms to national conditions, which has also contributed to Chinese wisdom to enrich the diversity of human civilization,&#8221; said Huang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.</p>
<p>We regard the right to survive and develop as the primary human rights, Huang said. He called on developing countries to work together to create a diverse human rights development model, improve global human rights governance and make contributions to building a community of shared future for mankind.&nbsp; </p>
<p>China&#8217;s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu said at Wednesday&#8217;s forum that China strongly opposes the country that initiated the trade war and enacted the so-called human rights and democratic act to interfere in another country&#8217;s internal affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remarks came after the US House of Representatives passed the so-called Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, filled with groundless accusations against China&#8217;s Xinjiang policies, on December 3 and the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act&nbsp;on November 27.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ma also lashed out at the country for wielding the stick of sanctions and engaging in economic blockades and technology decoupling. He did not directly name the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These actions hinder world economic development and violate human rights, Ma said.</p>

The two-day forum is hosted by the State Council Information Office and the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/1.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>.

<p>Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry, told Wednesday&#8217;s media briefing that the US today is not qualified to educate China about human rights and morals, in response to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo&#8217;s statement on Monday that &#8220;the Chinese government continues to repress members of religious and ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang, Tibet, and elsewhere, as well as to undermine the freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kongers under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This statement from the US reminded me of Andersen&#8217;s fairy tale, The&nbsp;Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes. There is great irony in it,&#8221; Hua said.</p>
<p>Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Pakistan Senate, said on Wednesday that some Western countries use human rights as a political weapon on Xinjiang or Hong Kong issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We in Pakistan fully stand by China on the issues of Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet and Taiwan. We regret US interference in the internal affairs of China using human rights as a political weapon because this interference is a violation of international laws,&#8221; Sayed said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are also double standards. US-launched wars have destroyed the Middle East, but it still has the nerve to talk of human rights,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sayed has been to Xinjiang 15 times and personally witnessed the tremendous changes in Xinjiang. He praised China&#8217;s efforts to stabilize the region which, he said, is done peacefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bouthaina Shaaban, political and media adviser to the President of Syria, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the Chinese government is doing a very good job in Xinjiang, praising the government&#8217;s work of educating those people about danger of extremism to become better citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaaban stressed that the Xinjiang issue is China&#8217;s internal affairs, which has nothing to do with the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The US uses the human rights claim in many countries to interfere in these countries. It uses this claim in our Arab countries in order to rob our resources, create problems and stop the development of our countries and people. So nobody now believes that the US cares about human rights,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The US is hyping the Xinjiang issue to contain China&#8217;s rise, Shaaban noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China is developing both economically and culturally. China has a different way of dealing with other countries from the US. China respects other civilizations and tries to build connectivity between countries, while the US only uses the economic [weapon] against people and other countries,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts also praised China&#8217;s poverty alleviation work which lifted tens of millions of people out of poverty, and the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative to improve human rights in other countries. </p>
<p><strong>Redefining human rights&nbsp;</p>
<p></strong>Shaaban said it&#8217;s necessary to redefine human rights on the basis of cultural dialogue, equal dignity and integrity, but the problem is that Western countries have been using human rights as a weapon against other countries and to interfere in their domestic affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The West is hypocritical because they do not care at all about human rights. They have punished our people, and prevented us from importing food and medicine for our children,&#8221; Shaaban said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;This forum, I hope, would be the first step toward developing a new concept, a real concept of human rights, which truly cares about human rights and condemns violations of human rights wherever they are, whatever they could be. And I think China is entitled to lead this role,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her opinion was echoed by many other participants.</p>
<p>&#8220;China should promote the meaning of the forum to the West. So far, they have not listened enough to our voices,&#8221; said Lionel Alain Vairon, a senior research member of the Beijing-based think tank Charhar Institute.</p>

<br />Egyptian and Chinese officials hailed on Tuesday the progress in co-building massive skyscrapers in Egypt&#8217;s new administrative capital.</p>
<p>At the construction site, 50 km east of the Egyptian capital Cairo, China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) marked the progress with Egyptian partners in a ceremonial conference attended by officials from the Egyptian Housing Ministry and the Chinese embassy in Cairo.</p>
<p>The CSCEC started in mid-2018 building 20 skyscrapers in the planned new capital&#8217;s Central Business District (CBD).</p>
<p>Chang Weicai, general manager of CSCEC Egypt, told the attendees that the CBD project represents the implementation of both Egypt&#8217;s Vision 2030 and China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI) to seek common development among participating states.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seek to enhance cooperation with all Egyptian partners and join hands to make the CBD project the most beautiful urban construction in Egypt and North Africa,&#8221; Chang said, stressing that CSCEC has been a partner in the modernization process of Egypt since it entered the country over 30 years ago.</p>

<br />Some of the skyscrapers have already risen above the ground, including the Iconic Tower, which is currently standing at 80 meters high but is expected to finally exceed 385 meters to become the tallest tower in Egypt and Africa.</p>
<p>Khaled Abbas, Egypt&#8217;s deputy housing minister, pointed out that the CBD project is going as scheduled, adding that the ministry will start receiving the completed skyscrapers one by one from the second half of 2021.</p>
<p>He said that the Iconic Tower will be fully completed in mid-2022 to mark the completion of the CBD project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s more important than construction is to transfer the Chinese technology and expertise of building such huge towers to Egyptian engineers,&#8221; said the Egyptian minister, noting that about 600 Egyptian engineers and 4,000 Egyptian workers are working on the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Iconic Tower is actually &#8216;iconic&#8217; of the China-Egypt relations and a springboard for further continuous cooperation between the two sides,&#8221; said Ahmed Sallam, undersecretary of Egypt&#8217;s State Information Service.</p>
<p>Sallam, a former media consultant at the Egyptian embassy in China, told Xinhua that the China-Egypt ties are &#8220;distinguished.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the leaderships of both countries share their visions on boosting mutual cooperation and joint development, particularly under China&#8217;s BRI in which Egypt plays an important role.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chinese UN envoy on Monday said Beijing aims to hold a green Winter Olympics in 2022, in which green power will be used in all venues to strive for carbon neutrality.</p>
<p>Zhang Jun, China&#8217;s permanent representative to the UN, reaffirmed the promise during a UN General Assembly debate on sports for development and peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will hold a green Olympic Games and prioritize ecological consideration, resources conservation and environmental friendliness by developing and implementing a low-carbon management work plan,&#8221; Zhang said.</p>
<p>With the work plan, green power will be used in all winter Olympic venues to strive for carbon neutrality, he expounded.</p>
<p>Zhang said China will continue to promote openness in Olympic Games, and through the Beijing games, &#8220;we will strengthen sports cooperation and people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />He pledged China will create a new window for promoting the Olympic spirit and exchanges among civilizations and mutual learnings.</p>
<p>Moreover, China will combat corruption and uphold integrity in hosting the Olympic Games, tighten oversight of the preparations and adopt zero tolerance for doping so that the Beijing Winter Olympic Games will be &#8220;as clean and pure as ice and snow,&#8221; Zhang said.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s meeting focused on sports for development and peace and approved a resolution calling for the Olympic Truce to be implemented for the Tokyo Games in 2020.</p>
<p>The resolution, entitled &#8220;Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal,&#8221; urged UN member states to observe the Olympic Truce &#8220;individually and collectively,&#8221; throughout the period from the seventh day before the start of the Olympic Games until the seventh day following the end of the Paralympic Games.</p>
<p>In particular, it called for ensuring the safe passage, access and participation of athletes, officials and all other accredited persons taking part in the Games, and contributing to the safe organization of the Games.</p>
<p>Further, the resolution decided that the 76th session of the General Assembly, set to start in September 2021, should discuss similar matters for the Olympic Winter Games and the Paralympic Winter Games to be held in Beijing in 2022.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Zhang said the resolution represents the call of justice by all UN member states.</p>
<p>Wishing the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games a success, he urged all member states to act in accordance with the requirements of the resolution by striving to bridge differences, resolve disputes, and stop the use of all military force and hostility during the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>He further said the Olympic Games is not only an arena for athletes, but also a bridge of friendship for people of all countries, noting the modern Olympic Games brings together people of different countries, ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, enhances mutual understanding, promotes social cohesion, and greatly contributes to world peace and development.&nbsp;</p>
