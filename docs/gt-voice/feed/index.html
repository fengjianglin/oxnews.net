<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A sign of the WTO on its headquarters in Geneva Photo: VCG</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Ambassador to the WTO Zhang Xiangchen made an excellent point in dismissing the latest US proposal regarding developing-country status at the fifth General Council meeting this year held on Monday and Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming that there are one or two billionaires in Antigua and Barbuda, which only has a population of 100,000, then the country would be classified as &#8220;high-income,&#8221; but it is by no means a developed country because everyone else is poor, Zhang said.</p>
<p>Whether a country is a developing one is clearly not necessarily measured by the World Bank&#8217;s &#8220;high income&#8221; standards, nor is it up to some in Washington.</p>
<p>At the heart of the US demand for an end to the special and differential treatment for countries designating themselves as developing ones is the intention of challenging China&#8217;s developing-country status and depriving it of its legitimate rights and interests under the WTO rules, regardless of whether China actually meets the standards of a developed country.</p>
<p>It is more crucial than ever for the international community to correctly understand China&#8217;s status as a developing country amid the long-time debate over how to evaluate a country&#8217;s development status. There are more than enough facts and theories that could justify why China is still a developing country and deserves special treatment corresponding to its stage of development.</p>
<p>While China&#8217;s economy has indeed made remarkable achievements, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that China is already a developed country. Generally speaking, China still lags far behind developed countries in terms of economic and social development levels. In 2018, per capita GDP in China was less than $10,000, below the world average. Meanwhile, China&#8217;s urbanization rate for its permanent resident population was 59.58 percent in 2018, while the rate in developed countries is usually around 80 percent. Moreover, there is still a large gap between urban and rural areas and among different regions in China, with prominent wealth inequalities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of the end of 2018, there were still 16.6 million people living below the national poverty line in China. No developing country has ever had such a large economic scale and influence as China, especially at a time when its per capita economic indicators are still low in all respects. This is mainly because China has a population of nearly 1.4 billion, and this large population makes the Chinese economy appear so big.</p>
<p>Although it is not uncommon to see some observers tout and compare China with some developed powers these days, the country should have a clear picture of itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China remains the largest developing country in terms of a wide range of indicators such as per capita levels, industrial structure, employment, innovation ability and balance of development, among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the process of catching up with developed countries, China will not and should not give up its due special treatment, which is the development opportunity granted to developing countries by the multilateral trade rules.</p>

<p>Is the Indian economy heading for a hard landing? The answer to the question, to some extent, will determine the trend of the broad Asian economy in the coming year.</p>
<p>China, India and Japan together generate a considerable part of Asia&#8217;s economic activity. Although Japan&#8217;s economy expanded in the third quarter at a faster-than-estimated rate of 1.8 percent, it is too early to say the economy will recover strongly in the coming year. Japan&#8217;s economy is still struggling with stubborn deflation and slow growth. It&#8217;s hard to expect Japan to become an engine of Asian economic growth in the coming year.</p>
<p>India has emerged as an Asian economic superpower in the past few years. China and India will be the key drivers of growth for the Asian economy in 2020. However, unfortunately, both economies face downward pressure.</p>
<p>Some observers forecast China&#8217;s GDP growth may fall below 6 percent next year. Even if this scenario becomes a reality, the country will still be the top contributor to Asian GDP growth in the near term. The 6-percent figure is just a psychological mark that&#8217;s of little practical significance. Growth of 6.1 percent or 5.9 percent in China makes no big difference for the Asian economy.</p>
<p>The major uncertainty for the Asian economy will come from India. The economy is at risk of a hard landing. India&#8217;s annual GDP growth fell to a shocking 4.5 percent in the third quarter. What&#8217;s next? The country&#8217;s economy is facing the toughest times since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014.</p>
<p>If the Indian economy continues to slow, market confidence in Modi&#8217;s management will be tested. The most urgent task for his administration is curbing the downturn and restoring confidence in the market.</p>
<p>Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said recently the current economic slowdown is &#8220;temporary&#8221; and a result of the ongoing trade war between the US and China, according to Indian news agency PTI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trade war may indeed be taking a toll on India&#8217;s economy, but India needs to look inward at its deep-rooted problems, instead of blaming the trade dispute between China and the US.</p>
<p>The pro-reform Modi administration did a good job in recent years in propping up the economy. Hopefully, the Modi economic miracle can continue in the coming years &#8211; otherwise, the Asian economy may be in for a bumpy road next year.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo:Xinhua</p>
<p>It has been 18 months since the US began imposing 25 percent tariffs on the first tranche of Chinese goods, and bilateral trade between the world&#8217;s two largest economies is still sliding. The General Administration of Customs showed that China&#8217;s trade with the US fell 11.1 percent year-on-year to 3.4 trillion yuan ($483 billion) in the first 11 months of this year, widening from a 10.6-percent decline in the first 10 months.</p>
<p>Even with a &#8220;phase one&#8221; trade deal, the downtrend in bilateral trade will be difficult to reverse. Meanwhile, China&#8217;s total trade actually expanded 2.4 percent year-on-year in the first 11 months, indicating that trade with the US is not irreplaceable for China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the tariff war dragged on, Chinese companies sought new suppliers from other countries and explored the sales potential of the domestic market. Their hard work explains why China&#8217;s trade with its major partners (except the US) showed marked gains during the first 11 months &#8211; enough to make up for the decline in China-US trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, in the January-November period, China&#8217;s trade with the EU, the country&#8217;s largest trading partner, jumped 7.7 percent. Trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the No.2 partner, rose 12.7 percent.</p>
<p>Some in Washington may claim that the US has finally managed to narrow its trade deficit with China, as customs data showed that China&#8217;s trade surplus with the US hit 1.88 trillion yuan in the first 11 months, narrowing 3 percent on a yearly basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is true that a trade war could affect US-China trade and reduce the US trade deficit with China to a certain extent, but as long as Americans maintain low savings, the country&#8217;s overall trade deficit won&#8217;t change. Instead, some of the deficit with China will turn into deficits with other countries like India and Vietnam.</p>
<p>As for US consumers, they are bound to bear higher costs, regardless of whether manufacturers in China stay put or move production out of China under US tariff pressure. It&#8217;s impossible for the US to benefit from such industrial transfers as virtually no price-sensitive manufacturing work will go back to America.</p>
<p>In addition, the trade war is rearranging the global supply chain by affecting the global trade environment. This development is beyond the control and expectations of the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, regarding the industrial chain in East Asia, China used to import intermediate goods from Japan and South Korea, and assemble them into finished consumer goods for export to the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, as China exports less to the US amid the trade war, it also imports less from Japan and South Korea. Customs data showed that from January to November, China&#8217;s imports from Japan fell 2.4 percent and those from South Korea dropped 12.9 percent.</p>
<p>So the rest of the world will have to restructure their industries and prepare for the reorganization of the world&#8217;s value chain as result of the US-triggered tariff war.</p>

<p>Investors are closely watching the US non-farm payrolls report for November that is scheduled to be released on Friday. However, the reading is less significant than before as an indicator of US economic activity, thanks to the prolonged trade war with China.</p>
<p>The US unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in October, and the Labor Department reported that the US economy added 128,000 jobs for the same period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some analysts have estimated that November&#8217;s non-farm payrolls will rise by 190,000, as the return of about 45,000 striking General Motors workers helped support the number. US President Donald Trump may once again brag about the US economy, with record-low unemployment rates. However, the employment picture in the US is perhaps less rosy than those figures suggest.</p>
<p>The agricultural sector is one of the hardest-hit industries in the trade war with China, but job losses in the sector aren&#8217;t reflected by the non-farm payrolls report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mix of lower employment and lower incomes is brewing in US agricultural sector. The upcoming non-farm payrolls report isn&#8217;t a good window on the impact of the trade war on the employment picture in the US.</p>
<p>More importantly, the non-farm payrolls report cannot reflect changes in the employment structure. The Voice of America (VOA) has reported that jobs for middle-class Americans continue to shrink, though positions at the top and bottom of the pay scale are growing. The US economy indeed keeps adding jobs, but the quality of those jobs is declining. The VOA report said the fastest-growing segment of the job market for non-university-educated workers is in personal care and services occupations. Even if there&#8217;s a rapid increase in November&#8217;s non-farm payrolls figure, this can hardly be taken as evidence that the economy will gain steam rather than lose its luster.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to calculate the impact of the trade war on the US jobs market, especially jobs in the manufacturing sector. Economic indicators released recently showed that the US manufacturing sector contracted for four months as of November as the trade war took a toll on US factories. While the manufacturing sector keeps shrinking, there are also fewer US manufacturing jobs than expected.</p>
<p>The trade war and tariffs will do more harm than good in driving job creation in the US. The non-farm payrolls report is always one of the most eagerly awaited economic indicators offering a window to observe the world&#8217;s largest economy, but now it is less significant. Amid the trade war, we need a new index to observe the US job markets.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The logo of China&#8217;s tech giant Huawei. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>It seems that Huawei faces an endless list of tests, with the latest media report suggesting that the Trump administration may go further to place the Chinese technology giant on its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, restraining its access to the US financial system.</p>
<p>If this sanction is really imposed on Huawei, which has a massive trading network, then from the perspective of US-China relations and the global financial chain, it would mean a substantial decoupling between the world&#8217;s two largest economies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global industrial chain would be restructured as a result, with both Chinese and American companies suffering.</p>
<p>Financial sanctions on Huawei may only be a possibility at present, but the mere existence of such possibility is already bound to trigger more difficulties and challenges for the Chinese company, because other institutions may reduce or end doing business with it due to fear of being implicated.</p>
<p>Though Huawei may have foreseen the most serious sanctions coming its way and made relevant preparations, the impact will still inevitably be huge. Unlike general economic sanctions that have a certain impact on trade, financial sanctions target the foundation of global trade &#8211; payments and settlements, which usually inflict devastating damage on a company or a country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deterrent power of American financial sanctions comes from US financial hegemony, which is hard to shake in the short term. Financial hegemony is such a powerful weapon that the US will unlikely keep it only for Huawei, so there&#8217;s a high possibility that other Chinese companies or banks could become future targets.</p>
<p>It is essential for China to be prepared to guard against different levels of financial sanctions from the US. First, Chinese authorities need to protect relevant institutions and companies from being involved in any incidents or trouble that may escalate and lead to financial sanctions.</p>
<p>Second, China needs to speed up the establishment of a new settlement system for global trade or join forces with some European countries on this issue. For instance, after six EU countries declared that they would join the INSTEX mechanism for trade with Iran, China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Tuesday that China hopes the mechanism could soon cover more areas and open up to non-EU countries as third parties.</p>
<p>Third, the abuse of dollar-based financial hegemony has actually accelerated the de-dollarization process. During this process, China should continue its push for the yuan&#8217;s internationalization. When it comes to trade and investment where China has bargaining power, it should encourage more use of yuan-denominated pricing and settlement.</p>
<p>Fourth, the technological revolution may help expand China&#8217;s influence on global payment and monetary systems. This is why the Chinese central bank is making all-out efforts to roll out its own digital currency electronic payment system, with the aim of becoming a bellwether in cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A woman tastes wine during the 11th &#8220;Vinifest&#8221; Wine Festival in Beirut, Lebanon, on Oct. 3, 2018.

<p>It seems that US President Donald Trump couldn&#8217;t wait to open new battlefronts in the global trade war in an aim to lift the country&#8217;s slowing economy. Trump tweeted on Monday that he would restore steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina due to their currency depreciations. The same day also saw the administration threaten tariffs as high as 100 percent on up to $2.4 billion worth of French products as a retaliation against France&#8217;s digital tax.</p>
<p>The president may sincerely think that waving a tariff stick can win more benefits for American people, but he is likely to inflict more damage on the US economy in the process of destabilizing the system of global trade.</p>
<p>Using tariffs as a weapon is a terrible way to achieve any trade or political goal. It is not the first time for the president to initiate a tariff war against its trading partners in the name of protecting national interests, which usually ended up with outcomes like increased prices, hindered growth, and a heavier burden on taxpayers in the US.</p>
<p>As showed by the China-US trade war, tariffs didn&#8217;t bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, although some manufacturers did leave China for Southeast Asian countries. According to the Institute for Supply Management, US manufacturing actually slipped for the fourth consecutive month in November, with new orders, production and hiring all dropping.</p>
<p>Under WTO rules, a country is allowed to use tariffs when its interests are seriously hurt, but that shouldn&#8217;t be the excuse for the abuse of tariffs over any trade fight. For decades, the US government made great efforts to build a US-oriented global trade system, but now by introducing a flurry of protectionist measures, the US itself is tearing a hole in the old trade system by giving other countries the excuse to do the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of making a better deal through imposing tariffs is misguided, and it will only isolate the US from its trading partners and encourage retaliation instead of doing any good to its economy. In recent years, America&#8217;s lead in unilateralism has already upset and angered many of its allies, weakening the united front of the US-centered trade system. Some allies like Japan tried to establish their own trade network by signing free trade agreements with their trading partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, Japan and the EU signed a free trade agreement last year, which came into force as of February 1, 2019. Japan has also ratified the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement signed by 11 countries including several US allies.</p>
<p>The Trump administration may think it is able to rebuild a US-centered web of trade agreements in the future, but the question is whether it will be as dominant as it once was in the new system.</p>

<p>Some economists forecast China&#8217;s economic growth may fall below 6 percent next year. These forecasts come as the global economy sees stagnation with weak growth in some nations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if China&#8217;s year-on-year growth dips below 6 percent in 2020, the country won&#8217;t be the world&#8217;s worst-performing major economy. GDP growth of less than 6 percent would still be within a reasonable and bearable range for the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s slowdown is a fact, but the economy is running smoothly as a whole. The Chinese government can pull the economy out of its downturn and keep the growth rate at 7 percent, assuming that a strong stimulus program is carried out. However, the Chinese government has not done so. Why? That&#8217;s because the current growth rate can help China meet its goals of improving living standards while also safeguarding economic stability. This situation allows the government to focus more on economic restructuring, which in turn lays a foundation for long-term economic growth.</p>
<p>The outside world has always scrutinized China&#8217;s GDP figures and often read too much into them. It&#8217;s understandable, because many outside observers have little knowledge about the Chinese economy. They have to resort to indicators such as GDP figures to know what&#8217;s happening in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. Some of those people evaluate the performance of China&#8217;s economy based on rises and falls in the GDP figure, but that&#8217;s a simplistic means of analysis.</p>
<p>As for China, GDP is being seen as a less important metric of economic performance. The nation&#8217;s rapid alleviation of poverty in recent decades means there is less pressure on the country to rely on fast GDP growth to raise the incomes of poor people. Currently, China&#8217;s economic concerns involve solving certain problems, such as hedging financial risks and encouraging independent innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The country faces many problems in search of solutions, but it seems the top priority of the Chinese government isn&#8217;t about keeping the economic growth from slipping below 6 percent. China has repeatedly emphasized that the economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development. But unfortunately, many in the outside world don&#8217;t understand the shift very well.</p>
<p>China has been moving in this direction and will continue on this path. However, it is undeniable that the trade war with the US adds uncertainty to the Chinese economy. China&#8217;s GDP figures have been in the media spotlight, and any change in the reading will influence the public opinion war and confidence in the Chinese economy. China&#8217;s GDP figures have drawn more Western attention amid the trade war, so the figures to some extent will bear more significance in 2020.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy has become a complex system. The wisdom of Chinese people will be tested in deciding how to strike a balance among goals such as 6 percent GDP growth and economic restructuring. China is under pressure to safeguard its economic growth, but it&#8217;s unlikely to return to the old path of relying on massive stimulus.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>The Modi government deserves some credit for attempting to push ahead with its largest privatization program in more than a decade. The sale of majority stakes in India&#8217;s state companies is said to be part of its reform effort, with the aim of raising funds to reduce the budget deficit, as well as luring foreign investment and boosting its economy.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Modi government has rolled out reforms aimed at privatizing state-owned companies, which will have a positive impact on the Indian economy in the long run despite the current challenges and resistance.</p>
<p>Yet, the path of reform will not be easy for India, which aims to build the country into an attractive manufacturing destination for foreign businesses. Manufacturing competitiveness cannot be simply improved by selling stakes. Market opening-up is also essential but implementation in this regard is far from simple.</p>
<p>While some say that India&#8217;s economy has greater openness than China&#8217;s, there is a huge gap between China and India when it comes to attracting foreign investment. That&#8217;s not determined just by opening-up policies &#8211; it also requires other supporting factors like infrastructure, logistics and the quality of the labor force. In 2018, foreign direct investment (FDI) in India reached $42 billion, while China received FDI worth a record $139 billion, according to a UN report released in June.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s latest privatization efforts just mark an important step toward its opening-up goal. There is still far to go when it comes to improving its industrial manufacturing ability. It&#8217;s no secret that problems with its tax policies, land system and labor issues have always been considered the key factors restraining the country&#8217;s economic reform and development. Implementation of any unified reform is difficult due to the country&#8217;s demographic and political diversity.</p>
<p>What is happening in India also occurred in China decades ago. Take the textile industry as an example. When China took a full-scale opening-up approach to its textile sector, businesses from developed countries and regions began to enter China, bringing capital, advanced technology and management concepts, which greatly promoted the reform of state-owned textile enterprises at that time. By the end of the last century, China&#8217;s textile industry had an obvious comparative advantage in the world market. Just like what happened with China during reform and opening-up, the influx of foreign investment will help address some of India&#8217;s weaknesses and develop its manufacturing sector. But the process will be difficult, and India&#8217;s own efforts in continuous reform and opening-up are also indispensable.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo:Xinhua</p>
<p>Some Philippine senators may appear to be concerned about the security of their national energy grid after an internal report revealed that the Chinese government has the &#8220;full capability to disrupt national power systems.&#8221; In fact, they are only spoiling the atmosphere for developing the Philippines&#8217; much-needed infrastructure project, harming the overall interests of the country and its people as a whole.</p>
<p>The internal report, leaked by an unidentified source to CNN, is actually making much ado about nothing by raising concerns that are only theoretically possible. And then some lawmakers who have long been biased against China are making a fuss about the so-called flick of a switch, disregarding the fact that there is no reason and no need for China to take such a move.</p>
<p>In fact, the remote control system, which allegedly could be used to switch off the power grid, is only designed for remote troubleshooting so as to ensure the normal operation of the power supply. Power grids in Kenya, Indonesia and Thailand also use the same remote control system, according to media reports.</p>
<p>While there is no evidence to suggest or prove concerns over China&#8217;s interference in the Philippine power grid, some people in the Philippines never tire of hyping such worries over Chinese companies taking control of the Philippines&#8217; power system. Currently, State Grid Corp of China (SGCC) owns a 40 percent stake in the National Grid Corp of the Philippines, a private consortium that has run the country&#8217;s power lines since 2009.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on certain infrastructure construction and economic development, some Philippine politicians are creating obstacles for the country&#8217;s power supply development. It is their people who would end up paying the cost if the energy grid cooperation was disrupted by such a dirty political plot.</p>
<p>The investment made by SGCC in the Philippines is a demonstrative project for commercial cooperation between China and the Philippines. Over the years, Chinese companies have brought capital and advanced technology to the Philippines, improving the stability and reliability of the latter&#8217;s power grid operation and thus benefiting its ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>In particular, SGCC also launched the charitable &#8220;Brighten Up&#8221; project to bring electricity to remote villagers in the Southeast Asian country. In June this year, two Chinese-funded solar power stations were officially completed and handed over to Philippine authorities, according to the Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>It is such a pity that some Philippine politicians only care about their own political tricks and fail to see the good that Chinese companies brought to their people&#8217;s lives.</p>

<p></font>By seeking a legislative ban on investment in China, hardliners in Washington are actually blocking the Federal Thrift Retirement Investment Board (FTRIB) from pursuing investment decisions in its best interests, which will only see a backlash from financial markets.</p>
<p>After the federal pension fund indicated last week that it intends to press on with plans to shift billions of dollars to an index fund that includes some Chinese A shares, a group of politicians in Washington are still pushing a bipartisan bill that would force the federal retirement fund to change its mind.</p>
<p>The move clearly conflicts with the guidelines of the FTRIB, which is designed to offer federal employees a retirement plan similar to private employers&#8217; 401(k) plans with assets of nearly $600 billion under the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is neither appropriate nor reasonable to deprive the federal retirement fund of an investment choice that is available to its peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implications of the discriminatory legislation can&#8217;t be underestimated. The move seems like nothing but an attempt to sever Wall Street&#8217;s ties to the Chinese market. This approach of politicizing rational financial investment decisions is clearly against the laws of economic and financial development, and it will only harm the interests of TSP participants in the end.</p>
<p>For any farsighted investors, the value of China&#8217;s A shares has become so clear these days given, the relatively low valuations on the Chinese mainland stock markets, especially as US stocks keep rising to record highs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, a growing preference for the Chinese capital market could be totally justified based on recent studies and investment research papers from around the world.</p>
<p>Moreover, the continued opening-up of China&#8217;s financial sector is the opportunity global investors can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t miss when it comes to sharing the country&#8217;s development dividends. For instance, foreign ownership limits for futures, mutual funds and securities firms will all be removed next year to welcome global investors including the TSP and other American retirement funds to better tap the Chinese market.</p>
<p>It would be regrettable in the end if the TSP changes its decision under political pressure in Washington. After all, a growing number of foreign institutions are interested in and bullish on investment opportunities in China&#8217;s equities markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to media reports, a number of pension funds from Australia, Sweden and Canada have had portfolios in A shares through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors program. It is believed that with the expansion of investment channels, A shares will become more and more attractive to foreign institutional investors.</p>
