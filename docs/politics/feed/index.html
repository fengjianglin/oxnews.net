<br />The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held a meeting Friday to analyze and study the economic work for 2020 and make plans for improving conduct and building integrity as well as fighting corruption.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Facing the complicated situation of rising risks and challenges both at home and abroad this year, China has maintained sustained and sound economic and social development, said the meeting.</p>
<p>Major steps have been taken in reform and opening-up with deepened supply-side structural reform, and breakthroughs have been made in scientific and technological innovation, the meeting noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The year 2020 will be the year to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and it is also the final year for the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/972044.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13th Five-Year Plan</a>. China shall achieve its first centenary goal,&#8221; said the meeting.</p>
<p>It called for taking Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as a guide and working hard to ensure the tasks are well completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The basic trend of steady long-term growth for China&#8217;s economy remains unchanged at present and for a period to come,&#8221; the meeting said, stressing transforming external pressure into motivation for deepening reform and furthering opening-up, and focusing on running China&#8217;s own affairs well.</p>
<p>Stressing the policy framework of keeping macroeconomic policies stable and microeconomic policies flexible, and ensuring social policies cover people&#8217;s basic needs and welfare of the disadvantaged, the meeting underscored preemptive, targeted and effective macroeconomic control and adoption of countercyclical adjustment tools.</p>
<p>The meeting emphasized further efforts in building a modern economic system, strengthening the high-quality development of agriculture, manufacturing and tertiary industries, and enhancing science and technology prowess and innovation capacity, as well as deepening reforms in the economic system to achieve a higher level of opening-up.</p>
<p>The meeting called for turning the institutional strength of the Party leading the economy work into more effective governance as underlined in the fourth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the CPC.</p>
<p>Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the National Supervisory Commission and their local organs have strengthened their supervisory duties, implemented the eight-point decision on improving Party and government conduct, taken action against the practice of formalities for formalities&#8217; sake and bureaucratism, and conducted political inspection and rectification, said the meeting.</p>
<p>It said efforts have been intensified to address corruption that occurs on people&#8217;s doorsteps, and to consolidate the sweeping victory in the fight against corruption.</p>
<p>Efforts have also been made to deepen reform of the disciplinary inspection and supervision system and build a contingent of anti-corruption officials who are loyal to the Party, have moral integrity and demonstrate a keen sense of responsibility, the meeting noted.</p>
<p>The fourth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee has made new requirements on promoting full and rigorous governance over the Party.</p>
<p>The meeting called for the disciplinary inspection and supervision work to strengthen checks on and oversight over the exercise of power, comprehensively promote the system under which officials &#8220;don&#8217;t dare to, are unable to and have no desire to commit acts of corruption,&#8221; and train a competent and professional disciplinary inspection team to safeguard the realization of the first centenary goal.</p>
<p>At an earlier meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Xi was briefed on the CCDI&#8217;s work in 2019 and preparations for the commission&#8217;s upcoming fourth plenary session, scheduled for Jan. 13 to 15, 2020.</p>

<p>China on Friday said it had taken &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; measures on US diplomats in the country. </p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a press conference that the Chinese side issued a note to the US Embassy in China on Wednesday, informing it of reciprocal measures going into immediate effect. </p>
<p>Hua made the remarks when asked to respond to reports that China had taken countermeasures in response to the previous restrictions imposed on Chinese diplomatic and consular officials posted in the United States. </p>
<p>In October, the United States ordered Chinese diplomats to notify the State Department in advance of any official meetings with US diplomats, local or municipal officials and before any visits to colleges or research institutions. </p>
<p>Asked to confirm reports that US diplomats in China are required to notify the Foreign Ministry five working says in advance of meetings with local officials, Hua said, the countermeasures &#8220;are reciprocal to the US State Department&#8217;s restrictive measures against Chinese diplomatic and consular officials.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;We once again urge the US side to correct its mistake, withdraw the decision and provide support and convenience for Chinese diplomatic and consular officials posted in the United States as they fulfill their official duties,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Hua said China has always supported diplomatic and consular personnel from other countries, including the United States, in carrying out normal official duties according to law. </p>
<p>&#8220;We will take appropriate measures in response to US actions,&#8221; she said.</p>

<br />China&#8217;s first documentary on its overall counter-terrorism efforts in<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> aired Thursday night prompted wide discussions among the audience with never-before-seen scenes of terrorism, which highlighted the hefty price China has paid and the country&#8217;s resolve to eradicate terrorism.</p>
<p>Video and audio clips in the English-language documentary were shown for the first time as evidence of the horrible crimes wrought by terrorists in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It also showed interactions between terrorists and overseas masterminds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nearly one hour-long documentary, &#8220;Fighting Terrorism in Xinjiang,&#8221; which was streamed on CGTN, China&#8217;s state broadcaster, has four parts. It begins with the evolution of extremism in Xinjiang, followed by the fight against terrorism. It also illustrated the interactions of terrorists and overseas forces accompanied by audio and video evidence. The documentary ends by highlighting international cooperation on counter-terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zheng Liang, a research fellow at Guangdong-based Jinan University, who studied Xinjiang for more than 10 years, told the Global Times that he felt &#8220;shocked&#8221; after viewing the documentary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zheng said that previous videos on Xinjiang&#8217;s counter-terrorism were not as specific and well-edited as the Thursday one. &#8220;This newly released documentary uses quite different visual language adopted by mainstream media.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The authorities did not publish the video and details of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang before out of concern they may cause panic. This proves China had paid a high price in fighting terrorism, and the international community should have a clear understanding of this,&#8221; Li Wei, a counter-terrorism expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Li noted that the video and audio footage justify China&#8217;s Xinjiang policies in countering terrorism, including launching the vocational education and training centers, which have been highly effective in de-radicalizing and fighting extremist forces.</p>
<p>The beginning of the documentary features the landscape of Xinjiang, its culture and the different ethnic groups in China, including the prosperous markets and people&#8217;s peaceful and happy lives. Then the scene shifts to depicting the threat of terrorism that wrought havoc in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Global threat</span></strong></p>
<p>Xinjiang has long been the main battlefield of countering terrorism. According to incomplete data, from 1990 to 2016, Xinjiang endured thousands of terrorist attacks that killed large numbers of innocent people and hundreds of police officers.</p>
<p>The documentary features video footage of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, including one in Yining, Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture in 1997, which left seven dead and 198 injured; the Urumqi riots on July 5, 2009, which caused 197 deaths and over 1,700 injuries; and the 2013 Seriqbuya attack in Kashi, which left 15 dead and two wounded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terrorists also orchestrated attacks in other cities of China: ramming a car into a crowd in Tiananmen Square in 2013, and another attack that struck the Kunming railway station on March 1, 2014, that left 31 dead and 141 wounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police officers in Xinjiang work on the frontline of the fight against terrorism. According to data from China Central Television, from 2013 to 2016, a total of 127 police officers in Xinjiang sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.</p>
<p>Experts believe terrorism is a global threat, and no country can win the war against terrorism on its own. In the face of the threat of terrorism and extremism, Xinjiang has taken a series of measures, including establishing laws and regulations, and launching effective counter-terrorism operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to media reports found by the Global Times, the Xinjiang region launched a special counter-terrorism campaign in May 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities have cracked down on 1,588 terrorist groups, and 12,995 terrorists and 2,052 explosive materials had been seized in Xinjiang since 2014, read a white paper on regional work on counter-terrorism, de-extremism and human rights protection in March.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Chinese national political advisors convened a bi-weekly seminar on Thursday to discuss addressing problems in developing compensation mechanisms for ecological conservation. </p>
<p>The seminar, held by the National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China&#8217;s top political advisory body, was presided over by Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. </p>
<p>Wang called for efforts to improve related policies and step up investments, and stressed both the government&#8217;s leading role and social participation in establishing a Chinese-style policy system for eco-compensation that fits the country&#8217;s conditions. </p>
<p>A total of 12 political advisors, experts and scholars put forward their suggestions, while over 160 political advisors voiced their opinions via a mobile platform. </p>
<p>They noted that since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, a lot of explorations have been carried out for eco-compensation mechanisms, and the policy framework has been established. </p>
<p>Some problems still need to be addressed, including the imperfect laws and regulations in the area and a lack of funding channels, according to the political advisors. </p>
<p>Political advisors proposed advancing legislation concerning eco-compensation mechanisms to better define the principles, areas, scope, subjects, standards and funding sources of the compensation and the rights and responsibilities of stakeholders. </p>
<p>They also proposed setting up more market-oriented and diversified eco-compensation mechanisms and strengthening trans-departmental information sharing and trans-regional coordination.</p>

<p>Chinese experts said on Tuesday that the US attempt to force North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies to blacklist Chinese-built 5G technology in the name of cybersecurity will fail as it violates the allies&#8217; national interests and their needs for updated technology.</p>
<p>The US will reportedly discuss the alleged threats posed by China, including its dominance of 5G telecommunications networks, as US President Donald Trump meets allies at a NATO summit in London on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s rising military, economic and technological power might be discussed at the summit, Reuters said.</p>
<p>Chinese observers said the US side has been hyping threats and challenges to NATO and would force allies to pick sides between China and the US by blocking 5G networks developed by Chinese companies in their countries.</p>
<p>Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times that the US attempts would go bankrupt as the adoption of 5G technology, a technological trend at which Chinese companies excel, is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Xiang said that Chinese telecom equipment makers like ZTE and Huawei have an edge in developing 5G terminal devices and infrastructure over their global competitors. In adopting Chinese 5G, the allies could cut costs, he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no good substitute for the technology in the Western counties, which means NATO allies will have no other choice but to select Huawei eventually,&#8221; Xiang said.</p>
<p>Shen Yi, a professor at Shanghai-based Fudan University, told the Global Times that US attempts would fail as allies would first weigh their own national interest and technology needs and then their relations with the US.</p>
<p>Shen noted that the US is losing its dominance in NATO after the US media outlet CNBC reported Monday that the organization&#8217;s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg insisted the military alliance did not want to &#8220;create new adversaries.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shen said that US attempts are based more on the political intention to contain China&#8217;s development and so it hypes the alleged cyber-security threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper warned NATO allies in a speech in September at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency summit in Maryland that using 5G networks developed by Chinese companies &#8220;jeopardizes military interoperability and intelligence sharing opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with The Economist in September, Ren Zhengfei, CEO of Shenzhen-based Huawei, said he was ready to share the 5G technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report said the buyer could modify the source code, meaning that neither Huawei nor the Chinese government would have even hypothetical control of any telecoms infrastructure built using equipment produced by the new company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More countries, even some European countries, have begun to reject calls from the US. After Germany said it planned to allow Huawei to build 5G networks, the UK became the next major power in Europe likely to embrace Huawei.</p>

<br />The Hong Kong-related act recently passed by the US Congress and signed into law by the US president is &#8220;completely unnecessary and unjustifiable,&#8221; Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At a media briefing before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lam said the HKSAR government strongly opposes the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, and regards it as a &#8220;very regrettable&#8221; move by a foreign legislature and administration to interfere in the Hong Kong affairs through their own legislation.</p>
<p>Stressing that the human rights and freedom of Hong Kong residents are well protected by the HKSAR Basic Law, Lam pointed out &#8220;we enjoy a high degree of freedom in many aspects, including freedom of press, freedom of assembly and demonstration, as well as religious freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lam noted that the major chambers of commerce here have been strongly opposing the act, adding that the act may even bring harm to US companies, considering that there are more than 1,300 US enterprises that have operation or even regional headquarters in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As for the suspension of reviewing applications to visit Hong Kong by US military ships and aircraft and the sanctions against some US non-governmental organizations announced by the Chinese central government on Monday, Lam said the central government shall be responsible for the foreign affairs related to the HKSAR, and the HKSAR will cooperate and follow up in accordance.</p>
