<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Dong Desheng is featured in a China Central Television program wearing an ethnic Russian costume. Photo: Courtesy of Dong Desheng</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a foreigner?&#8221; Dong Desheng is often asked this on his travels to other cities in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Chinese,&#8221; he always patiently replies.</p>
<p>With blue eyes, golden hair and fair skin, 44-year-old Dong, a farmer who has gained popularity on streaming platforms Kuaishou and Douyin, is an ethnic Russian, one of China&#8217;s 56 officially recognized ethnic groups, living in Xunke county, Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has 1.5 million followers on Kuaishou and 700,000 on Douyin, where fans call him &#8220;Uncle Petrov.&#8221;</p>
<p>He appreciates China&#8217;s policies that protect and unify ethnic groups, crediting them for making his Russian heritage celebrated by such a large fan base.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Anger toward CNN</strong></span></p>
<p>At first, Dong did not want to be interviewed when reached by the Global Times. &#8220;I was so angry after reading the CNN report after they interviewed me. Although I cannot read English, my friend translated it for me,&#8221; Dong told the Global Times, adding that the report deliberately denigrates China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article titled &#8220;&#8216;Uncle Petrov&#8217; is the ethnic Russian streaming star making China question what it means to be Chinese&#8221; was published by CNN on June 24.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dong said he feels that his story was wrongly made use of by CNN to criticize China&#8217;s ethnic policies.</p>
<p>During his telephone interview with CNN, Dong said that he is Chinese and that he loves his country, he told the Global Times. &#8220;I appreciate the efforts that the government made for the unity of ethnic groups. So I was irritated when I knew CNN criticized China&#8217;s ethnic policy in the latter part of the same report,&#8221; Dong said.</p>
<p>The CNN report also makes use of his story to discuss &#8220;what it means to be &#8220;Chinese&#8221; in a society where &#8220;ethnic homogeneity and social conformity are the norm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dong said it was his family&#8217;s own choice to learn and practice Han culture in life. He and his family have never been forced to change lifestyle by anyone.</p>
<p>His grandfather&#8217;s earliest memories were all about running away from war until 8 years old when he came to China. The grandfather was grateful that China provided a stable home for him, therefore he wanted the whole family to speak Chinese.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one forced our family to abandon the Russian characteristics, and it was the private choice of my grandfather,&#8221; Dong said.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Born and raised in China</strong></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am a real Chinese. I speak northeastern Chinese dialect but not Russian,&#8221; Dong emphasized. He is seven-eighths ethnic Russian and one-eighth Han.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dong&#8217;s ancestors came from Poyarkovo, a Russian border village near China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The October Revolution of 1917 was the fall of Imperial Russia. A civil war gripped the country up until the early 1920s. His great-grandparents crossed the frozen Heilongjiang River, also known as Amur River, by sleigh with their two children in 1926 to flee post-civil war conditions. They settled in Xunke county, Heilongjiang Province.</p>
<p>Xunke county is home to the first Russian ethnic village in China, which attracts many tourists for its distinctive ethnic characteristics, Dong said.</p>
<p>According to data from the 2010 national census, there are more than 15,000 ethnic Russians in China, and most of them live in villages along the Heilongjiang River. It is one of the least populous ethnic groups in China.</p>
<p>Dong was born and raised in China. Dong&#8217;s grandparents practiced Russian ethnic customs. Roasting Russian bread and making borsch soup are just some of the fond memories from his childhood. &#8220;However, I don&#8217;t cook Russian food now. I enjoy having maize gruel and eat green onions with soybean sauce directly, which is authentic northeastern Chinese cuisine,&#8221; Dong said.</p>
<p>Dong and his wife, Yang Yuemei, who is Han, have a 20-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>My children have never been laughed at for their mixed looks. They don&#8217;t find themselves special among people as I did during my youth, Dong said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years, China has made great efforts to protect and develop ethnic minorities. The 56 ethnic groups have become more and more united and prosperous together. We are the Russian ethnic group of China, and this look is our ethnic characteristics, so there&#8217;s nothing funny about it anymore in this age,&#8221; he explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the rapid development of mass media from TV to the internet, a wider range of people can easily attain information. Although the population of the Russian ethnic group is small and most of them live in the north, people have gotten to know their life more with online broadcasting and short videos.</p>
<p>More are familiar with the Russian ethnic group through the short videos of &#8220;Uncle Petrov&#8221; on Kuaishou.</p>
<p>Dong is proud of helping introduce his ethnic group to all of China.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Web celebrity</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, thanks to a reality show and his unique traits, Dong found unexpected fame. In January 2018, he went live online at the persuasion of his wife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He initially refused going live as the farmer strongly disliked the idea of people posting judgmental comments. However, it turned out that everyone liked &#8220;Uncle Petrov.&#8221; Whether it&#8217;s planting, harvesting crops, or family parties, Dong enjoys sharing his daily life in rural areas with audiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still Russian personality traits in my character, which is optimistic, unconstrained and fun-loving,&#8221; Dong said, adding that &#8220;I also love drinking alcohol so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dong&#8217;s short videos make his audience curious for his seemingly foreign face. &#8220;How could a Russian uncle speak northeastern dialect better than me? Is this a dub?&#8221; audiences asked.</p>
<p>People working in cities enjoy watching his live broadcasting as their occupation and lives are under heavy pressure, he said. Dong&#8217;s unrestrained rural life and his happiness toward farming work deliver positive energy to his fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoy being a farmer; no one can change my mind no matter how popular online I become. And I am a Chinese. I am proud to introduce Russian ethnic group of China to everyone,&#8221; Dong told the Global Times.<br />

<p>&#8220;Old and ugly, but never worried about finding a husband, Jungar No. 214 mare found herself a husband less than six month after being released to the wild,&#8221; Zhang Hefan wrote in her new book<br />
<em>Home of Wild Horse: Wild Horse Observation Diary</em>.</p>
<p>Zhang, 45, a senior engineer at the Przewalski&#8217;s horse breeding center in Northwest China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region, just published her fourth book in November.</p>
<p>The book records the real stories of the 15 Przewalski&#8217;s horses, the 16th batch that was released to the wild by the center back in 2018. The diary follows the horses and their journey of gradually adapting to their natural habitat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Przewalski&#8217;s horse, the only existing wild horse on the planet, is native to the Jungar Basin of Xinjiang and has an evolutionary history of more than 60 million years.</p>
<p>The horse is rarer than giant pandas with only approximately 2,000 surviving in the world.</p>
<p>Since 1985, China started reintroducing Przewalski&#8217;s horses from the UK, Germany and the US. In 2008, the first batch of the horses were returned to the wild, and in 2013, they started to reproduce and breed in the wild with a 100 percent reproductive survival rate for many consecutive years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Omnipotent writer</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;I have participated in every stage of Przewalski&#8217;s horses&#8217; breeding from reproduction, vaccination, archiving, and now publicizing,&#8221; Zhang said.</p>
<p>Majoring in veterinary medicine, Zhang was recruited to the breeding center in 1995.</p>
<p>Speaking of her career from a veterinarian to a writer and photographer, Zhang told the Global Times that she started keeping her diary from the first day she worked in the breeding center as life was boring in the wild. &#8220;So I checked on the Przewalski&#8217;s horses every day since there was nothing else to do, and kept the breeders&#8217; daily works in my diaries at night together with some of my thoughts,&#8221; said Zhang.</p>
<p>This is how Zhang accumulated large amounts of first-hand material on breeding Przewalski&#8217;s horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kept my diaries for eight years, and one day a chief editor of a magazine suggested that I compile my diaries into a book,&#8221; said Zhang. &#8220;Then my first book<br />
<em>Przewalski&#8217;s Horses Return Karamaili</em> was published in 2005,&#8221; Zhang added.</p>
<p>After the first book, she continued tracking, observing and recording stories of Przewalski&#8217;s horses and their protectors.&nbsp; After the horses are released to the wild the center still tracks, monitors and, at times, rescues these precious creatures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rushing out ranches and going to the wild are the highest aspirations of a wild horse, and galloping in the pasture is the real life for them, which attributes to their protectors, those who love wild horses like they love their own eyes,&#8221; said Zhang in the preface of her new book. &#8220;They brought the horses back home and stuck with them in the remote wilderness together with their own loneness and passing youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zhang said there is a popular saying among the men working in the breeding center that they enjoy the company of Przewalski&#8217;s horses more than that of their wife and children.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like sending their own children away after they grow up,&#8221; Zhang said, describing her feeling days before the release. &#8220;Along with excitement and happiness, there is more attachment deep in the heart of these protectors, especially to the old horses as they accompanied each other&#8217;s tender years,&#8221; Zhang added.</p>
<p>Different from other science writers who usually adopt an objective standpoint, Zhang tells the Przewalski&#8217;s horses&#8217; stories as if she was telling the story of a friend she connected with emotionally.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the releasing day is approaching, these wild horses look excited and anxious and they would stand by the gate and stare to the distance for a long time, and when the day is finally coming, there is fire brightly blazing in their eyes just like they are young again,&#8221; Zhang wrote in the book.</p>
<p>Zhang told the Global Times that the science of breeding Przewalski&#8217;s horses all lies in these stories telling their daily activities and behavior patterns. &#8220;Sometimes, it was not my intention to spread science, and it was there when I told their stories.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong></p>
<p>Speaking for wild horses</strong></span></p>
<p>Zhang told the Global Times that her favorite work in the breeding center is publicity, which allows more people to understand the lovely and rare species and boost efforts for their conservation. More importantly, it is necessary to record the efforts and sacrifice these protectors made in the past three decades since the reintroduction of Przewalski&#8217;s horse, said Zhang.</p>
<p>Zhang hopes more resources could be put toward publicizing the protection of wild animals, especially those facing extinction such as Przewalski&#8217;s horses. &#8220;The Przewalski&#8217;s horse is rarer than giant pandas, while having much less popularity than pandas, so I hope a synergy could be created to send more wild horses back to the wilderness.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Horses cannot speak, while I can speak out for them with my pen and lens about the humiliation and grief after a hundred years&#8217; exile, as well as the pride and joy of coming back to their homeland,&#8221; Zhang told the Global Times. &#8220;You can read their stead clops o hear the most triumphal whinny on their way back home,&#8221; Zhang added.</p>
<p>According to the latest data from the Przewalski&#8217;s horse breeding center in Xinjiang, there are a total of 593 Przewalski&#8217;s horses in Xinjiang and Northwest China&#8217;s Gansu Province, and some 60 Przewalski&#8217;s horse are kept in zoos of other provinces. China has more than 600 Przewalski&#8217;s horses, the most in the world.</p>
<p>On August 28, 2001, China successfully returned first group of Przewalski&#8217;s horses in Karamaili. After that, a total of 110 Przewalski&#8217;s horses have been reintroduced to the wild in the nature reserve.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Qimeiduoji in his mail truck Photo: China Post</p>
<p>Qimeiduoji is something of a legend along the Sichuan-Tibet Road on the plateau.</p>
<p>For three decades he has driven a mail truck to deliver mail between Garze and Dege, the Tibetan counties in Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>He drives on the snow line at an average altitude of 3,500 meters and has traveled 1.4 million kilometers in total.</p>
<p>He never had a traffic accident on the road, but he has experienced and survived several perils.</p>
<p>His story is gradually getting public recognition around the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>First mail truck</strong></span></p>
<p>On December 15, 1954, the Sichuan-Tibet Road was opened. Two green main trucks began delivering mail from throughout China, starting from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province to Lhasa. This was the beginning of the Sichuan-Tibet mail line.</p>
<p>The delivery trucks have been running strong for six decades, enduring the route no matter the risks.</p>
<p>Dege county is the last stop in Sichuan before entering Tibet Autonomous Region, Southwest China, on the Sichuan-Tibet Road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was a kid, there were a few vehicles on the high plateau. Besides those of the military, we could only see mail trucks,&#8221; Qumaduoji, who is 56 now, said. &#8220;In my hometown, the first newspaper and my letter of admission to technical school were both sent by postmen. Whenever seeing mail trucks, people waved their hands to greet them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1988, the post and telegram bureau of Dege built up its first comprehensive office building, and obtained its first and only mail truck.</p>
<p>The only mail truck called for a reliable driver. Qimeiduoji was recommended. He could not only drive, but also fix the vehicle. Perhaps most importantly, his good personality was famous among Dege residents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qimeiduoji, a truck driver, happily accepted the task.</p>
<p>Since 1988, the only mail truck in Dege always has Qimeiduoji behind the wheel. Through snow or ice, wherever the mail truck is, Qimeiduoji can be found in the driver&#8217;s seat.</p>
<p>In 1998, Qimeiduoji volunteered to move to Garze, about 500 kilometers from Dege, and take the task of the long-trip snow line route. &#8220;I would accept everything, as long as I could drive the mail truck,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Que&#8217;er Mountain in Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province Photo: VCG</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Dangerous journey</strong></span></p>
<p>The mail roads from Garze to other counties climb over mountains covered with snow all year-round. The most dangerous and highest is the Que&#8217;er Mountain, 6,168 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Qimeiduoji picked the route between Garze and Dege, which is the highest and most precipitous mail road in China. In winter, temperatures can reach -30 C, and Qimeiguoji had to set off at 6 am. Sometimes, the diesel would be frozen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look outside. There&#8217;s only the eagle in the sky and the mail truck on the ground,&#8221; Qimeiduoji said, while driving through an abyss of snow.</p>
<p>In the summer, dust and pebbles constantly roll from the cliffs. Many types of wreckage could be spotted at the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p>In 2000, Qimeiduoji and a colleague encountered an avalanche. To keep the mail truck in decent condition, they used barrels and shovels to clear the road. It took two days to move one single kilometer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mountains are not the only thing that poses danger.</p>
<p>Qimeiduoji&#8217;s two sons are both post employees. However, his elder son died suddenly before his wedding in 2011, devastating his fiancee.</p>
<p>A year later, Qimeiduoji was driving from Qingbaijiang to Garze, to deliver textbooks for primary and high schools in Garze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 10 robbers with knives and sticks stopped his truck. The assailants surrounded him.</p>
<p>Qimeiduoji was alone. His first priority was protecting the truck. So he jumped off the truck to confront the robbers. He was attacked immediately with 17 cuts. His four ribs were broken and skull was fractured. The vein of his left hand was cut.</p>
<p>He stayed in ICU for a week, but he survived.</p>
<p>While some were urging the resilient Qimeiduoji to take revenge, he simply said &#8220;We should believe in law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three months after surgery, Qimeiduoji&#8217;s left hand was still incapable of driving. He was forced to retire.</p>
<p>But he did not give up and tried out every tiny opportunity to get back on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An old doctor told Qimeiduoji to break the stiff muscles and let them grow again. He did, with great pain, but after two months, the miracle came &#8211; his left hand recovered its function.</p>
<p>Colleagues asked Qimeiduoji to rest from driving, but his wife Zeren Quxi supported him going back to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mail truck is my second lover. How could I give up?&#8221; Qimeiduoji said. When he started the ignition, he felt as if his deceased son and former self had returned.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>National role model</strong></span></p>
<p>With long hair and a tanned, angular figure, Qimeiduoji looks like a rock-and-roll star in photos. His name, Duoji, or Dorje, means Buddha&#8217;s warrior attendant in Tibetan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yadong, his friend of many years, became a famous singer. &#8220;Yadong asked me to sing and perform. But I prefer driving. I can also sing on the road,&#8221; Qimeiduoji said.</p>
<p>He has also been awarded with many national prizes and titles for being a role model.</p>
<p>On April 18, State Councilor Wang Yong addressed a seminar on Qimeiduoji&#8217;s meritorious deeds, according to the website of the State Council.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s development calls for role models, Wang said. As an outstanding representative of grassroots staff at State-owned enterprises, Qimeiduoji has made remarkable contributions in his position with his dedication to postal service in Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region over the past 30 years.</p>
<p>A book,<br />
<em>The height of Que&#8217;er Mountain</em> &#8211; the Story of Qimeiduoji, was published in 2018. &#8220;Qimeiduoji&#8217;s story shows ups and downs and is touching,&#8221; said Li Jingze, vice president of the Chinese Writers Association, adding that &#8220;the height of Que&#8217;er Mountain symbolizes the height of humanity and belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Qimeiduoji&#8217;s hometown Dege is the home to King Gesar, a hero-god in Tibetan culture. When people in Dege mention Qimeiduoji, they often say &#8220;He has the blood of King Gesar.&#8221;<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Award-winning work <em>The Moment</em> Photo: Courtesy of Bao Yongqing</p>
<p>For Bao Yongqing, a photographer from Northwest China&#8217;s Qinghai Province, it is &#8220;a surprise&#8221; to win the world&#8217;s most highly respected competition for wildlife photography, the first time a Chinese photographer has won the prize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bao&#8217;s work,<br />
<em>The Moment</em>, which beat out over 48,000 entries from 100 countries and regions to take the top prize of the Wildlife Photography of the Year, depicts two animals, a marmot and a Tibetan fox, coiled in a life and death moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given by the Natural History Museum, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year&nbsp;competition it is an annual international showcase of the best in nature&nbsp;photography.</p>
<p>The image vividly catches the Tibetan fox pounce into attack and the marmot&#8217;s startled expression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The expressive intensity of the postures holds you transfixed, and the thread of energy between the raised paws seems to hold the protagonists in perfect balance,&#8221; Roz Kidman Cox, chief judge of the prize, was cited by ABC News as saying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel honored to introduce these wild elves to the international community,&#8221; Bao told the Global Times. He noted that he wants to show more people the meaning of protecting the nature through his work.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Bao Yongqing during a shoot in the wild Photo: Courtesy of Bao Yongqing</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"></p>
<p>Making of a masterpiece</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bao said that<br />
<em>The Moment</em> was taken in early spring in Tianjun county in the Qilian Mountain national park after he tracked the animals for quite a long period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Qilian Mountain area is Bao&#8217;s hometown and also one of Northwest China&#8217;s important places for biodiversity protection work. It is also a haven for many wild animals, including the snow leopard, the Himalayan brown bear, the steppe wolf, the Tibetan fox, and the Thorold&#8217;s deer, also known as the white-lipped deer. The Tibetan fox and the marmot in Bao&#8217;s picture are species found only in China&#8217;s Tibetan Plateau. Bao has observed the Tibetan fox for a long time and knows their behavior very well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He noted that the breeding season of the Tibetan fox is from March to July. The Tibetan fox in Bao&#8217;s picture is a mother of three cubs and she needs to go hunting early in the morning every day. The mother fox needs to hunt even more because her cubs&#8217; appetites grow as they get older. There are fewer chances to successfully catch a pika, but a marmot could keep the cubs full for two days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bao said he once took a video of the Tibetan fox hunting the marmot. To capture the hunting moment, he followed the Tibetan fox for many days. &#8220;I knew she was trying to hunt a marmot. I waited and observed near her den,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, after seeing the Tibetan fox was about to ambush a den of marmots, Bao quickly and covertly placed the camera to get the shot he had been waiting for. &#8220;The marmot was very alert and kept sending warnings after finding the fox. But around an hour later, it began to leave the den to find food,&#8221; said Bao.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tibetan fox waited the opportunity &#8211; she jumped toward the marmot and bit it. The two coiled together as the marmot fiercely fought for its life,&#8221; Bao said, noting that deep in his heart, he hoped the fight ended with the two animals leaving with their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the law of nature is the survival of the fittest. The story behind<br />
<em>The Moment</em> is not as good as Bao imagined. Although the other two marmots joined the fight to drive away the fox, they failed as the fox kept attacking the one that had been injured. The injured marmot was knocked on the ground unconscious and taken away by the fox.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Revering nature</span></strong></p>
<p>Bao felt depressed when taking the picture especially when he saw the terrified face of the marmot. &#8220;But in our planet, every species has its own way of living. Interference from others may lead to an unexpected result,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not disturbing the animals&#8217; lives has become a strict rule for Bao and it also means he often works alone. But the difficulties of bearing loneliness and overcoming high altitude sickness &#8220;is nothing&#8221; compared with the excellent moment he captured of the animals. As the chief photographer for the Qilian Mountain national park, one of Bao&#8217;s daily works is to promote protecting the nature and its meaning by showing his photos to tourists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bao said &#8220;during years of photography, I have come to realize that there is a long way to go in terms of environmental conservation. And we have done a good job in the Qilian Mountain areas in recent years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government has made great efforts in protecting nature and residents&#8217; awareness has also been increased. &#8220;There are more wild animals living in the Qilian Mountain,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;People who are responsible for patrolling and daily protection work in the Qilian Mountain area, local herdsmen who live in the area and my counterparts who also pay attention to animal protection all contribute to my work. Without them, there will be no such a good ecological environment being captured in my images,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He hopes more people will understand the true life of wild animals, love them, preserve them, and protect them. If more people can become friendly to the nature and animals through his work, &#8220;that will be the greatest achievements for me in life as a photographer,&#8221; he said.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Li Yunhe stands in a cultural relic conservation laboratory in Guazhou county, Northwest China&#8217;s Gansu Province on October 25, 2017. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Li Yunhe places brown framed glasses snuggly upon his eyes. A white lens splits the lenses into two with one for recreational use and the other set for his profession, restoring murals in the Mogao Grottoes in Northwest China&#8217;s Gansu Province. Li has been at it for 63 years, helping restore more than 4,000 square meters of murals.</p>
<p>The more than 1,000-year-old Mogao Grottoes of 735 caves is a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. Each cave has Buddha statues and wall paintings illustrating the lives and religions of people from different dynasties, carrying historical and cultural value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1956, Li came to the Mogao Grottoes to become its first mural restorer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 86-year-old man is as healthy and diligent as ever, often showing up to work dressed in denim uniform and donning a hat covering his gray hair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His tool kit is always equipped with what he needs, including his decades of experience acquiring techniques to restore murals. Li and his apprentices are invited to help restore murals in other regions in China every year.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>First love</strong></span></p>
<p>When Li first came to Dunhuang, where the Mogao Grottoes located, he saw the No. 161 Mogao grotto dug in late Tang Dynasty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mural was fast deteriorating. When the door opened and the wind blew, pieces of the mural fluttered down like snowflakes. Li has recalled this memory on different occasions throughout the years. &#8220;I felt heartbroken,&#8221; Li told the Beijing News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Li had to collect every falling piece and passed them back to the wall. There was no other method he can use at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took Li and his co-workers more than 700 days to restore the 60-square-meter mural. Whenever people mention the No. 161 grotto, it is through the acknowledgement of the relic being a starting point of domestic mural restoration work. The mural was the first grotto to be independently restored by Chinese people in the history of Dunhuang Academy China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mural is susceptible to erosion, a process which can cause mildew and obscure of the pattern.. Some murals will unwrap like scales or experience a buildup of hoar-frost. Murals can also detach or fall off completely from the walls. The responsibility of mural restorers are to dedust, pad, bond and do anything it takes to ensure the survival of murals for as long as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Find own way</strong></span></p>
<p>The Mogao Grottoes have experienced various natural and man-made disasters over the past centuries, including sand erosion, war and plunder by Western colonialism. Li hardly had any sufficient equipment to preserve the cultural relics in the Mogao Grottoes when he began to work. Faced with a large area of broken murals, Li started to innovate his own way of restoration.</p>
<p>What Li lacked in tools, he made up for in a kitchen. He baked the material on the stove to observe the properties of the material through temperature changes, and then study corresponding repair methods.</p>
<p>The Dunhuang Academy China invited Czech experts to help restore the mural, but the Czech experts kept the details of the restoration materials and techniques secret.</p>
<p>Li secretly observed the repair process on the side. After the experts left, Li gathered a brush, dropper, syringe and other tools to imitate the repair, and finally devised a process for repairing murals.</p>
<p>Li regards mural protection as an endless science. The 86-year-old elderly is still learning the use of new polymer repair materials on his own.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Tough environment</strong></span></p>
<p>Li has lived in the staff dormitory, formally a horse stable in the grotto, for about 30 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the mud houses he and his colleagues live in, there were only beds, chairs, and some desks. When he woke up in the morning, Li felt dust piled on his face and dirt in his nose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The summer sun in the region can burn human skin. In the winter, people usually wear sheepskin coats to brave the bitter cold.</p>
<p>Noodles boiled in hot water are a regional delicacy. It is served with an added pinch of salt and vinegar, and eaten with chopsticks made from willow branches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the arrival of tap water to the region in the 1980s, Li drank water from a spring called Kukouquan, which has a high level of salt and bitter taste.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came here at first, I suffered from diarrhea for about a month,&#8221; Li told the Beijing News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1985, Li moved to an apartment, which is two kilometers away from where he had lived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1990s, his institute arranged for him to live a house in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu, and offered Li to leave frontlines for more comfortable work. Li promptly declined.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have restored murals for my whole life. What should I do in Lanzhou? I would rather guard these staff at Dunhuang,&#8221; Li noted to the Beijing News.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Inheritance</strong></span></p>
<p>Repairing ancient relics is a tedious job, but Li still encourages his grandson Li Xiaoyang to inherit the craft.</p>
<p>Their fates with the Mogao grottoes have a similar trajectory.</p>
<p>In 1956, Li, as a 24-year-old graduate, stopped by to visit his uncle, who was working at Dunhuang Academy China, on his way to<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> in response to the national call for supporting the construction of border area. He never thought his &#8220;stopover&#8221; would last for 60 years.</p>
<p>His grandson, Li Xiaoyang, who was 22 in 2011 when graduated in interior design from a university in Melbourne, Australia, meant to stay abroad for another two years. He never anticipated he would stay home to follow his grandfather&#8217;s footsteps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had planned to stay abroad, but my grandfather had a deep inspiration on me and he encouraged me to make mural restoration an enduring career in China,&#8221; the grandson said to Southern People Weekly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandpa always stressed that we should be in awe of cultural relics, because we are here to treat them, like a doctor with a patient,&#8221; Li Xiaoyang told the Southern People Weekly. &#8220;Exactly because cultural relics are like patients who cannot speak, we should be more responsible and careful. If you can&#8217;t save it, at least don&#8217;t destroy it. Our value is to keep it alive.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Bhutanese photographer Pawo Choyning Dorji Photo: Li Hao/GT</p>
<p>When Bhutanese photographer Pawo Choyning Dorji went into a bookstore in Beijing&#8217;s bustling Sanlitun area in 2012 and asked for a book about Xuanzang, a legendary Chinese Buddhist monk, he was offered the mythology book<br />
<em>Journey to the West</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was then surprised to find out that people only associate Xuanzang with the book and the Monkey King, a fictional character in the novel. Xuanzang&#8217;s real achievements and good qualities seemed to be forgotten by the general public in China. At that moment, Dorji, a pious Buddhist, came up with the idea of retracing Xuanzang&#8217;s journey from China to India to show a visual story.</p>
<p>In September, he launched a photo exhibition about his journey from Beijing and released the book<br />
<em>Light of the Moon: The Life &amp; Legacy of Xuanzang of Tang</em> in Chinese. It took Dorji almost five years to finish the project. He trekked through Northwest China&#8217;s Shaanxi and Gansu provinces,<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uyghur Autonomous Region and then toward the south to countries including Nepal, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, a journey Xuanzang embarked on more than 1,300 years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;In countries like Nepal and India, Buddhism is the foundation of the history, and Xuanzang played such an important role in setting the foundations for this history,&#8221; Dorji told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I find it interesting that this man whose life was about this journey to India walked by himself across the harshest deserts, highest mountain,&#8221; he said. Dorji found it strange that in his country, Xuanzang is more remembered in regards to the Monkey King than for his own legacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After his photo exhibition in China, Dorji plans to take it to India.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Shadow and light</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Born into an aristocratic family in Bhutan, Dorji spent many years in India where he got to know stories about Xuanzang.</p>
<p>While there are some scholarly books written about Xuanzang, Dorji&nbsp; believes these accounts don&#8217;t connect with most people. He hopes his visual stories can better reach the public. However, his initial idea was met with opposition and many people told him that his vision was impossible to realize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;[For me] It&#8217;s not a question of being able to do it or not. It&#8217;s about doing it or not,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Xuanzang was more difficult than me because he had to walk. I have it easy because I have cars and planes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newer problems were in place for Dorji which Xuanzang did not need to bother with, such as getting visas.</p>
<p>Dorji applied for an Afghan visa three times. The first time, his visa request was declined. The second time, he found a German NGO which operates in Afghanistan. He intended to apply for the visa with the NGO as a photographer for the organization&#8217;s project in Afghanistan. Unexpectedly, a German aid worker was then kidnapped by Taliban and the German government ordered the German NGOs not to take people to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;On the third attempt, Dorji applied for a tourist visa. While the embassy staff was&nbsp; surprised that a tourist would come to their country, they granted him the visa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes time. But giving up was never an option for me,&#8221; he said, adding that he is lucky to have the support from his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the journey, Dorji said he learned more about the world we live in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you really want to appreciate the light, you must understand the shadow. And that is what this journey has brought. Because I went to many places that are regarded by the rest of the world as shadows, dark places,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you are there, you realized that [the people there] are just like you. We are culturally different but inside, we are capable of the same love.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, Dorji rented a bulletproof car for safety concerns. The car had a daily cost of $700. After about two weeks in Afghanistan, he prepared to leave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On his last day, he rode in his bulletproof car to the airport. While en route, a bomb exploded&nbsp; on the road. It then took three hours for him to finish the 15 minute path to the airport. Despite rushing to the terminal, he was told he missed his flight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then had to fly out another day, but had run out of money to reserve the bulletproof car, so he called for a regular car.</p>
<p>Worrying about Dorji&#8217;s safety, the car agency still sent him the bulletproof car for the price of the regular car.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dorji said this is one of the many acts of kindness he experienced during the trip. &#8220;The journey made me realize that the world we live in is very beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Reminder for the youth</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is really important about Xuanzang and the journey is the human qualities that it represents: to be courageous and fearless, believe in something so much that that is your ultimate goal and the determination of never giving up during this process,&#8221; Dorji said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added that he hoped his work could become a reminder for people about these qualities. &#8220;Living in a time where everything is faster, everything is digital, everything is modern, we are lacking these qualities,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially I think China needs to be reminded. If I was Chinese and someone asked me, what represents Chinese culture most? I would say Xuanzang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;China should never forget you have such a great history, amazing history. We must always look in the past to make our way for the future,&#8221; he stressed. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s very important, especially for the Chinese youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorji has a daughter and son, whom his journey away from brought him closer too. Dorji&#8217;s driver in Afghanistan said that in a country devastated by two decades of conflict, the safety of his family is a daily concern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The driver cannot guarantee safety and security for his own family, but said that until he can, he will try his best to be a good father and husband.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;After I had conversation with him, I feel like maybe I became a better father. I appreciate my time with my children more now,&#8221; he said.<br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Wang Longde, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering Photo: IC</p>
<p>Wang Longde, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, served as vice minister of the National Health Commission of China for more than 10 years, playing a significant leadership role in the country&#8217;s public health field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As president of the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association, he has been engaged in professional research on epidemiology and public health promotion in China for more than a decade. He put forward and led the establishment of China&#8217;s network-based infectious and emergent disease reporting system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personal growth is closely related to the whole country,&#8221; Wang told the Global Times. He believes that only by paying attention to the most important needs of the country and the people can a person make real achievements in his or her career development. This belief is reflected in his decades of efforts in China&#8217;s AIDS prevention work.</p>
<p>The end of the 20th century saw&nbsp; AIDS spreading fast in China, especially in the country&#8217;s central region. Due to the large number of paid blood donors, many people became infected in the 1990s, and developed full-blown AIDS after eight to 10 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Wang took charge of disease control in early 2004, he made several trips to Central China&#8217;s Henan Province and found that the biggest problem was the inability to determine who had been infected.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, China began implementing the &#8216;Four Free and One Care&#8217; policy to help all Chinese HIV/AIDS sufferers. The program provided free ARV drugs, free prevention of mother-to-child transmission, free voluntary counseling and testing, free education for children orphaned by AIDS and care to people living with HIV. But who should be our target? That was a major problem,&#8221; Wang told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt the most urgent task was to find out the source of the outbreak. In June and July of 2004, there were 280,000 paid blood donors registered, and we found more than 23,000 HIV patients out of 250,000 donors. If we could track them, it would enable us to offer treatment, and tighten control in our prevention work,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This approach drew condemnation from some other countries due to concerns over human rights violations, as AIDS testing was conducted on a voluntary basis in many other countries, Wang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, soon after, some global institutions realized that our testing scheme had dramatically improved the effectiveness of HIV prevention work. Since then, they have gradually changed their views,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under the Department of Health and Human Services in the US, for example, changed its AIDS testing guidelines in 2006 to encourage healthcare providers to make testing a routine program.</p>
<p>At the 16th International Conference on AIDS, held in Toronto in 2006, former US president Bill Clinton said in his speech that China recognized the seriousness of the AIDS epidemic and began to take comprehensive measures to address the problem. Clinton suggested that China&#8217;s actions deserve the respect of the US, according to Wang.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows that we have grasped the key problem, adopted some innovative models instead of following the outdated views of the international community to deal with the epidemic and achieved good results,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;This is the contribution China has made to the international community.</p>
<p>A similarly grim challenge emerged in the effort to detect those infected during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral respiratory disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In March 2003, an investigation revealed that there had been 320 infected cases, but we only received just over 20 cases. That was largely because of our outdated information reporting system,&#8221; said him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way traditional reporting systems work is that when doctors find infected patients, they fill out a paper report card and report it to state authorities step by step, which takes a long time. How can patients with serious infectious diseases like SARS survive this lagging and inefficient reporting system?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought about how we could construct an efficient information reporting highway by taking advantage of network resources. We immediately developed our network-based reporting system, and quickly put it into operation one month later. The digital system took only six hours from diagnosis to hearing of the cases at the CDC,&#8221; Wang recalled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, Wang could keep up to date on local conditions, the number of patients and the progress of the control measures at his office. By late May of 2003, the epidemic had been effectively controlled, and the transmission route largely cut thanks to the efficiency of the electronic network. By mid-June, there were almost no new cases.</p>
<p>In the past 70 years, it is fair to say that the biggest change in Chinese people&#8217;s health has been the increase in average life expectancy, from 35 years in the early days of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China to 77 years today. This is thanks to infectious disease control, especially vaccinating children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, the incidence of diseases such as measles and DTP (Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis) in China has been greatly reduced, which reflects the remarkable achievements we have made in this respect, Wang said.</p>
<p>In May of 2018, a report from Lancet, a world-leading medical journal, revealed that the score for China&#8217;s healthcare access and quality was 77.9 in 2016, placing it 48th out of 195 countries and regions. Between 1990 and 2016, China significantly increased its score for healthcare access and quality (an increase of 35.5 points), achieving some of the most pronounced gains worldwide. China has also seen one of the biggest improvements in medical quality.</p>
<p>The State Council, China&#8217;s cabinet, has issued new guidelines to implement the country&#8217;s Healthy China initiative and promote people&#8217;s health. &#8220;A healthy China is fundamental to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Without effective control of chronic diseases, we cannot achieve a &#8216;Healthy China,'&#8221; said Wang. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we are making health a national strategic priority.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Qu Geping (right) Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Qu Geping, 89, became China&#8217;s first environmental protection chief in 1987, when the bureau of environment protection was founded. The bureau has become the current Ministry of Environment and Ecology (MEE).</p>
<p>Qu began his environmental protection career in the 1970s, when there was not much awareness in China of this concept.</p>
<p>Over the past decades, Qu has witnessed the difficulties faced by China in this area. He likens the struggle to the legend of Sisyphus pushing the giant stone to the peak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, China&#8217;s environmental protection efforts are on the right track.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been working in the environment sector for almost 50 years, and had never seen such a good situation as there is now,&#8221; Qu said in an interview with the Southern Weekly. The report was posted on the official website of the MEE.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Revealing pollution</strong></span></p>
<p>Qu was a member of the first Chinese government delegation to the first United Nations Environment Program, the first director of the Chinese environmental protection bureau.</p>
<p>However, he does not like people calling him &#8220;the father of Chinese environmental protection,&#8221; as he believes that title should be given to former Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, who set China on the road to environmental protection.</p>
<p>Looking back, Qu said that environmental protection work in China has been &#8220;extremely difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he has spent his entire career in the field, he believes he entered the sector by accident.</p>
<p>Qu first learned about environmental issues and its effects on social and economic development in 1972 in Stockholm, Sweden, during the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. That was when Qu realized the potential threat that environmental problems posed to China.</p>
<p>The first national environmental protection conference was held in 1973. Even back then, the situation in China was severe. &#8220;Air pollution, water pollution, garbage, chemical pollutionâ€¦ it was already very serious,&#8221; Qu said.</p>
<p>However, Chinese people at that time did not have a clue about the concept of &#8220;environmental protection.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in the 1960s and 1970s, Chinese people believed there was no pollution in China. But in reality, Guanting Reservoir and Baiyangdian Lake near Beijing, as well as the famous Lijiang River in Guilin, South China&#8217;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, were all severely polluted, Qu said, the China Youth Daily reported.</p>
<p>Qu and the organizers of the conference distributed a document revealing the environmental problems in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The facts shocked the attendants, and that was the beginning of China&#8217;s pollution management drive.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Facing the truth</strong></span></p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Qu decided to report the truth of the environmental situation to the central government, the China Youth Daily reported.</p>
<p>After a bold investigation, he handed in some &#8220;terrifying&#8221; data, indicating that environmental pollution and ecological damage were resulting in annual economic losses of 95 billion yuan at that time in China, accounting for 14 percent of output value. &#8220;Environmental problems had become a great barrier and threat to domestic economic development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of the report, former vice premier Wan Li decided to hold another national environmental protection conference in 1983, calling for the whole of society to pay attention to environmental issues.</p>
<p>In January 1984, environmental protection became a strategic task for China&#8217;s modernization construction, as well as an important national policy.</p>
<p>In 1987, Qu became the first chief of the national environmental protection bureau.</p>
<p>During Qu&#8217;s career at the front line of battling pollution and protecting the environment, he put forward the idea that economic, urban-rural and environment construction should be developed at the same pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also initiated the environmental system of &#8220;those who pollute must resolve,&#8221; which became the foundation of environmental management in China. At the same time, he made great efforts in promoting legislation for environmental and resource protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;The environment is different from other departments. It&#8217;s very broad,&#8221; Qu said, &#8220;It involves every industry in the economy. It was impossible to imagine that [to protect the environment], key companies, governmental departments and regions all had to take action.&#8221;</p>

<p>A better time</strong></span></p>
<p>Qu remembered that during a national air pollution resolution conference in Taiyuan, North China&#8217;s Shanxi Province in 1987, pollution was severe in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;An attendant told me that he rode a bicycle to his workplace, which took 30 minutes. Without glasses, dust would often enter his eyes after the ride. With glasses, his face would become like a &#8216;panda.&#8217; His trousers were also covered with dust.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the interview with the Southern Weekly earlier this year, Qu admitted that there are still many places where China falls short on the environment, but protection quality has improved a great deal around the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today in Taiyuan, even if a shirt is left outside for three to five days, it would not be dirtier than a shirt left outside for one hour in 1980s. This is an achievement that makes environment protectors like me relieved,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Since the 18th Communist Party of China National Congress in 2012, environmental protection work has been placed in a central position in the government&#8217;s key strategies, Qu said. &#8220;The change is massive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his opinion, only with national-level attention and investment can environment and ecology work be guaranteed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Comparing the past and now, we can all see the change. I am optimistic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Qu is also one of the pioneers of environmental protection education, making great contribution to developing higher education, professional education and public education on the environment.</p>
<p>On June 15, a symposium themed &#8220;Qu Geping devoted to environmental protection for 50 years&#8221; was held at Beijing&#8217;s Tsinghua University, according to the website of the university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The generation of environmental protectors like me has no regrets about what we have done, and we are confident about the future,&#8221; Qu said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Zhang Fuqing gives a solemn military salute. Photo: Courtesy of Tang Jun</p>
<p>Zhang Fuqing&#8217;s many certificates and medals of honor had never been unveiled until 62 years later.&nbsp; A yellowing meritorious service certificate shows that he destroyed four enemy pillboxes and served as a commando many times during the War of Liberation (1946-49).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This 95-year-old war veteran sealed up years of memories and did not mention any of the details to his offspring until the local veterans&#8217; affairs bureau began collecting ex-servicemen&#8217;s information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He enlisted in the People&#8217;s Liberation Army in March 1948. More than 70 years later, he was honored as a national role model by the Central Spiritual Civilization Development Steering Commission on September 5.</p>
<p><strong>Recognizing a hero</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On December 3, 2018, Zhang Jianquan, Zhang Fuqing&#8217;s younger son, carefully carried a parcel to the Public Security Bureau in Laifeng county, Central China&#8217;s Hubei Province. It was a parcel he considered a treasure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that time, the county level bureau was collecting information on all its veterans, as required by a directive from the Ministry of Veterans Affairs in August 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was 5:20 pm and I was wrapping up my day. When the shining medals were taken out, I was drawn to them,&#8221; Nie Haibo, a staff member working on information collection for retired military personnel in the county, was quoted as saying by Xinhua News Agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhang turned out to be a soldier in the Northwest Field Army during the War of Liberation, and had been honored as a &#8220;combat hero&#8221; twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the medals had been kept in an envelope. I figured that as it had not been taken out, my generation has not seen these items before. I was seeing it all for the first time,&#8221; Zhang Jianquan told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nie was so excited to see the documents and medals and said, &#8220;It didn&#8217;t occur to me that there could be such a hero in our county,&#8221; according to the Xinhua report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;War is cruel and it&#8217;s difficult for my father to relive the battles he has fought in. Once he thinks of others&#8217; sacrifice, his eyes well up with tears,&#8221; Zhang Jianquan said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ready to sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>Zhang has fought in many battles as a commando and a company leader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the eighth company commander in the squad one night when three battalion commanders were killed,&#8221; his son said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Yongfeng battle, Zhang led an assault group and took over the town overnight, taking over two enemy blockhouses, disarming two machine guns, and beating back several rounds of enemy attacks until dawn. Our army entered the township and eliminated the enemy,&#8221; said the service certificate for Zhang in November 1948.</p>
<p>He kept the documents to himself, &#8220;as I don&#8217;t want to let my children know and show off about it,&#8221; Zhang told CCTV in May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who fought side by side with me have all sacrificed their lives for our country and people, they should have much more honor than me. How can I call myself a hero?&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhang hesitated when the information collection work began across the country. &#8220;But if I don&#8217;t submit my veteran information, that would be disloyal,&#8221; he recalled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retirement from army</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of 1955, Zhang, then a company officer, was facing a turning point in his career. When he learned that conditions at Enshi, Hubei were hard and it was in urgent need of leadership, he chose to take up a position there.</p>
<p>Laifeng county, a small town in a mountainous area, is located at the junction of Hubei and Hunan provinces and Chongqing Municipality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Zhang settled here, he put away all those honors he gained for more than 60 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1981, Zhang was transferred to the China Construction Bank&#8217;s branch in Laifeng as vice president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;To make sure the loans could be repaid, Zhang lived in one of the factories to offer his help with production and sales. Those loans under his supervision have all been repaid,&#8221; Li said.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">The military medals awarded to Zhang Fuqing Photo: Courtesy of Tang Jun</p>
<p>By the time Zhang retired from the bank in 1984, the branch had built its own office and dormitory for staff. The bank staff increased to 10 people. All of Zhang&#8217;s colleagues were impressed with his leadership, Li said.</p>
<p>After retiring from his position at the bank, Zhang underwent eye surgery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the operation, Li Ganlin, the president of Laifeng branch of the China Construction Bank, specifically told Zhang to get his medical expenses reimbursed in full, adding that he was entitled to select the best artificial lens for his surgery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, Zhang chose the cheapest, Zhang Jianquan told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;He just refuses to put on those new clothes we bought for him, all of them are folded away and stored in a closet,&#8221; Zhang Jianquan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2012, Zhang was advised to have his left leg amputated due to a fever he had for days. He was then 88 years old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We all thought that grandpa would sit in a wheelchair all the time, but he insisted on trying a prosthetic limb and wanted to stand up on his own,&#8221; Zhang Ran, Zhang Fuqing&#8217;s granddaughter, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad was trying to stand up again so that he would not be a burden to us, so that we could contribute more without worrying about him or spending time taking care of him,&#8221; Zhang Jianquan said.<br />

<p>At 88 years of age, Zhou Yongmao remains as enthusiastic about his job as any young person, and arrives at his office for work promptly every day. As one of China&#8217;s earliest nuclear submarine and nuclear reactor experts, Zhou was appointed as an academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1995. He now works as a senior engineer at the China National Nuclear Corporation.</p>
<p>&#8220;China&#8217;s nuclear power development was first driven by the need to develop its own nuclear submarines. Now China&#8217;s overall nuclear power level is leading the world, both in terms of hardware and software facilities,&#8221; Zhou told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhou has made great contributions to China obtaining its own nuclear power technology intellectual property rights. &#8220;We must continue to develop our own nuclear energy technology at all costs without hesitation. We cannot play into Donald Trump&#8217;s hands. The level of nuclear weapons in our country is not far behind that of the most advanced nuclear weapons in the US,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Early devotion</strong></span></p>
<p>Zhou has been engaged in the design, research and construction of China&#8217;s critical reactor engineering and technology for decades. He has completed many major scientific research tasks in China, including early submarine nuclear power reactor design schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also participated in the successful design and construction of the high flux neutron beam reactor.</p>
<p>Zhou graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1955. Upon graduation, he was assigned to the Third Ministry of Machine Building, the predecessor of the Ministry of Nuclear Industry, due to his outstanding performance. He was then sent to the former Soviet Union for another three years to further explore nuclear power technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;I learnt that the former Soviet Union developed the first nuclear power plant in the world from a news report in 1954,&#8221; Zhou told the Global Times. &#8220;That surprised me a lot. At that time, coal was the main source of electricity in China, but transporting it took up a lot of resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But one kilogram of uranium can produce the same energy as 2,500 tons of high-quality coal, largely reducing the pressure on transport. From then, I became very interested in nuclear energy,&#8221; said Zhou.</p>
<p>During his study in the former Soviet Union, Zhou was given an opportunity to go to the world&#8217;s first nuclear power station to conduct research, which gave him a lot of experience for his future work with nuclear submarines.</p>
<p>Shortly after Zhou returned from studying in the former Soviet Union, China decided to develop its own nuclear submarines, said Zhou.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never seen a conventional submarine, let alone a nuclear one, so I was overwhelmed by the task. The schedule was quite tight. There were no computers, so complex operations were all done by hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zhou and two colleagues spent the night searching for information that was already public in other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technologies that were mature and no longer secrets for some developed countries were very valuable references for us,&#8221; Zhou recalled.</p>
<p>Zhou is proud to have witnessed the beginning of China&#8217;s atomic age. He was determined to pursue this industry, not just out of enthusiasm, but to better understand the great cause that Marie Curie initiated, said Zhou.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that time, nuclear energy was also an important front in China&#8217;s economic and national defense construction efforts. Zhou was inspired by legendary figures such as Qian Sanqiang, a Chinese physicist who is often called the father of the Chinese nuclear program, who gave them a great deal of advice in their work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Exposure risks</strong></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Scientists need to be willing to make sacrifices,&#8221; said Zhou, whose faith in scientific development has never been shaken in decades of research.</p>
<p>Zhou has experienced two cases of excessive nuclear radiation in his career.</p>
<p>One case involved a &#8220;fuel burnout&#8221; at a test rig in a research reactor in 1969. The situation was urgent and required people to clean up fissile debris, which gives off extremely damaging radioactive fission gases that can seep into the body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhou, as the director of the research office at that time, was the first to volunteer for the job. &#8220;I already have a son and a daughter. Young people should not be exposed to this risk,&#8221; he thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After working for 20 minutes, they came out and were found to have tiny bits of debris stuck onto the skin of their feet.</p>
<p>Their wounds were treated with petroleum sulfur acid until the blood spots were scraped from the surface, but the radioactive contamination was not completely removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years after the accident, Zhou was found to have problems such as lumbar spinal canal thinning, excessive blood glucose and lipid levels and gallstone enlargement, which led him to suspect that the injury could be accelerating his aging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Zhou&#8217;s eyes, with the improvements in China&#8217;s nuclear industry, more attention should be paid to the application of nuclear technology in people&#8217;s lives. One case in point is Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), led by Zhou, which uses nuclear technology to target cancer cells with precision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BNCT therapy is the result of joint research and achievements by nuclear reactor engineering experts, neurosurgery experts and radiation protection experts in China. It&#8217;s a project that Zhou has been working on and promoting recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almost 90 years old, and many of the scientists I worked with have passed away,&#8221; said Zhou.</p>
<p>&#8220;I probably won&#8217;t be able to keep a clear mind to talk to you if you come to interview me next year,&#8221; Zhou told the Global Times. &#8220;As long as I have a clear mind for one more day, I will never give up my nuclear energy career.&#8221; </p>
