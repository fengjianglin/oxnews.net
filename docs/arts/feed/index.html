<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Jackie Chan Photo: Li Hao/GT</p>
<p>Ten films from the Chinese mainland were randomly selected from a pool of 62 to be released in the island of Taiwan in 2020, while there are no restrictions on films from Taiwan when they are released in the mainland.</p>
<p>The 10 chosen movies include<br />
<em>Vanguard</em>, starring Jackie Chan,<br />
<em>Li Na</em>, directed by Peter Chan, and<br />
<em>Ash is Purest White</em>, which was nominated for the main competition of the 71st Cannes International Film Festival in April 2018, according to a report from the Beijing Evening News.</p>
<p>An additional 52 movies also applied for a Taiwan release, including<br />
<em>Last Later</em>, jointly made by Chinese and Japanese artists, and 27 have been placed on a waiting list. If any of the initially chosen 10 films encounter problems and cannot be broadcast, these 27 movies will have the opportunity to replace them.</p>
<p>A quota system in Taiwan for films from the Chinese mainland means that only 10 movies can be released in Taiwan each year. This quota was initially filled according to a first-come-first-served basis, but as the number of applications increased, the process was changed to a lottery system.</p>
<p>Analysts say the rule leads to the delayed release of popular movies from the Chinese mainland in Taiwan. For example,<br />
<em>Ash is Purest White</em>, which was popular in 2018, will be broadcast in Taiwan after two years when it is already available online.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council published 31 measures to benefit the island of Taiwan in February 2018, which placing no limits on the number of films and TV series produced in Taiwan that can be introduced in the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Xin Zhiyu, a producer of TV dramas from Taiwan, said that the beneficial policy can promote cultural exchanges in film and TV between the island and the mainland, and can offer more relevant work opportunities in Taiwan.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Fijian people perform a local dance to welcome tourists. Photo: Courtesy of Tourism Fiji </p>
<p>Tourism Fiji formalized its partnership with China&#8217;s Twitter-like social media platform Sina Weibo in Chengdu, Southwest China&#8217;s Sichuan Province on November 21, aiming to attract more consumers from the Chinese market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji is one of the first Pacific countries to sign a<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Memorandum of Understanding with China. The country sent a delegation to Beijing to attend the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;China is a very strategic market for us because it&#8217;s a market in which we see huge potential,&#8221; said Matthew Stoeckel, CEO of Tourism Fiji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China is Fiji&#8217;s fourth largest source market. More than 50,000 Chinese visited the country in 2018, hitting a record high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Couples and families are now the top two target consumers of Fiji&#8217;s tourism campaign in China. Chartered flights from cities like Tianjin and Hangzhou are available to visitors during the Chinese New Year, which is a time of reunion for millions of Chinese families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji is now finding opportunities in second-tier cities like Chengdu. Chengdu ranked at the top as the best performing economy of any Chinese city, overtaking Shenzhen, according to an annual report recently released by the US-based think tank the Milken Institute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have noticed the economic growth in Southwest China,&#8221; said Vincent Zheng, regional manager of Greater China for Tourism Fiji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope cities like Chengdu can become engines for our future growth.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tell Fiji through stories</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese tourists account for 5.5 percent of Fiji&#8217;s tourism market share, following Australia, New Zealand and North American countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji now invests in China for the long-term, hoping for the market&#8217;s future growth, and is now building a brand profile in the market to help build awareness among Chinese customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tourism Fiji has worked with Chinese travel agencies, set up a development board in Shanghai and leveraged the power of social media to create more influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tourism Fiji&#8217;s Sina Weibo account has more than 80,000 followers. Around 70 percent of these followers are in their 20s and 30s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Visitors aged between 25-35 are the major demographic for Chinese tourists in Fiji, &#8221; said Zheng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young tourists demand more personalized and diversified experiences. To cater to this group&#8217;s needs, Tourism Fiji has launched a project with Sina Weibo to have young idol Luo Yunxi share his travel experiences in a video which has earned nearly 200 million views on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to vocalize our unique selling proposition and taglines about Fiji. It&#8217;s really not something tangible. It&#8217;s emotional and experiences you have,&#8221; said Stoeckel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think social media is a really great channel to introduce Fiji through stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of Sina Weibo users interested in traveling has reached almost 200 million, making them one of the biggest interest groups on the social media platform. The content shared on the platform has also changed from standardized travel guides to niche and in-depth articles on lesser-known destinations such as Fiji.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approximately 127 million users published 4.9 billion posts related to travel in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Bula spirit&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Skydiving and snorkeling are the most popular activities among Chinese travelers. However, it&#8217;s the &#8221;<br />
<em>Bula</em> spirit&#8221; that distinguishes Fiji from other island countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Bula</em> is the word Fijians use when saying hello but it also means to wish others to have the energy of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You find the &#8216;<br />
<em>Bula</em> spirit&#8217; ubiquitously across Fiji,&#8221; said Stoeckel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everywhere you go, everyone will greet you with a heartfelt &#8216;<br />
<em>Bula</em>&#8216; and look you in the eyes. Trust me, you believe that is from the heart because it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fiji is now preparing for the second phase of its &#8220;Bulanaire&#8221; campaign next year, a word combining<br />
<em>Bula </em>with billionaire, which aims to celebrate those who are rich in happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Finding a balance</strong></p>
<p>Tourism is the pillar industry in Fiji, as it accounts for more than one-third of the country&#8217;s GDP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji seeks to maintain the sustainability of the tourism industry by combining business with charity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiji now invites visitors to participate in protecting the environment such as restoring coral reefs and working on the rehabilitation of turtles and other animals to make tourism &#8220;a very positive force.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By combining environmental-friendly experiences with tourism, Fiji&#8217;s model could possibly attract more tourists, including Chinese tourists as it makes traveling more than a leisure time activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where Fiji stands alone is the experiences you have there. You arrive as a guest but many will see you as a family,&#8221; said Stoeckel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since its opening in 2009, the High Line in New York has become an iconic contemporary landmark. The elevated park on an abandoned railway track is decorated with flowers, plants, outdoor art installations and gives visitors a look at the city&#8217;s sublime skyline. Meanwhile, half a world away in the South Korean capital of Seoul, a similar elevated park opened in 2017. Unlike the High Line, it hasn&#8217;t been overcrowded by tourists yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Partially inspired by the High Line, Seoullo 7017, also known as the Seoul Skygarden, was constructed on a disused overpass that closed in 2015. According to an introduction from the city government, the word Seoullo means &#8220;a path towards Seoul.&#8221; The number 7017 combines the year 1970, when the overpass was built, and 2017, when the area was reborn. Stretching from Seoul Station Plaza to the north of Seoul Station, the park connects popular tourist sites across the city such as Myeongdong, Namdaemun Market and Namsan.</p>
<p>The part got its start from an international design competition to renew the overpass held from January to April in 2015. Dutch architect and landscaper Winy Maas came out on top with his design to make the park a place where &#8220;nature and humans can live side by side,&#8221; as described by Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon after its opening in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skygarden offers a living dictionary of plants which are part of the natural heritage of South Korea… They are planted in containers of different sizes and height and organized in groups of families. The families are ordered according to the Korean alphabet,&#8221; the designer told media.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides immersing oneself in the local flora, everyone is invited to try out the piano painted in blue and decorated with floral print. If you don&#8217;t feel up to playing, it&#8217;s equally nice to sit down and listen to other people try their hand at performing. While you sit on a bench, be sure to look for any signs, as some of them come with an introduction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wooden part of the bench was designed to reuse former pavement. Also, the under part of the bench is made from recycled materials from the former overpass to express the meaning of urban regeneration,&#8221; reads one label for a wooden bench with a bottom made from concrete.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Railroad park in Beijing</span></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for a High Line in Beijing, the closest you can come is probably Jiangfu Park. Located in the northeast part of the city close to the fifth ring, the park opened in 2008. Yet the park has only caught people&#8217;s attention in recent years as more and more bloggers, and sometimes celebrities, such as Chinese actress Guo Biting, have gone to the park to shoot photos alongside the park&#8217;s abandoned railroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Covering an area of 58 hectares, the park is blessed with serene scenic spots and far fewer visitors that other parks in Beijing. You may actually steal a moment of peace, hiding from hustle and bustle of the city by taking a stroll around the lakes or walking down the path in the grooves. However, around the park, beside one of the three venues of the China Railway Museum, there isn&#8217;t much to explore, as most buildings nearby are residential compounds or offices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is that, also in part inspired by the High Line, a nine-kilometer-long linear park will be created along the old tracks of the Jingzhang Railway in northern Beijing, media reported in April. Linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou, the original Jingzhang Railway, opened in 1909, was China&#8217;s first independently-built railway. To preserve and revitalize the icon of China&#8217;s modern industrial civilization, Chinese railway engineer Wang Mengshu proposed the idea of building the park in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the city planning department, with important historical sites along the tracks preserved, the park will run through the Haidian district and be redeveloped to provide more green areas and trails for walking and running. The park is expected to connect 26 communities and the eight nearby universities, benefiting 310,000 people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On September 15, the Wudaokou section of the park opened to the public. Stretching 800 meters and covering 1.7 hectares, the park is dotted with a great variety of plants. According to media reports, volunteers guides are there to teach children more about the plants in the park, while parent-child tree planting activities are also being held at the park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to embracing nature, visitors will also have the opportunity to walk through the history of the Jingzhang Railway. A bamboo-constructed 40-meter gallery in the park showcases photos and texts about the railway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city planning department also held international bidding for design plans for other sections of the park in October. Will this become Beijing&#8217;s version of the High Line, or even something better?&nbsp;</p>

<p>A total of 18 prizes of a regional competition were awarded Wednesday to the best articles as part of the celebration of the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Tunisia.</p>
<p>Many academics, researchers, artists, representatives of civil society as well as students of the Confucius Institute of Tunis took part in the award ceremony held at the headquarters of the Chinese Embassy in Tunis.</p>
<p>This competition includes three categories of prizes for the languages of Arabic, French and Chinese.</p>
<p>Among the jury of the competition are two members of the Tunisian Federation of Newspaper Directors and the Tunisia-China Friendship Association (TCFA), in addition to a diplomat from the Chinese embassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The objective is to provide a platform for exchanges that allow Tunisian and Chinese friends of all levels to actively contribute to the development of relations between China and Tunisia with their ideas and proposals,&#8221; said Chinese Ambassador to Tunisia Wang Wenbin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had received more than 100 articles, the contents of which are very widespread and formulate many suggestions for the development of our relationship in the future, and this has given us immense inspirations,&#8221; added the ambassador.</p>
<p>Ezzedine Ben Salah, member of the jury, revealed to the Xinhua News Agency that most of the candidate articles are of good quality, adding that many Tunisians know China and its diversity of customs and cultures perfectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some candidates have used precise figures in addition to ideas that can help promote bilateral investment between our two countries,&#8221; explained Ben Salah.</p>
<p>Representing the TCFA, Ezzeddine Jebali stressed that the content discovered through these articles has made it possible to get a close look at the great progress China-Tunisia bilateral ties have made over the past 55 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The New York Botanical Garden is rolling into a holiday season with its annual holiday train show, which features architectural replicas of the city&#8217;s Central Park &#8211; one of the most popular urban parks in the US.</p>
<p>Now in its 28th edition, the annual event transports visitors to a miniature metropolis as model trains zip through an enchanting display of more than 175 landmarks in New York, each re-created using items such as bark, lotus pods, acorns, cinnamon sticks and other natural materials.</p>
<p>Six replicas made their debut this year, which are Belvedere Castle, Bethesda Terrace, the Dairy, the Naumburg Bandshell and two graceful pedestrian bridges, according to Victoria Lewis, the botanical garden&#8217;s manager of interpretive content.</p>
<p>&#8220;In real life Bow Bridge is made of steel, but for our version, it&#8217;s twigs and willow bark,&#8221; said Lewis. Dating from 1862, the Bow Bridge is known for its subtle shape which is reminiscent of the bow of an archer or violinist.</p>
<p>The new miniature replicas are arrayed in a tableau with existing Central Park collection, including the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater and the Old Bandstand. In addition, famous New York buildings that are either next to the park or just inside it are on display, including the Plaza Hotel, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Rose Center for Earth and Space, which is part of the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s holiday train show is different from the ones in the previous years as it is held in a temporary exhibition space tailored just for the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show used to be held in the conservatory, the palm dome of which is under restoration.</p>
<p>Lewis said because the temperature is lower in the exhibition space this year compared to that of the conservatory, visitors will see more evergreen plants instead of tropical plants at the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has the effect of being more wintry and it really creates this wonderful indoor winter wonderland,&#8221; said Lewis.</p>
<p>In addition, more than 25 G-scale model trains and trolleys hum along a nearly half-a-mile-long track past re-creations of iconic sites from all five boroughs of New York City, the Hudson River Valley, and other locations in New York State.</p>
<p>The holiday train show has already started and will be running through January 26, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming latest episode of reality show<br />
<em>Encounter,</em> which will be made available on Tencent Video on Tuesday, will see Chinese musicians Aya, Tan Weiwei and Xiao He collect children&#8217;s folk songs in local dialects in Hangzhou and other neighboring areas in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passed down by word of mouth through the generations, children&#8217;s songs in local dialects are facing extinction due to rapid urbanization and social changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the show, the musicians seek out the original songs and then remake them&nbsp; to fit today&#8217;s modern times in order to remind people of the long-unheard voices of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second season of the show currently has a high rating of 7.6/10 on Chinese media review site Douban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s director Zhao Qi said that the second season, which kicked off on October 22, will &#8220;return to humanity itself.&#8221; The first season once raised questions about life and death, topics commonly discussed by many families.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 49-carat diamond which analysts estimate to be worth up to $12 million was among over a dozen jewel-encrusted items snatched from a German state museum in a spectacular heist, the museum confirmed Wednesday.</p>
<p>Publishing a list of the pieces taken in Monday&#8217;s brazen raid, the Green Vault museum at Dresden&#8217;s royal palace said the items stolen included a sword whose hilt is encrusted with nine large and 770 smaller diamonds, and a shoulder-piece which contains the famous 49-carat Dresden white diamond.</p>
<p>Eleven pieces were removed completely, while individual parts of a further three items were also missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dresden White is one of the most precious jewels in the collection of former Saxon ruler August the Strong.</p>
<p>Tobias Kormind, managing director of the diamond retailer 77Diamonds, told AFP that it could be worth up to $10 or $12 million, adding that thieves would have &#8220;hit the jackpot&#8221; if they did take it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of the diamonds would have been in themselves extra special except for the one large Dresden White,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 49-carat diamond was cut in the early 18th century and bought at great expense by August the Strong, then Elector of Saxony, in 1728.</p>
<p>In dramatic CCTV footage released by police on Monday, one of the suspects can be seen using an axe to break into the display case containing three diamond jewelry collections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thieves launched their audacious raid in the early hours of Monday morning, instigating a partial powercut before breaking through a window protected by iron bars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They then headed straight for the display cabinet in what police said was a &#8220;targeted and premeditated crime.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police said Wednesday that after studying the video material, they now believed that there were four perpetrators in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having called for witnesses to come forward earlier in the week, the investigative commission said they had received 205 tip-offs from the public by Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dresden police chief Joerg Kubiessa told broadcaster ZDF that a &#8220;criminal gang&#8221; may be behind the robbery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dresden police said they were also in contact with colleagues in Berlin to explore possible connections to a similar heist in the capital two years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, a 100-kilogram, 24-karat giant gold coin was stolen from Berlin&#8217;s Bode Museum. Four men with links to a notorious Berlin gang were later arrested and put on trial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coin has never been recovered, and fears are growing that the Dresden treasures will also remain lost forever.</p>
<p>With Germany reeling from what Bild and Handelsblatt newspapers called &#8220;the biggest art heist in modern history,&#8221; questions were raised about how the thieves were able to break in so easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;How safe are Germany&#8217;s museums really?&#8221; asked regional broadcaster MDR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, the director of Dresden&#8217;s state art collections Marion Ackermann defended the security measures at the Green Vault, saying that around 8 million euros ($8.8 million) were spent on security ever year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center (SDAC) released eight of its plays for 2020 on Tuesday. This year, the release was done in a &#8220;dramatic&#8221; way by turning the whole of the center into an interactive wonderland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guided by the voice of artists in the headphones, the audience walked through different spaces of the building like the dressing room, the rehearsal room and corridors where excerpts of plays were being put on, one after another. The sounds, lights, shows and actors created a world of immersive and interactive experiences for the audience.</p>
<p>Zhang Huiqing, general manager of the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center, told the Global Times that this tour gives the audience an opportunity to feel the essence of drama in a relaxed and immersive way.</p>
<p>The excerpts of the plays in the immersive tour are from the eight works that the center will put on in 2020, which cover both classic and modern works, such as Beneath the Red Banner by renowned Chinese novelist and playwright Lao She (1899-1966), The Dream of The Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin (1715-63), comedy I Love Peach Blossom, and music drama Letter Home from the War, as well as Under the Roofs of Shanghai, which portrays the lives of Shanghai residents in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Adaptations of foreign works like The Three Musketeers by French writer Alexandre Dumas (1802-70), Death of A Salesman by US playwright Arthur Miller (1915-2005), and Miss Julie by Swedish writer August Strindberg (1849-1912), are also included.</p>

<p>According to Zhang, the center will release 52 plays on diverse subjects in 2020, including both Eastern and Western literature, with classics and original works.</p>
<p>The drama tour, as Zhang said, will also be a new program open to the public for 2020. It encourages the audience to leave their seats in the theater to see the other parts of a play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, what the audience can see is only the last 10 percent of a stage play. We want the audience to know more about people working on stage plays, the history of our center and the history of drama in an interesting way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The center also hosts the Shanghai International Theatre Festival every September, inviting foreign drama groups to perform plays for local audiences.</p>
<p>2020 marks the 25th anniversary of the center. In November 2017, the center started renovating its building on Anfu Road. It reopened to the public in May this year. Compared with the previous version, the public area of the building was enlarged by 40 percent. In addition to plays, the center will also host exhibitions, lectures, art salons and workshops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China National Peking Opera Company (CNPOC) returns to London&#8217;s Sadler&#8217;s Wells Theatre from Wednesday to Thursday this year.</p>
<p>It will be the fifth consecutive year that the CNPOC has come to London, and the company will perform two exceptional shows for UK audiences: a Peking Opera Gala night and the masterpiece<br />
<em>Warrior Women of Yang</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Peking Opera Gala evening is an exceptional opportunity to experience an array of famous Peking Opera scenes, highlighting the various performance aspects of Peking Opera: music, song, mime, acrobatics, stage combat, exquisite costumes and painted faces. The evening will feature performances by the celebrated Peking Opera artists Yu Kuizhi and Li Shengsu, with famous scenes including &#8220;Drunken Imperial Concubine.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursday, the rarely seen spectacular<br />
<em>Warrior Women of Yang</em> will tell a story of grief, courage, patriotism and family loyalty. A cast of over 50 will mesmerize the audience with amazing stage combat and acrobatics. This show was last performed in London in 2015, gaining rave reviews and an invitation to appear on The One Show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liu Xiaoming, Chinese Ambassador to the UK, said that in telling China&#8217;s classical stories through song and dance, Peking Opera is the finest example of traditional Chinese culture and carries the rich cultural heritage of the Chinese nation. &#8220;This jewel of Chinese culture has won the hearts of more and more British people,&#8221; Liu said.</p>
<p>Kevin Zhang, director of Sinolink Productions, the company that helped bring the troupe to the UK, told the Global Times that it&#8217;s a very exciting time for Chinese arts and culture in the UK, as interest among British audiences continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, the stage will be filled with an array of exciting acrobatics, superlative vocals and music amidst the drama of love versus patriotism, a fight against oppressors and the comedy of mistaken identity,&#8221; Zhang noted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bev Lilywhite, production manager with Sinolink, told the Global Times that Peking Opera is a very different art form for Westerners. In order to help the audience better understand the Chinese performances, Sinolink Production brought them backstage by hosting a series of workshops to reveal the finer details of this intriguing art form at Oxford University this year and at the British Library last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peking Opera not only presents the spectacular costumes, face painting make-up and stunning stage crafts to the audience, but also explains the essence of traditional Chinese values. Keeping this ancient Chinese art form alive and sharing its beauty and stagecraft with the world is what we have been working on,&#8221; said Peking Opera artist Yu Kuizhi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peking Opera is a unique art form. To achieve the highest level of performing skill requires lifelong dedication to practicing the art. Most of the artists begin their training at a very young age at opera school before becoming an apprentice and learning from the masters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cultural adventure,&#8221; Lilywhite said, adding that instead of traveling all the way to Beijing, people can enjoy the best Peking Opera performance in London.</p>
