<p>Clive James, the Australian broadcaster, writer, critic and poet who charmed generations of Britons with his humor and wit, has died at the age of 80, his agents said Wednesday.</p>
<p>James died &#8220;peacefully and at home, surrounded by his family and his books&#8221; in Cambridge, eastern England, on Sunday, United Agents said in a statement.</p>
<p>A private funeral attended by family and close friends took place on Wednesday in the chapel at Pembroke College in Cambridge University, where he read English literature as a student in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The charismatic and erudite broadcaster, who left Sydney for England in late 1961 and made his career in Britain, had fought a long battle with leukemia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clive died almost 10 years after his first terminal diagnosis and one month after he laid down his pen for the last time,&#8221; UA said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He endured his ever-multiplying illnesses with patience and good humor, knowing until the last moment that he had experienced more than his fair share of this &#8216;great, good world.'&#8221;</p>
<p>He made his name as The Observer newspaper&#8217;s TV critic for a decade from 1972, where he turned the TV review into somewhat of an art form.</p>
<p>His own hit TV show,<br />
<em>Clive James on Television</em>, fronted with his wise-cracking presenting style, put some the world&#8217;s most bizarre programs under the spotlight &#8211; notably clips of the Japanese game show<br />
<em>Endurance</em>.</p>
<p>Another regular guest was the Cuban singer Margarita Pracatan, who paid tribute on Wednesday to James&#8217; intelligence, talent &#8220;and beautiful way of living.&#8221;</p>
<p>James pioneered the &#8220;postcard&#8221; format of travel documentaries.</p>
<p>He retired from mainstream television in 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Penned his own obituary</strong></p>
<p>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), presented him with a special lifetime achievement award in 2015.</p>
<p>BBC Director-General Tony Hall said: &#8220;Clive James was a clever, witty and thought-provoking broadcaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a huge range of talents and everything he did was essential listening or viewing. He is irreplaceable.&#8221;</p>
<p>James wrote several novels and poetry books and received the Philip Hodgins Memorial Medal, a major Australian literature award, in 2003.</p>
<p>He published several volumes of his memoirs, including<br />
<em>The Blaze of Obscurity</em> about his years in television.</p>
<p>After an unsuccessful operation to remove a cancer on his cheek in February this year, James set about compiling an autobiographical anthology of poems called<br />
<em>The Fire Of Joy</em>, which was finished a month ago.</p>
<p>During his long illness, James penned his own obituary, regularly updating it on his website.</p>
<p>He said it would &#8220;serve as a cheaper obituary than anything most newspapers are likely to have in the freezer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will keep updating it until they carry me to the slab, during which journey I will try to give details of my final medication,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Miller dies, 85</strong></p>
<p>James&#8217; death was announced after the family of theater director Jonathan Miller said he died on Wednesday at the age of 85.</p>
<p>Miller once appeared as a guest on James&#8217; chat show<br />
<em>The Late Clive James</em> in 1988, in which he discussed his love of stationery.</p>
<p>The polymath first found fame in the early 1960s in the revue<br />
<em>Beyond The Fringe</em> with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.</p>
<p>Miller directed theater and television plays, including<br />
<em>The Merchant Of Venice</em> at the National Theatre and six of BBC television&#8217;s Shakespeare plays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our father died this morning peacefully at home with his family around him following a long battle with Alzheimer&#8217;s,&#8221; Miller&#8217;s family said in a statement.</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s National Theatre called Miller a &#8220;legendary figure across theater and opera,&#8221; while the English National Opera said &#8220;his contribution to comedy, theater and ENO in particular was immeasurable.</p>
<p>&#8220;For over four decades Jonathan created some of ENO&#8217;s most celebrated and popular opera productions.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at a New York City police department precinct to turn himself in to face multiple charges related to allegations of sexual assault on Friday. According to reports, Weinstein is facing charges of first-degree rape and third-degree rape in one case, and first-degree criminal sex act in another case. Photo: VCG</p>
<p>A New York judge has ruled that<br />
<em>The Sopranos</em> actress Annabella Sciorra is allowed to testify at fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein&#8217;s trial, court documents showed Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a decision filed late Tuesday, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke also denied a last-ditch attempt by Weinstein&#8217;s attorneys to have predatory sexual assault charges against their client dropped.</p>
<p>Weinstein &#8211; once one of the most powerful men in Hollywood &#8211; has pleaded not guilty to five charges of sexual assault relating to two women.</p>
<p>His trial is scheduled to start on January 6, 2020. He faces life in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>One of the women alleges Weinstein raped her in 2013, while the other claims he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006.</p>
<p>His lawyers had sought to prevent prosecutors from calling a third woman, who alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein over the winter of 1993-94, to give evidence.</p>
<p>Burke rejected their request.</p>
<p>The woman is not named in court documents but it widely understood to be Sciorra, 59.</p>
<p>She helped trigger the #MeToo movement in October 2017 when she told The New Yorker magazine that Weinstein raped her at her home in Manhattan in 1993.</p>
<p>Weinstein, 67, cannot be charged with raping Sciorra because the statute of limitations has expired. Prosecutors hope that her giving evidence as a corroborating witness will strengthen their case.</p>
<p>Weinstein has been accused of harassment and assault by more than 80 women, including stars such as Ashley Judd.</p>
<p>The co-founder of Miramax and producer of<br />
<em>Pulp Fiction</em>, has always insisted his sexual relationships were consensual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy 19th birthday, and hope you are happy every day!&#8221; Roy Wang (Wang Yuan), a member of Chinese boy band TFBoys, sent out birthday wishes exactly at midnight on Thursday on China&#8217;s Twitter-like Sina Weibo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below the text was a photo of Jackson Yee, who is also part of the three-member boy band. In the picture, the smiling Yee holds a photoshopped cake in his hand, apparently, the work of Wang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four minutes later, Karry Wang (Wang Junkai), another member of the band, posted, &#8220;Happy 19th birthday, hope every day in the future goes well and is filled with happiness. Hope you can do more things that you love.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his post, Karry Wang attached a photo of Yee enjoying hot pot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the same thread, Karry Wang later posted, &#8220;Due to a delay in the network in Switzerland, I failed to send out birthday wishes right on time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wang&#8217;s birthday wishes drew Chinese netizen&#8217;s attention. Related hashtags have earned 320 million views and 61,000 posts in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debuting in 2013, the three have been working together for about six years. As the trio have transformed from ordinary teens to China&#8217;s most influential stars, they have appeared less frequently on stage together as they have gradually shifted focus to their individual careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roy Wang is currently studying music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, while Karry Wang is attending the Beijing Film Academy. As for Yee, who is studying at the Central Academy of Drama, he recently gained huge success with his first film role in the coming-of-age drama<br />
<em>Better Days</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Chinese fans also sent out their own birthday wishes, they were warmed by the trio&#8217;s display of friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The relationship among the three &#8211; Karry Wang, Roy Wang and Jackson Yee &#8211; is a kind of brotherhood. They are still so close to each other!&#8221; one netizen wrote in a post on Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>Japanese chicken yakitori kebabs, one of the country&#8217;s most-loved fast foods, will soon be making an appearance in orbit after Japan&#8217;s space agency cleared them for astronaut meals.</p>
<p>The charbroiled chicken meat on skewers and flavored with a variety of sauces is hugely popular in Japan and abroad, and a canned version has just won certification as a &#8220;Japanese space food&#8221; for consumption on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Yakitori joins 34 other Japanese items such as onigiri rice balls, ramen noodles, seaweed soup and cooked mackerel, as Japanese astronauts pine for a taste of home while in orbit.</p>
<p>They can pick what certified Japanese food to bring on their ISS missions, adding to base meals selected by NASA, a spokesman from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) explained on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The approved yakitori will come in two flavors &#8211; soy sauce and yuzu kosho &#8211; green pepper infused with the Japanese citrus fruit yuzu.</p>
<p>But while astronauts may want the full yakitori experience of chewing from a bamboo skewer, strict space rules will make this impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eating from skewers in space would be good&#8230; but the policy is to leave as little waste as possible,&#8221; the JAXA spokesman told AFP.</p>
<p>So the yakitori will be eaten from ring-pull cans with special velcro to keep it from floating away in the microgravity environment.</p>
<p>The approved yakitori cans are manufactured by Hotei Foods, based in Shizuoka, southwest of Tokyo. The company said they expect their cans will blast off when Japanese astronauts leave for the ISS next year.</p>
<p>They won JAXA approval after clearing a rigorous set of criteria such as guaranteeing the food would not degrade even after 18 months at room temperature.</p>

<p>As temperatures dip into the sub-zeros and the cold winds grow stronger, Beijing begins to enter winter. For a lot of locals during this time of the year, there is nothing better than sitting down for some Sic<br />
<em>hu</em>an hot pot with friends or family to let the blazingly hot spices warm up their bodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For people from Guangdong Province in South China, however, this comforting dream would actually be a nightmare as many of them do not like eating spicy food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not some chili peppers should be added to a dish has been a question that Cao Yu and his family constantly wrestled with while he was growing up because his father is from Guangdong, while his mother is from Central China&#8217;s Hunan Province, which is also known for its spicy food. Most of the time, his father relented out of love for his family and everyone ended up eating spicy food. This push and pull among family members, ignited Cao&#8217;s interest in this spicy ingredient, leading him to research how chili peppers were introduced to China and its development in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cao, a researcher from the Center for Migration &amp; Ethnic Studies at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong Province, began by looking into literature references, followed by extensive field research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After years of work, he was finally able to present his findings in his book<br />
<em>The History of Eating Spicy Food in China</em> in June.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book introduces several interesting tidbits of trivia about chili peppers. For instance, it was Afonso de Albuquerque, a Portuguese general, who introduced chili peppers to Asia in the 15th century. After he arrived in India, he started growing some plants he brought from North America, such as tomatoes, cashews, pineapples and chili peppers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book also touched upon the first time that chili peppers were mentioned in Chinese text. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Gao Lian, a writer from Hangzhou in East China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province, wrote in his collection of various prescriptions for a healthy and long life known as<br />
<em>Zunsheng Bajian</em>, &#8220;The white flowers of<br />
<em><em>fan</em><em>jiao</em></em> (Lit: foreign peppers) grow thick. The fruits look like broken ink brushes. They taste spicy, and their red color is rather pleasant.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, rather than being grown for food, chili pepper plants were mainly ornamental.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the word<br />
<em><em>fan</em><em>jiao</em></em> as a clue, Cao looked to the name of dishes to examine the development of chili peppers in China. In Chinese, the words<br />
<em>hu</em>,<br />
<em>fan</em>,<br />
<em>yang</em> were used for ingredients with exotic origins such as<br />
<em>hu</em><br />
<em>jiao</em> (pepper),<br />
<em>hu</em><br />
<em>luobo</em> (carrot),<br />
<em>fan</em><br />
<em>qie</em> (tomato),<br />
<em>fanshu</em> (sweet potato),<br />
<em>yang</em><br />
<em>cong</em> (onion) and<br />
<em>yang</em><br />
<em>baicai</em> (cabbage). Not always, but under most circumstances,<br />
<em>hu</em> indicates that the food was introduced to China between the Qin Dynasty (221BC-206 BC) and Song Dynasty (960-1279), while<br />
<em>fan</em> is associated with the period between the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). After Qing, foreign food introduced to China mostly used<br />
<em>yang</em>. Another item of interest,<br />
<em>hu</em> indicates that the food was introduced to China over land, while<br />
<em>fan</em> and<br />
<em>yang</em> are linked with food that arrived by a marine route to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cao noted that chili peppers, were primarily introduced to China through coastal regions such as the southern provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang and Taiwan, as well as Liaoning Province in Northeast China.</p>
<p>Before chili peppers became part of Chinese people&#8217;s diet, people first discovered its value as a medicine used to alleviate pain. Then later it entered kitchens as an ingredient for dishes. According to the early 18th century Gazetteer of Sizhou Prefecture, &#8221;<br />
<em>hai</em><br />
<em>jiao</em> [lit. sea pepper] is commonly known as<br />
<em>lahu</em>o [lit. spicy fire], the Tu and Miao [two ethnic groups in China] people use it instead of salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A session on The Paper, a Chinese news website, readers and netizens who haven&#8217;t read the book launched a series of intriguing discussions about consuming spicy food in China with Cao.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The habit and capacity of eating spicy food varies from individual to individual. Interestingly, even in Hunan Province, many people don&#8217;t eat spicy food,&#8221; Cao wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Russian cheeses on sale at a shop Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Elvira Kovtun made her first cheese in a pot in her kitchen four years ago.</p>
<p>Kovtun, a housewife and mostly self-taught cheesemaker, became so good that she and her husband decided to turn her passion into a business.</p>
<p>Last month, the high-school sweethearts and parents of three became the first Russians to win a gold prize at the World Cheese Awards, with their &#8220;Peshernyi&#8221; hard cheese taking the honor at the industry&#8217;s equivalent of the Oscars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think this was possible,&#8221; Elvira&#8217;s husband, Vyacheslav Kovtun, told AFP at their small creamery in the industrial town of Korolyov, outside Moscow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I believe in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family&#8217;s success shows how far Russia&#8217;s cheese-making industry has come since President Vladimir Putin banned Western food imports in 2014 in a tit-for-tat measure over the<br />
<a href="http://backup.globaltimes.cn/SPECIALCOVERAGE/Ukrainecrisis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukraine crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Many Russians had developed a taste for French and Italian cheeses prior to sanctions, and Moscow seized the opportunity to put in place an &#8220;import substitution&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>This supported local entrepreneurs trying to set up businesses to replace imported goods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results were often mixed, however, with many customers complaining of the higher price and often inferior quality of the Russian-made products.</p>
<p>But dairy farming and cheese-making have become a bright spot.</p>
<p>According to Russia&#8217;s National Association of Milk Producers, production of cheese and cheese products grew by a third to 670,000 tons a year between 2013 and 2018.</p>
<p>Last week Putin confessed he was &#8220;somewhat worried&#8221; when the first punitive measures were introduced, but the events of the past few years proved that the sanctions had worked to &#8220;our economy&#8217;s advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Ground-breaking&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of artisanal creameries have cropped up across the country and some, like the Kovtuns, are winning top marks from international critics.</p>
<p>Elvira and Vyacheslav, who are both 40 and opened their Korolyov creamery in 2018, had not expected success to come so quickly.</p>
<p>When Elvira called her husband to break the news of the award last month, she was sobbing, Vyacheslav said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got scared. I thought something terrible had happened,&#8221; he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Their creamery&#8217;s website crashed from interest after the awards were announced and the winning cheese sold out until April 2020.</p>
<p>More than 3,800 cheeses from 42 countries were in competition at this year&#8217;s World Cheese Awards in Bergamo, Italy, where products are awarded with supergold, gold, silver or bronze prizes.</p>
<p>At last year&#8217;s competition no Russian entries were recognized but this year the Kovtuns&#8217; Cheese &amp; Beer creamery and three other Russian cheesemakers won a total of nine awards.</p>
<p>John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food which organizes the competition, said the Kovtuns had put Russia on the international cheese map.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our gold winners are some of the best in the world and only a small percentage of entries do this well,&#8221; Farrand said, praising their Peshernyi cheese for &#8220;delivering a true sense of terroir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Russia&#8217;s lack of the cheese-making heritage of France or Italy could in some ways be an advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Free from the pressures of tradition, the country&#8217;s artisans can innovate and produce something ground-breaking and unique,&#8221; Farrand said in written comments to AFP.</p>
<p>Elvira said she spent several years perfecting Peshernyi and the recipe is a closely guarded secret.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Cheese fever&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>With its nutty and fruity hints, Peshernyi matures for seven months in a cellar and sells for 1,800 rubles ($28) a kilogram.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t last a day without cheese,&#8221; Elvira said, placing curd grains in moulds with the help of an assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are all my babies. I love them.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kovtuns now make 20 soft and hard varieties including camembert and truffle brie, employing a handful of staff.</p>
<p>They produce cheeses five days a week but demand far outstrips supply.</p>
<p>Yevgeny Barabanshchikov, a chef and connoisseur of European cheeses who traditionally shunned Russian-made dairy products, went to meet the Kovtuns as soon as he learned of their success in Bergamo.</p>
<p>&#8220;My interest is professional,&#8221; said Barabanshchikov, executive chef at Integrita, a top supplier of high-quality imported food.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very pleased for them because I know the cheese-making technology,&#8221; Barabanshchikov told AFP, stressing that hard cheeses require a lot of investment, expertise and good-quality milk.</p>
<p>One of the people who has most championed the Kovtuns is their competitor Oleg Sirota, arguably Russia&#8217;s best-known cheesemaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more good creameries we have, the more people will trust us,&#8221; said the 31-year-old head of the Union of Russian Cheesemakers.</p>
<p>He himself took his first gold at a regional competition in France in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sirota recalled how Vyacheslav, who owned a construction firm at the time, ambushed him at a gas station outside Moscow in 2016, saying he wanted to learn the business of cheese-making and was ready to sell his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was stunned,&#8221; Sirota said.</p>
<p>They now help each other, plan to expand their operations and praise Putin for creating what Sirota calls Russia&#8217;s &#8220;cheese fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vyacheslav said Russia&#8217;s modern cheesemakers are continuing a long tradition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not inventing anything new,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We made a lot of cheese a hundred years ago and exported it to Europe and the Baltics. We are now reviving our forefathers&#8217; recipes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Healthy food sold in Israel will be marked with green stickers starting from January 2020, Israeli Ministry of Health announced on Sunday.</p>
<p>The marking will be carried out by food manufacturers, importers, and marketers, and food that cannot be labeled will be marked by a green sign posted next to it.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the purpose of green labeling is to assist consumers in choosing food that fits the principles of healthy nutrition as recommended in Israel.</p>
<p>The conditions for inclusion in healthy food groups are based on minimal processing and avoidance of harmful substances such as excess saturated fat, sugar, and salt, per the decisions of a scientific committee appointed by the ministry.</p>
<p>Accordingly, products that may be marked are milk, white cheese, and yogurt with up to 5 percent fat, including tofu, olive oil, whole wheat pasta, raw fish, and fresh eggs among others.</p>
<p>The green mark, which will be voluntary in the first phase, joins a previous decision by the ministry, requiring the red marking of unhealthy products starting January as well.</p>
<p>These are foods with a high amount of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium.</p>
<p>Besides, Israeli food manufacturers will be required to change the nutrition facts lists on the packaging so that components such as sodium and fat appear ahead of protein, and that the sugar amount will include &#8220;translation&#8221; for the number of spoons.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">A cup of sake Photo: VCG</p>
<p>The sommelier lingers over her glass, taking in the bouquet while clutching a spoon of caviar and cucumber jelly. The union of food and beverage is &#8220;magical&#8221;, she declares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Paz Levinson, head sommelier at the high-end Anne-Sophie Pic restaurant group, is not savoring a sought-after vintage from Bordeaux or Bourgogne. She is holding a glass of sake, the humble Japanese rice drink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sake works very well with French cuisine,&#8221; says the Argentine.</p>
<p>France is only the 11th largest market in the world for sake, where the total sales remain below two million euros ($2.2 million) per year. But its consumption is soaring, with imports increased by some 160 percent between 2012 and 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anne-Sophie Pic, the head chef and owner of the eponymous restaurant group has won eight Michelin stars in her career, and she is a sake convert. She first used the drink in her recipes before adding it to the wine list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other hotels and restaurants are equally keen.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>&#8216;Sake boom&#8217;</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p></strong>In a growing market, entrepreneurs have sniffed an opportunity &#8212; French sake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two companies already produce the drink domestically &#8212; both in wine-growing regions. Takuma Inagawa, a French-educated Japanese brewer, has a different idea. He wants to start production in an old warehouse in Fresnes, a town just south of Paris.</p>
<p>Despite his Japanese heritage and the industrial surroundings of Fresnes, he is keen to imbue the drink with the best French traditions. &#8220;We wanted local, French rice,&#8221; says Inagawa, whose warehouse holds hundreds of bags marked &#8220;Camargue rice&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The French are ready to accept sake but, with the trend towards a sustainable environment, there is a potential for French sake,&#8221; says the 31-year-old, whose company Wakaze was set up in Japan making flavored versions of the alcohol.</p>
<p>He hopes eventually to use Burgundy oak barrels to age some of his product &#8212; believing this will please French and Japanese drinkers, as he has already produced a run of 17,000 bottles in his homeland.</p>
<p>Sake began to get popular in France about 15 or 20 years ago, according to expert Sylvain Huet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He says a &#8220;sushi boom&#8221; led to a &#8220;sake boom&#8221; in the restaurants and dining rooms on Rue Sainte-Anne, a Parisian street near the Louvre known as Little Tokyo because of the proliferation of Japanese businesses.</p>
<p>But the impact was initially limited to that small area of Paris.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Sake &#8216;evangelist&#8217;</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huet though believes France has got a taste for the drink: &#8220;Over the next 10 years, the market in France will increase fivefold, even tenfold,&#8221; he predicts.</p>
<p>Huet set up his own Sake Fair in 2014 and says he catered to over 5,100 visitors in this year&#8217;s edition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, sommelier Xavier Thuizat has also been enchanted by the drink, establishing his own tasting competition &#8212; &#8220;Kura Master&#8221; &#8212; in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He says he hit an impasse six years ago, unable to find the right drink to go with certain foods.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find the solution,&#8221; he explains, adding that despite coming from the wine-producing region of Burgundy, France&#8217;s famous drop just did not cut it.</p>
<p>Then a Japanese man told him to try sake, which set him on a path to becoming an &#8220;evangelist&#8221; for the Japanese drink.</p>
<p>While these French enthusiasts treat sake as a high-end product for gastronomes &#8212; that is not the case for everyone.</p>
<p>The word sake in Japanese is generic, referring to many types of alcohol. And sake has also been adopted by Chinese brewers as a useful label for their cheap sorghum brandy.</p>
<p>But the French converts are sanguine. &#8220;I now bring sake as a gift when I go back to Burgundy,&#8221; says sommelier Thuizat. &#8220;The reactions are good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Music industry mogul Scooter Braun said Friday his dispute with megastar Taylor Swift over her music catalogue has left his family receiving &#8220;death threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 29-year-old pop artist began publicly sparring with Braun this summer over his company&#8217;s purchase of her former label, Big Machine Label Group, which gave him a majority stake in the master recordings of her first six albums.</p>
<p>Last week, Swift &#8211; known for her calculating social media strategy &#8211; said on Tumblr that Big Machine heads were &#8220;exercising tyrannical control,&#8221; claiming they were preventing her from performing at an upcoming awards gala and releasing a Netflix documentary including songs from her early catalogue.</p>
<p>In the post she pleaded with her fans and fellow artists to back her cause.</p>
<p>Braun had not publicly spoken out on the matter, but early Friday dropped a lengthy Instagram post saying Swift&#8217;s appeal had resulted in &#8220;numerous death threats directed at my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I assume this was not your intention but it is important that you understand that your words carry a tremendous amount of weight,&#8221; Braun wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;While disappointed that you have remained silent after being notified by your attorney 4 days ago of these ongoing threats, I&#8217;m still hopeful that we can fix this.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Victoria&#8217;s Secret fashion show in New York on November 8, 2018 Photo: IC</p>
<p>It was one of the most popular fashion shows for 20 years, but US lingerie brand Victoria&#8217;s Secret is canceling its annual extravaganza amid controversy and weak financial results in the #MeToo era.</p>
<p>The decision, in the offing since the summer, reflects a shift towards brands seen as more empowering of women, such as singer Rihanna&#8217;s, and comes after several years of declining TV viewership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brand is often accused of objectifying women and has been struggling to appeal to a younger generation of lingerie shoppers who increasingly prefer simpler, less sexualized designs.</p>
<p>Victoria&#8217;s Secret has also received negative publicity surrounding its owner&#8217;s links to Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in prison this year while awaiting trial on charges he trafficked underage girls for sex.</p>
<p>The fashion show, in which models parade around with angels&#8217; wings on their backs, first aired in 1995. It was broadcast around the world, with the venue changing from year to year.</p>
<p>US viewers have declined by almost a third since 2014, from 9 million then to 3.3 million in December 2018.</p>
<p>The decision to scrap it was confirmed by Stuart Burgdoerfer, finance director of parent company L Brands, during a conference call with analysts about the brand&#8217;s latest quarterly results.</p>
<p>Victoria&#8217;s Secret once defined glamour, attracting the most sought-after supermodels like Gisele Bündchen and Naomi Campbell.</p>
<p>But Burgdoerfer added that the brand, which was the jewel in L Brands&#8217; crown for many years, had not been able to achieve a new lease on life despite recent leadership changes.</p>
<p>Its sales have been slipping in the past two years, weighing on the bottom line of L Brands which reported a net loss of $252 million in the third quarter, against a $43 million loss a year earlier.</p>
<p>Victoria&#8217;s Secret sales were just over $1 billion in the third quarter of 2019, down seven percent from the same period in 2018. More than 30 of its stores have closed since February.</p>
<p>The brand seems to be paying the price, in part, for some marketing blunders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cast in the show&#8217;s 2018 edition was more cosmopolitan than usual, following criticism that the brand had little regard for diversity in its choice of models.</p>
<p>But days after last year&#8217;s event, marketing director Ed Razek ruled out using transgender or plus-size models in future shows.</p>
<p>His ill-judged comments came as demands for greater diversity on catwalks increases. They sparked an outcry on social media and he later apologized.</p>
<p>More serious perhaps is that the brand has regularly been mentioned in news articles about disgraced hedge fund manager Epstein, who was accused of multiple sexual assaults on young women, many of them teenagers.</p>
<p>Epstein, who was arrested in July, had been close to L Brands founder Leslie Wexner. Wexner was thought to be Epstein&#8217;s biggest financial backer for a while after hiring him as a financial advisor in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Wexner said he severed ties with Epstein after the latter&#8217;s conviction for sex crimes with underage girls in 2008.</p>
<p>Moreover, countless women who accused Epstein of sexual assault said they were recruited to work for him on the false promise that he would get them jobs as Victoria&#8217;s Secret models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Models&#8217; rights group the Model Alliance hailed the show&#8217;s cancelation, noting that 100 models had signed a letter calling on Victoria&#8217;s Secret to join its &#8220;Respect&#8221; program aimed at preventing sexual assault and fostering fair working conditions.</p>
<p>With Victoria&#8217;s Secret on the slide, Rihanna is the new star of the lingerie market with her Savage X Fenty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brand is big on diversity and seeks to project an image of women as the masters of their own bodies and desires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid and Cara Delevingne paraded its lingerie at New York Fashion Week in September, signaling how popular the brand has become.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the first time on the runway that I felt really sexy,&#8221; supermodel Bella Hadid told Elle magazine.</p>
