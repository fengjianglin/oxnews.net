<p>Eschewing the traditional romantic seaside or flowery background, a couple in Central China took their wedding photos in the middle of zebra crossing of a busy intersection before being chased away by the traffic police.</p>
<p>A traffic surveillance video posted by Knews on Sina Weibo shows several staff of the photography company in Hubei Province laying out a red blanket in the left turn lane of the busy intersection, completely ignoring passing and oncoming traffic and pedestrians.</p>
<p>The bride in her white wedding dress and the groom in his black suit walk into the flow of traffic as the photographer snaps their photo. They even pose sitting and lying on a blanket in the middle of the road. A number of pedestrians were confused by the scene and passing cars had to slow down to avoid hitting them and each other.</p>
<p>After being alerted to the near mayhem by passers-by, traffic police finally shooed the couple away. The report did not mention if the couple and photographer were fined for their actions.</p>

<p>Wang Zhenxi is an extremely busy support therapist who says she counsels more than 800 mistresses a year and even helps them find true, monogamous love.</p>
<p>Wang says she uses four mobile phones to take calls from women seeking her help. &#8220;I meet clients 330 days a year,&#8221; said Wang in a seven-minute video posted by the Zhengzhou Evening News that features a lot of tears.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken Wang says she first befriends her clients who include brokenhearted mistresses and angry spouses whose partners have cheated on them. She will even introduce her clients to new lovers and help them start a new life.</p>
<p>In the video, Wang is seen paying a visit to a 27-year-old woman who had been in a relationship with a man 15 years her senior. She had just had an abortion and her paramour had disappeared from her life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know he was married and has a child until his wife came looking for me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when I decided to break up with him but he got down on his knees and begged me not to leave him, saying that he didn&#8217;t love his wife. I&#8217;m softhearted and ended up staying with him,&#8221; said the woman through teas</p>
<p>Wang has introduced the woman to a man who has promised to marry her and the couple are seen sitting together holding hands.</p>
<p>Many Chinese netizens consider this profession as necessary and beneficial.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good job, which can help not only a family but also mistresses who don&#8217;t find a correct way,&#8221; one of Sina Weibo users commented.</p>

<p>A series of unfortunate and uncomfortable events involving a woman&#8217;s entry and exit points for food resulted in her getting 12,000 yuan ($1,703) in compensation from her dentist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The woman in Northeast China said she had botched dental surgery which caused her extreme case of hemorrhoids, for which she had surgery four years ago, to once again rear their ugly head &#8211; so to speak.</p>
<p>The woman surnamed Chen said her first treatment at a dentist in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, only exacerbated problems with her teeth.</p>
<p>Chen told Knews her dentist damaged her gums during her first visit and had to have additional surgery to replace a tooth. During that visit the replacement tooth popped loose and she swallowed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a panic, Chen took a powerful laxative that was utterly effective over the next four days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I needed to go to toilet seven or eight times a day, which led to my hemorrhoid returning,&#8221; Chen said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The series of blunders by the dentist enraged Chen and she demanded compensation but is still not satisfied with the 12,000 yuan payout she received.</p>
<p>Chen&#8217;s tooth was finally repaired at another dental clinic, according to the report of Knews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually swallowing a broken tooth is no big deal, it will reappear at the other end in a few days,&#8221;a netizen wrote.</p>

<p>Blackhall Colliery has one claim to fame &#8211; its beach featured in the climax of the Michael Caine film &#8221;<br />
<em>Get Carter</em>.&#8221; Apart from that, it is like many struggling former mining villages in northeast England.</p>
<p>But the village on the County Durham coast is now at the center of a mystery &#8211; as bundles of cash keep turning up in the street.</p>
<p>Durham Police said a total of ￡26,000 ($33,500) had been found over the past five years &#8211; 13 packages of ￡2,000 in ￡20 notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;These bundles are always left in plain sight such as on pavements and discovered by random members of the public who have handed them in,&#8221; said Detective Constable John Forster.</p>
<p>The latest discovery on Monday was the fourth this year, he added, speculating that a Good Samaritan could be dropping off the cash parcels. Forster, who said inquiries had so far drawn a blank, praised the &#8220;incredible community spirit&#8221; of the locals who had handed in the cash&nbsp;</p>

<p>Angered by foot-dragging by an insurance company in paying out for a burial policy, a family in South Africa took matters into their own hands &#8211; they hauled the corpse to the company&#8217;s offices.</p>
<p>In a video clip that has gone viral on social media, two women can be seen schlepping a blue plastic body bag into an insurance office as stunned clients look on.</p>
<p>After impressing the employees with this unusual act of fact-checking, they leave the premises and helped by several other people drag the bag into the boot of a car.</p>
<p>A man asks them whether their row over the payout has been resolved.&#8221;They&#8217;ve just paid now, that&#8217;s why we are removing&#8230; the body now,&#8221; a woman can be heard to reply.</p>
<p>The incident took place last Friday at a branch of the Old Mutual insurance company in KwaDukuza, north of the city of Durban.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Old Mutual said there had been an &#8220;incident at this branch (which) whilst isolated is regrettable.&#8221;</p>

<p>President Donald Trump&#8217;s spokeswoman claimed Tuesday that Barack Obama staffers left behind catty notes in White House offices for the incoming administration, telling them &#8220;you will fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Press secretary Stephanie Grisham&#8217;s comment, first made to a CNN reporter, prompted swift denials from ex-Obama officials and a torrent of online mockery from Trump opponents.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came into the WH, I&#8217;ll tell you something. Every office was filled with Obama books and we had notes left behind that said &#8216;you will fail,&#8217; &#8216;you aren&#8217;t going to make it,'&#8221; a tweet from CNN&#8217;s Abby Phillip quoted Grisham as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a complete and utter lie,&#8221; tweeted Obama administration lawyer Daniel Jacobson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite the opposite &#8211; we left them briefing books to try to help with the transition as much as possible,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director at Obama&#8217;s National Security Council, called it &#8220;an outrageous lie&#8230;. Shameless and disgusting.@PressSec should be fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faced by the heated denials &#8211; and snarky online gags about the &#8220;you will fail&#8221; prediction proving true &#8211; Grisham said her remark had been over-played.&#8221;I don&#8217;t know why everyone is so sensitive!&#8221; she told AFP.</p>

<p>Let sleeping bears lie? Not in Poland this New Year&#8217;s Eve, where a row is brewing over the decision to relocate an annual televised event with fireworks and partying to the slopes of the country&#8217;s main ski resort.</p>
<p>By Tuesday more than 27,000 people had signed a petition organized by a local newspaper, which broke the story after discovering the plan at a council meeting in late October.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters walked across the city of Zakopane with a fake bear on a stretcher on Saturday, days after the mayor confirmed the relocation, calling on him to stop the process.</p>
<p>TVP public television station, which organizes the show, criticized what it called &#8220;pseudo-ecologists&#8221; and argued that sports events had been held in the area in the past without any problems.</p>
<p>An expert from the park confirmed to AFP that there were Carpathian brown bears in the area, though he said precise numbers were not known.</p>
