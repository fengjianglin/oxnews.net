<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Soaring pork prices in China continued to soften last week as the country rolled out multiple measures to stabilize hog production.</p>
<p>From Nov. 25 to 29, the average pork price index in 16 provincial-level regions tracked by the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/20.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Agriculture</a> and Rural Affairs came in at 40.95 yuan (about 5.8 U.S. dollars) per kg, down 3.5 percent week on week.</p>
<p>This is the third consecutive week that the pork price index has retreated since the beginning of November.</p>
<p>The price retreat came as the Chinese government has been taking multi-pronged measures to boost supply, including increasing subsidies to restore hog production, releasing frozen pork reserves and expanding pork imports.</p>
<p>The ministry urged related departments to put great emphasis on restoring hog production and take various measures to ensure pork supply and stabilize pork prices for the coming New Year and Spring Festival holidays.</p>
<p>Prices of pork, a staple meat in China, have been soaring in recent months, mainly affected by African swine fever and cyclical factors.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 3.8 percent year on year last month, mainly driven by soaring pork prices, which rose 101.3 percent year on year in October, contributing nearly two-thirds of the CPI growth.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Foreign investors have been reinforcing their purchasing power on Chinese bonds, official data showed, with analysts giving credit to the reform and opening-up in China&#8217;s bonds market, and better interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign investors jumped at Chinese bonds in the first 11 months of the year, with cumulative net purchases reaching 970.2 billion yuan ($137.85 billion), data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) showed on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, transactions by foreign investors came to a total of 567 billion yuan, up 5 percent month-on-month and 127 percent year-on-year, CFETS said. That meant the total cumulative net purchases from foreign investors approached nearly 1 trillion yuan in the first 11 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>November was the 12th consecutive month that foreign investors overweighed Chinese bond holdings with continuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also notable that the number of foreign investors new to China&#8217;s interbank bond market in the first 11 months &#8211; 1,331 &#8211; has surpassed the total number in previous years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reforms and opening-up in China&#8217;s bond market have enabled more foreign investors to enter China&#8217;s financial market, as reflected by the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Shanghai-London Stock Connect and the country&#8217;s great efforts to build its offshore financial market, Liu Xuezhi, a senior economist at the Bank of Communications, told the Global Times on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the risk of investing overseas is increasing with a declining yield rate under the pressure of the global economic downturn … but China&#8217;s bonds have relatively good returns on investment,&#8221; Liu noted, adding that foreigners&#8217; increasing purchasing power shows their confidence in China&#8217;s economy and financial development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2019 marks the lowest-performing year for global bond yields, but the interest rate spreads between Chinese bonds and foreign bonds have surged to an historical peak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 10-year bond spreads between China and the US have surpassed 140 basis points, which is relatively high in history, Reuters said in August.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The autonomous region&#8217;s export volume during the period was 100.2 billion yuan, up 19.9 percent, while its import volume soared to 31.3 billion yuan, up 63.1 percent, according to the customs authorities of Urumqi, the regional capital.</p>
<p>In the first 10 months, Kazakhstan topped the list of Xinjiang&#8217;s major trade partners, with trade volume between the two growing by 28.2 percent to 60.2 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Xinjiang&#8217;s trade with Kyrgyzstan, Australia, Pakistan, Britain, Argentina and Vietnam also showed fast growth, according to the local customs authorities.</p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Gree&#8217;s stock price closed high on Monday morning at 59.96 yuan ($8.65), after Gree said it will be without a controlling shareholder as the private equity firm Hillhouse Capital becomes the biggest shareholder of Gree Electric on Monday. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Hillhouse Capital will take over 15 percent of Gree&#8217;s shares at a price of 41.6 billion yuan ($5.9 billion).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">As Hillhouse Capital takes over Gree&#8217;s shares, the company is now without an actual controlling shareholder and left with a new management system, which is deemed as a modern shareholding system. Numerous companies are under such a system, including Pingan and TCL, according to a report by yicai.com </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">Market participants generally believe that with such a large quantity of investment, the cash flow will lead to higher dividend requirements from major shareholders. It is expected that Gree&#8217;s dividend rate will increase in the future, the report said. </span></p>

<br />China&#8217;s central bank continued to pump cash into the money market in November to meet liquidity demand from financial institutions.</p>
<p>A total of 600 billion yuan (about 85.4 billion U.S. dollars) was injected into the market via the medium-term lending facility (MLF) last month to maintain liquidity in the banking system at a reasonably sufficient level, according to the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC).</p>
<p>The funds will mature in one year at an interest rate of 3.25 percent.</p>
<p>Total outstanding MLF loans reached 3.56 trillion yuan as of the end of November.</p>
<p>The MLF tool was introduced in 2014 to help commercial and policy banks maintain liquidity by allowing them to borrow from the central bank using securities as collateral.</p>
<p>In November, the PBOC also injected 4.8 billion yuan of funds through pledged supplementary lending to the China Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Agricultural Development Bank of China.</p>
<p>Another 62.25 billion yuan was lent to financial institutions through the standing lending facility to meet provisional liquidity demand.</p>
<p>The central bank has adopted open market operations more frequently to manage liquidity in a more flexible and targeted manner.</p>
<p>China has pledged to keep its prudent monetary policy &#8220;neither too tight nor too loose&#8221; while maintaining market liquidity at a reasonably ample level in 2019.</p>

<p>Heihe has registered 30,000 households for switching to natural gas for heating. It will take one year to complete full coverage of the gas network in the city, according to the company.</p>

<br /> Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin inaugurated the China-Russia east route natural gas pipeline by video link-up on Monday sending a signal that energy and cooperation in other sectors between the two countries are becoming the key to boosting multilateralism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entering service the same day, the pipeline will help Russia export up to 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to China, according to an article posted on the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) website on Monday.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s almost one-third of China&#8217;s total natural gas imports in 2018. About 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia will be delivered to China in 2020 and will be gradually increased to 38 billion cubic meters per year, the article said.</p>
<p>CNPC is responsible for the construction and management of the project within China: Stretching from Russia&#8217;s Siberia to China&#8217;s Yangtze River Delta, the pipeline covers 8,000 kilometers, of which 5,111 kilometers fall within Chinese borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project extends from Heihe in Northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province to North China&#8217;s Hebei Province and finally to Shanghai in East China across a total of nine provinces and municipalities.</p>
<p>Russia will deliver a total 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas to China over the 30 years of contract, media reports said.</p>
<p>Following 20 years of negotiations, China and Russia reached the more than $400 billion contract in May 2014, the CNPC article read.</p>
<p>A China-Russia west route and China-Far East pipelines are also under discussion, the article said.</p>

<p>
<strong>Win-win deal</p>
<p></strong>Mutual benefit drove the two countries&#8217; energy development strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A &#8220;rapidly rising China needs a stable and reliable energy supply, while an increasingly powerful Russia also needs to participate in the world&#8217;s largest market,&#8221; the CNPC article said.</p>
<p>The pipeline will help stabilize China&#8217;s natural gas supply and guarantee the country&#8217;s energy security, especially if the situation ever changes for ocean transportation of natural gas in certain waters like the South China Sea, Jin Lei, an associate professor at the Beijing-based China University of Petroleum, told the Global Times on Monday.</p>
<p>The construction of the pipeline fits the country&#8217;s strategic energy blueprint, Jin noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline system in northwestern China, a China-Myanmar oil and gas pipeline in the southwestern region and about 20 liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the eastern region,&#8221; Jin said.</p>
<p>The construction of the China-Russia pipeline will make up for the lack of a cross-border natural gas pipeline in northeastern China, he said, noting that the China-Russia pipe is a strategic energy supply channel.</p>
<p>China is the world&#8217;s largest natural gas importer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, China imported 90.39 million tons (about 125.9 billion cubic meters) of natural gas, data from the General Administration of Customs shows.</p>
<p>The annual import of 38 billion cubic meters from Russia would account for nearly one-third of China&#8217;s annual total natural gas imports, and Russia is expected to be China&#8217;s largest supplier.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chinese demand, the pipeline will become an important channel for Russian exports, Jin said, especially if problems impede Russia&#8217;s natural gas export to Western Europe.</p>
<p>Europe is a big export market for Russian gas, with Gazprom alone exporting about 202 billion cubic meters to European countries and Turkey in 2018, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But those exports can suffer during political tensions.</p>
<p>The US and European countries oppose construction of Nord Stream 2, a Russian gas pipeline to Western Europe, over security concerns, The Los Angeles Times reported in June.</p>
<p>As a major resources export economy, Russia saw its natural gas production hit a record 725 billion cubic meters in 2018, of which 225 billion cubic meters were exported, Xinhua reported in January, citing Russian energy minister Alexander Novak.</p>
<p>The project deepens China-Russia relations, Chinese observers noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US has become a net exporter of oil for the first time in decades, noted Wang Yiwei, a director of China&#8217;s Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing.</p>
<p>China-Russia energy and financial cooperation boosts multilateralism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia is not only a business partner, but more of a strategic partner in politics and diplomacy,&#8221; he told the Global Times on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of the pipeline project will step up China-Russia cooperation in other aspects including regional cooperation and cyber-security, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the international backdrop that the US continues to contain China by even sacrificing its own interests, China supporting Russia is supporting itself,&#8221; Wang said.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s economy, second-ranked globally in nominal GDP terms and the largest based on an adjustment of GDP for purchasing power parity (PPP), will remain among the best performers in the global economic landscape in the upcoming year, China market watchers said.</p>
<p>Whether the economy can maintain 6 percent growth or not, it&#8217;s poised to retain its leading position and continue to serve as the locomotive of the global economy, they noted.</p>
<p>Green shoots of recovery are expected to be seen in both domestic and overseas markets in 2020, Guo Xiaobei, a researcher with China Minsheng Bank, told the Global Times, estimating the Chinese economy will post full-year expansion of around 6 percent in the next year.</p>
<p>Guo cited China&#8217;s implementation of various reform measures such as the ramped-up opening of the economy at an accelerated pace, monetary easing by major economies, hopes for a thaw in China-US trade tensions, and the UK&#8217;s effort to block a no-deal<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/990443.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brexit</a>.</p>
<p>That suggests China will continue to power up the global economy, and the feat won&#8217;t be challenged by the possible scenario of growth falling below 6 percent, analysts said.</p>
<p>According to data from the World Bank, China&#8217;s GDP in current US-dollar terms totaled $13.61 trillion in 2018, second only to the US with $20.49 trillion. Japan held the third spot with $4.97 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going by GDP in PPP terms, China was already the largest economy with $25.36 trillion last year, followed by the US with $20.49 trillion and India with $10.50 trillion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nation also excelled as measured by annualized growth rates. India was the fastest-growing major economy with 6.98 percent expansion in 2018, ahead of China with 6.6 percent growth. The US economy was in third place with 2.86 percent growth, according to World Bank statistics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With US growth expected to moderate in 2020 and India still struggling to recover from the shock of its economy slumping to a more-than-six-year low of 4.5 percent in the July-September period from 7 percent a year earlier, the estimates that China will remain the power of the global economy seem to hold up well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has topped the global rankings of contributions to global economic growth since 2006, according to a report released in August by the National Bureau of Statistics.</p>

<p>Though China has witnessed slow economic growth amid the China-US trade war, it has stabilized its job market thanks to the country&#8217;s tertiary industries, which have created more positions during the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading efforts.</p>
<p>The country&#8217; s steady employment situation refutes claims by US President Donald Trump that China had lost 3 million jobs due to the trade war. Experts gave credit to the country&#8217;s industrial upgrading and the appearance of new forms of flexible employment, saying the stable job market shows the resilience of China&#8217;s economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies in tertiary sectors told the Global Times that they had created millions of new job opportunities over recent years, and they have great demand for professional talent in IT, procurement, operations and services to support development in the future.</p>
<p>Industry reports showed that live-streaming, a new industry rising amid the fast development of the country&#8217;s internet sector, has generated a total of 4 million new jobs for the country; the food delivery industry has generated over 20 million job opportunities in both direct and indirect forms &#8211; some of which haven&#8217;t yet been factored into the official National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the downward pressure on the economy, one of the main factors necessary to maintaining the stable job market is the function of tertiary industries as a reservoir of employment,&#8221; said NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong, noting that tertiary industries cover a broad spectrum, with a growing number of enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 55 percent of employed people worked in tertiary industries in China, NBS said on November 20.</p>
<p>More and more Chinese graduates hope to work in tertiary industries, in companies such as those working with cutting-edge technology or the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>23-year-old postgraduate student Zhang Yali is looking for a job in the internet industry in Beijing. Majoring in journalism and communications, she would prefer a product-operations or user-operations position in an internet company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having commenced her job hunt in August, Zhang has applied for eight jobs in large Chinese internet companies such as tech conglomerate Tencent and ride-hailing services provider Didi Chuxing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though Chinese internet companies had mass layoffs at the end of last year, I still want to enter this industry because it is a driving force for economic development and working in this industry will be promising,&#8221; Zhang said. She knows the work will be challenging and require staying up late, but the industry will enable her to catch up with the pace of China&#8217;s economic restructuring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first 10 months of the year, China created 11.93 million new urban jobs across the country, meeting 2019&#8217;s annual target of more than 11 million new urban jobs in advance of the deadline. The unemployment rate in urban areas dropped 0.1 percentage points to 5.1 percent in October, mainly due to the improving employment status of graduates, NBS said.</p>
<p>Li Chang&#8217;an, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said that the improving employment absorption capacity in the services industry had effectively resolved employment difficulties in secondary industries.&nbsp;</p>
