<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: GT</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, another show of US&#8217; nasty long-arm jurisdiction and hegemony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China and the US are close to a phase one trade deal with broad consensus having been reached. The trade talks could be a driving factor for the US Congress to promote approval of the act. They see the legislation as a card to further suppress China, intending to make the country bow to their wishes.&nbsp; In this context, both US Congress and the White House are pleased to see the act become a pernicious law against China, although the two sides would still have divergences on details and to what extent they should carry it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be it human rights or democracy, Trump is not interested in Hong Kong. However as both chambers of US Congress have passed the bill by near unanimous margins, by signing on the act, Trump is not likely to peeve any anti-China politician on both sides. Given the uncertainties Trump is facing because of the impeachment inquiry, it is understandable that he will woo, rather than irritate right-wing anti-China Republican senators like Marco Rubio to defend him during the impeachment. Therefore, signing the bill can bring no harm to Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in a statement on Wednesday, Trump said he &#8220;signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China and the people of Hong Kong,&#8221; which suggested that he won&#8217;t let his hands be tied by the Congress in dealing with China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the first time a US president has given leeway, as some of Congress&#8217; legislations were somewhat ultra vires. Trump is no exception. He has suggested that he will exercise discretion in deciding whether and to what extent the bills&#8217; provisions are implemented.</p>
<p>This reflected a phenomenon in US domestic political struggle — with the Congress and the White House mutually making compromises and concessions. It cannot be ruled out that the Congress and the president play a double act in the future, which is also a common practice of Washington.&nbsp; The Congress passes an egregious law and then administrative departments play the card in talks and consultations to coerce the other parties to give in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a commonly seen trick of Washington when it is dealing with foreign affairs and China. For instance, during former president Bill Clinton&#8217;s tenure, the US linked so-called human rights affairs with China&#8217;s most-favored-nation-treatment. Going back further, the US enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979 to keep meddling in China&#8217;s internal affairs. For years, Washington has mastered the trick to reap maximum gains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is bound to affect China-US relations as the US Congress uses a domestic law to intervene in China&#8217;s internal affairs, sanctioning Hong Kong and even threatening to revoke its special customs status. This will be a setback for Hong Kong as an international financial hub and affect foreign investment in the city, which also hurts US companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The act will have a far-reaching and harmful impact. But how effective the card is for Washington depends on various factors. If the unrest in Hong Kong calms down in a short time, US evaluation of &#8220;the government of Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomous decision-making&#8221; or &#8220;application of sanctions&#8221; will lose its &#8220;legitimacy&#8221; and rationality. If China-US tensions prevail, the Hong Kong card will be repeatedly used. If the China-US relations can go back to normal, the White House will at least think twice before using the card, as it has to weigh the costs and benefits. Otherwise, relations between the two countries may tank and affect the trade consultations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum up, Trump has signed another evil law that intervenes in China&#8217;s domestic affairs and violates the country&#8217;s sovereignty by using Hong Kong as a stick. However, in deciding how to use the stick and whether it will take the US where it wishes, Washington has to think carefully because the move would probably backfire.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>The emergence of China is challenging some of the existing norms of the international system. These norms found place in the system during and immediately after the Cold War. US political scientist Francis Fukuyama has been forced to modify his theory of &#8220;end of history.&#8221; South Asia is adapting to the new reality. But India is looking backward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The countries on the Indian subcontinent are looking at China not only as a facilitator of infrastructure development and economic partnership but more as a security provider and source of political stability in the region. Much of Indian strategic thinking revolves around winning back estranged neighbors without seriously pondering over the causes of the estrangement.</p>
<p>India being alienated by some neighbors is not only due to China&#8217;s rise, but also because of New Delhi&#8217;s handling of ties. Instead of engaging in counterbalancing Beijing, New Delhi must rethink its neighborhood policy, not lose the geostrategic advantage in the region and trusted partners, so as to fulfill the common aspiration of an economically prosperous and peaceful region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the political sphere, New Delhi must learn from Beijing the art of engaging in dialogue and partnership with the government of a country, rather than a party. A simple study of India&#8217;s neighborhood policy reveals that New Delhi is more comfortable with a particular party and when the opposition forms the government in a neighboring country, India finds itself in an embarrassing situation. For example, the victory of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in Sri Lanka&#8217;s presidential election on November 16 has made the Indian establishment cautious as his party is believed to tilt toward China. In Bangladesh, India is at ease with Sheikh Hasina&#8217;s Awami League while being hostile to the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entrusting all its support and confidence in one party or person is not a guarantee of their favorable treatment or policies toward New Delhi. India&#8217;s military intervention to protect Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of Maldives did not oblige him from favoring China. Thereby, India must respect the mandate of the people and build a sustainable partnership with the government of a neighbor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smaller neighbors are interested in forging a security partnership with China based on their security assessments. New Delhi needs to deeply contemplate over changed strategic thinking of neighbors to reset its policy directions and priorities. No amount of economic assistance or aid, which is mostly considered by Indian neighbors as alms, can persuade them to trust the Indian establishment.</p>
<p>Infrastructure development and economic connectivity are new tools in diplomacy. South Asian countries are deprived of good infrastructure and economic growth. Under the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, Beijing is helping them build new highways, railways and other infrastructure necessary for economic growth. New Delhi, too, is bargaining with Beijing to attract investments. But at the same time, New Delhi&#8217;s push for the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and the Indo-Pacific Strategy are putting these small countries in dilemma to choose from multiple options. Therefore, these countries are now taking a leaf out of India&#8217;s foreign policy during the Cold War, which advocated nonalignment but hedging to maximize national interests. New Delhi must not push these countries to choose sides but let them decide what is right for their people and country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Delhi&#8217;s dwindling commitment to South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in the backdrop of a tense relationship with Pakistan further eroded the credibility of India as a genuine and responsible actor in the region.&nbsp; Thereby, rejuvenating SAARC will go a long way in restoring faith and confidence in the regional leadership of India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People-to-people exchanges as well as cultural and geographical proximity have their own disadvantages. Speaking the same language quickly disseminates hate messages across the border, instilling and deepening existing hatred. Therefore, political leaders and media must desist from provocative statements. In case of China-India tensions, some messages are lost because of the language barrier. Translations have a minimal impact unless they are not issued in a common language, English.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, India&#8217;s neighborhood policy should be independent of any power game in the region to win over its neighbors but to formulate a common strategy under SAARC to bring shared prosperity in the region.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: VCG</p>
<p>China&#8217;s State Council Information Office released an annual report titled &#8220;China&#8217;s Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate Change (2019)&#8221; on Wednesday. The report said China has basically reversed the situation of the country&#8217;s rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on Tuesday released its Emissions Gap Report 2019, saying greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise in the last decade. The report said, &#8220;Despite contributing significantly to the slowdown in global emissions from 2014 to 2016,&#8221; China&#8217;s emissions are now rising again.</p>
<p>But the UN should see that although China&#8217;s emissions are rising, the trend of rapid growth has been reversed. Despite the recent rebound in China&#8217;s coal power demand, China has adhered to a clean coal power supply system with strict standards. China is marching toward its target of net zero emissions, but this needs to be gradually accomplished.</p>
<p>China has been actively dealing with climate change and taking responsibility as a major power. This is completely different from the US stand. Since Chinese Premier Li Keqiang &#8220;declared war&#8221; on pollution in 2014, China has been improving its industrial efficiency and increasing investment in renewable energy. China has also been fulfilling its promises under the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/958199.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Agreement</a>. These are all outstanding accomplishments that should be applauded.</p>
<p>But it seems that the US has not shouldered its obligations at all. In the UNEP report, the US greenhouse gas emission per capita in 2018 was still much higher than that of the global average. In early November, US President Donald Trump formally started the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement. Trump also skipped a session devoted to climate change at the G7 summit in August, saying that he is not going to lose the &#8220;tremendous wealth&#8221; of the US &#8220;on dreams&#8221; and &#8220;on windmills.&#8221;</p>
<p>But can that &#8220;tremendous wealth&#8221; help the US escape the extreme weather and natural disasters worldwide? No. In January, extreme cold weather hit Midwestern US, causing tens of deaths and many frostbite victims. In July, millions of Americans suffered from a dangerous and widespread heat wave, leading to power outages in the country. Such extreme weather not only hurts people, but also costs US companies more for repairs. Right now that climate change also harms the US economy. Is the Trump administration still not going to do anything about it? No country is an island when facing climate change. If the US insists on caring about nothing but its own short-term interests, it will be ruining its own future as well as that of others.</p>
<p>China-US cooperation has faced many difficulties after Trump assumed office. But the two countries still have opportunities to cooperate on climate change and many other hot global issues. As the 25th UN Climate Change Conference will be held in Spain on Monday, we hope the US, as a superpower and the largest economy, can meet China halfway on climate change.</p>
<p>China and the US have the common need to deal with climate change. The two countries now have different understandings of their responsibilities, but the Trump administration still should understand that when facing extreme weather, cooperation is the only way out. This is not only for the sake of the American people, but more importantly, for the future of mankind.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Former Bolivian president Evo Morales Photo: IC</p>
<p>Exactly one year ago, reputed Professor of international relations Shi Yinhong gave a lecture on China-US relations at Renmin University of China&#8217;s campus in Suzhou, East China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason, the lecture was also being attended by several military personnel from all over the world who were in China to participate in exchange programs. There were some military men from Latin America. Most Latin American people have this feeling of being part of a common identity no matter which country we come from. So, when we come across someone from the region, we always exchange words.</p>
<p>I struck a conversation with a Bolivian guy. He was not white, not indigenous, probably a &#8220;mestizo&#8221; mixed. I was curious about what he thought of young Bolivian military personnel in China. After over 10 years since Evo Morales assumed office as the president of Bolivia in 2006, I was expecting him to come out with his impression of a more progressive military, considering he was clearly neither white nor rich, as the major traditional elites in Bolivia are. But his answer was exactly the opposite, and I soon realized it was better not to go deeper into the talk and said a diplomatic goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reaching home, I wrote to a good friend who was for years the minister of autonomies of Bolivia and the founder of an anti-imperialistic school for the armed forces, &#8220;I found one of your countrymen from a military exchange program in China. I was surprised with the degree of cipayism (the indigenous people who worked in the military to serve France, Portugal, and the UK to fight the Spanish empire) and his uncritical devotion for the US&#8230; I hope that the graduates of the anti-imperialist school have at least slightly transformed their world views!&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t tell me&#8230; Surely there are still many soldiers who long for the guidelines of the US. If they have a higher degree [of education], they are more pro-US. Petty officers and cadets are more oblivious to these imperial influences.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that time, for most Latin American people, and for both of us, it was impossible to think of a coup d&#8217;etat in the 21st century, and less so in a stable country like Bolivia. The Southern American country was economically growing, fighting strongly against poverty, and uplifting indigenous people that were considered, since colonial times, second or third class citizens. Morales was the first indigenous leader in Bolivian history to make it to the presidency, which sounds surprising considering that 60 percent of the country&#8217;s population is indigenous. After the coup on November 10, Morales and former vice president Álvaro García Linera went into exile in Mexico.</p>
<p>Recently, García Linera said that &#8220;for me, democracy isn&#8217;t just elections &#8211; I&#8217;m talking about a deeper conception of democracy. Democracy is equality, the broadening of rights, the de-racialization of authority and the rights that people enjoy. For this reason, there can be no transformation process if it is not democratic,&#8221; in an interview with Jacobin, a New York-based magazine, adding &#8220;What happened is that the traditional middle classes saw themselves as being &#8216;invaded&#8217; by popular and indigenous layers who now had university education and savings, and now had greater capital of various kinds to take on public posts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right after the coup, the illegitimate &#8220;provisional government&#8221; of Jeanine Añez (a white congresswoman who comes from a party with less than 4 percent of the votes) and the cipayist armed forces came to power. It is worrying that they exonerated the armed forces of any crime committed in the &#8220;defense&#8221; of this process, enabling an uncontained repression by the military against the population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &#8220;due obedience&#8221; is against the law. This assault on the democratic process in Latin America by the military had been common in the 20th century. The support and training to the militaries by the US is well documented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These assaults have been interrupting the development process of the region and adding more problems to the already complex situation. Most of the heads of the governments were defending foreign interest, leading to rising foreign debt, and attacking the national industry.</p>
<p>However, in the 21st century a repetition seemed a distant possibility. In the early 2000s, new forms of intervention were more common in the region as the political impeachments and the lawfare &#8211; the use of the legal system to act against the political opponent, combining the judicial system and the media directing public opinion for damaging or delegitimizing one&#8217;s rivals.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it seems that the recent release of former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from jail after a highly questionable judicial process, and after electing Alberto Fernandez and Cristina Kirchner as president and vice president in Argentina, this &#8220;soft-intervention&#8221; encountered some limits. Military repression against the people is increasing in some countries.</p>
<p>It seems that the region, once again, will need to pay attention to the military and their connection with foreign powers.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</p>
<p>In October 1943, Max Harris, the editor of Angry Penguins, then Australia&#8217;s leading avant garde modernist literary magazine, received a package of poems supposedly written by a deceased poet, Ern Malley. But as it turned out, Malley was a fictitious figure and the poems were in fact forged by a couple of critics by piecing together fragments from dictionaries, quotations, plays and a report about the breeding grounds of mosquitoes. The trusting Harris showered high praise on the nonexistent poet, calling him &#8220;one of the most outstanding poets that we have produced&#8221; in Australia. The hoaxers later revealed the shocking truth that the bunch of randomly concocted fake poems, which had won the loudest applause from the celebrated modernist magazine, were aimed at shaming and ridiculing the modernist literature in Australia at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Penguins could be gullible. Those poor creatures could be easily misled and fooled by some flippant teasers. But it is really astounding that the most prominent Australian media of today, such as The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and 60 Minutes, could jump in excitement at an apparently fabricated fairy tale of a convicted fraudster, Wang Liqiang, claiming to be a defecting Chinese spy who told Australia&#8217;s top-level intelligence agency, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), about &#8220;how China had funded and conducted political interference in Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong.&#8221; More surprising is that ASIO claims to be paying serious attention to an equally bizarre drama alleging some Chinese scheme to plant a Chinese-Australian car dealer, surnamed Zhao, in Canberra&#8217;s federal parliament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the most amateurish readers would gawk in disbelief at the imposter&#8217;s outlandish account that Wang, at the age of 26, had assumed important powers to make decisions and give orders related to some 007-style theatrical operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His preposterous tale is a bizarre coincidence with the conspiracy theory about the car dealer, portraying a sinister image of China threatening Australia&#8217;s security and sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cold War was over about 30 years ago, but the ghost of ideological battle has been obstinately hovering Down Under awaiting resurrection. The fact that the media and some political figures in Australia could be so excited about such implausible cloak and dagger stories is indeed embarrassingly preposterous, indicating some Australians&#8217; nostalgia and a deep-rooted antipathy toward China and the Chinese way of governance. The voracious journalistic vultures don&#8217;t need any prompting and goading to swoop upon such tittle-tattles leaked to them by some intelligence agencies with their manipulative hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul Keating, former Australian prime minister, recently said &#8220;a group of national security agencies which are now effectively running the foreign policy of the country&#8221; spoiled the &#8220;subtleties of foreign policy and the elasticity of diplomacy.&#8221; He also condemned Australian media&#8217;s sensationalism, ignoring its public duty while &#8220;preferring instead to traffic in side plays dressed up with cosmetics of sedition and risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The anti-China camp in Australia consists of only a small cluster of extremists, but they have been stirring up one wave after another of anti-China frenzy as part of a scheme connived in the US to contain and counter China&#8217;s development domestically and globally. Espousing and campaigning for Washington&#8217;s global strategy, Canberra has literally been acting as Washington&#8217;s deputy sheriff in a number of cases to secure the latter&#8217;s supremacy and hegemony in the region.</p>
<p>It serves the interest of some security agencies to invent a foreign enemy, but such reckless fabrication would only jeopardize Australia&#8217;s national interest. It is not in Australia&#8217;s interest to decouple with China, which would only lead to unforeseen economic disaster for Australia, and cost China dearly as well. In the backdrop of the current US-lunched trade war against China, it is to the benefit of both China and Australia to strengthen the collaborative partnership.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has on a number of occasions asserted that Australia-China relations could withstand any challenges. This is very positive and constructive. A more independent China policy is important for Australia in today&#8217;s world of uncertainties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This understanding resonates in Paul Keating&#8217;s speech, in which he urges Canberra to pursue a more balanced policy to manage bilateral relations with Beijing. We hope this course will not be derailed by some fraudsters and storytellers.</p>

<p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. This amounts to typical US interference in China&#8217;s Hong Kong affairs.</p>
<p>Being part of China, Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the country&#8217;s governance. Washington has no jurisdiction over Hong Kong, but the legislation tries to legitimize its right to affect Beijing&#8217;s policies on the city, which is a clear violation of Chinese sovereignty. Imagine if China takes action to interfere in the US presidential elections or adopts a policy regulating how Canberra should treat its ethnic minority groups, will there be a strong backlash?</p>
<p>It is clearly not the time for China to reason with the US, but to be rational in China-US conflicts. We must prevent more Hongkongers from being misled by US craftiness, which will eventually harm their interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington is determined to turn Hong Kong into a new front to strategically pressure Beijing. Some beguiled Hongkongers have been taken over by the illusion that the law could help their city gain a higher degree of autonomy, as they imagine Beijing would be deterred by the US legislation, and thus make major concessions that are not in line with the Basic Law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China&#8217;s key countermeasure against the law is to further clarify the fundamental rules of the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle, completely dispel Hong Kong radical opposition&#8217;s pipe dream to realize &#8220;absolute universal suffrage,&#8221; correct their misunderstanding of the principle, and firmly repulse US assessments of the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>We must leave no room for collusion and interaction between Hong Kong&#8217;s radical opposition and the US government. They may act alone and bear the costs, but shall never dream of jointly coercing Beijing.</p>
<p>It is the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress that holds the power of interpreting the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Facing the US&#8217; potential move to cancel Hong Kong&#8217;s special trade status with this law, Hong Kong society needs to behave in accordance with the Basic Law on major issues and cooperate with the central government to offer no pretext for the US to use this law. If the radical opposition interprets the Basic Law in an unconstitutional manner, mainstream society in Hong Kong must stand up against them and stop them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Hong Kong society has force strong enough to resist constitutional arrangements, thus helping the US resort to its law and causing further damage to the city&#8217;s business environment, it will be Hong Kong society&#8217;s misfortune. The city will suffer some pain and make necessary adjustments to its economic structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s special trade status is stipulated by the Basic Law, rather than awarded by the US. As long as the society sobers up and works hard with the motherland&#8217;s support, no external forces can truly wield influence over its destiny.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the law also threatens to sanction Hongkongers who do not cooperate with the US. This will suppress neutral space for people with different ideas and further tear the city apart. The only way to maintain the solidarity of Hong Kong is to resist US provocation and prevent more people from joining hands with the opposition for fear of US sanctions. Efforts to fight the forces colluding with the US should be stepped up, and the corresponding laws need to be improved. There is no way to allow traitors to prevail and patriots to suffer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;One country, two systems&#8221; is China&#8217;s independent constitutional arrangement and US intervention damages its external environment. Hong Kong society should be vigilant. To maintain &#8220;one country, two systems,&#8221; the Chinese mainland and the HKSAR need to work together. Anyone who colludes with external forces to undermine &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; must pay a heavy price.</p>

</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City and billionaire media mogul, jumped into the race for the Democratic US presidential nomination on Sunday, in a bid to &#8220;defeat [US President] Donald Trump and rebuild America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though he has entered the presidential race, Bloomberg may not aim to win the election, but to reunite the Democratic Party. He may seek to shift the party&#8217;s left-leaning ideology and proposals to the center in an attempt to expand the voter base of the party. The consensus between Bloomberg and the Democratic Party is defeating Trump and bringing the party back to power.</p>
<p>If Bloomberg hoped to win the presidential election, he would not jump into the campaign midway. US society and even the Democrats may not approve of his unconventional practices such as not participating in previous Democratic debates and vowing to refuse political donations.</p>
<p>In March, Bloomberg announced that he would not run for president. What changed his mind? The reason might lie in the seemingly low chance of a Democratic victory in the 2020 presidential race.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A national poll carried out days before the Democratic primary debate on November 20 on MSNBC, a US television network, showed that former vice president Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Senator Elizabeth Warren were the top three candidates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the three candidates have charisma or attractive political proposals. Biden is generally moderate, but not good with words. He may be more appropriate to be appointed as vice president. Warren and Sanders, two left-wing candidates of the Democratic Party, seem to be excessively underlining populism. Many people in the US disapprove the Democrats&#8217; far-left policies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the party is also filled with internal squabbles. Going by all this, the Democratic Party has a high probability of losing the election.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bloomberg may hope to gain the support of median voters by proposing moderate and inclusive political ideas. However, whether he can achieve this goal remains to be seen.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell how much impact Bloomberg running for president will have on Trump. The impeachment investigation has not yet hurt Trump&#8217;s reputation badly. Some of Trump&#8217;s populist moves such as immigration control are popular among certain Americans. The US economy has been doing well. US stocks closed at all-time highs on Tuesday. As the incumbent president, Trump seems to have more leverages as well as a larger base of voters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the US-launched trade war against China has hit US business groups, Trump has gained the support of many unemployed blue-collar voters, who previously supported the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Democrats are known to represent the interests of American middle class. It remains a challenge whether Bloomberg, a billionaire, can make political proposals without being seen by ordinary people as patronizing. Furthermore, at the age of 77, Bloomberg is even older than Trump. His personal appeal to the electorate tends to be limited as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the prospects of Bloomberg&#8217;s presidential race do not appear bright.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>To refute US fears that Huawei would send sensitive data records to the Chinese government, German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier said on Sunday that &#8220;Germany still did not impose any boycott&#8221; on the US despite the US National Security Agency&#8217;s surveillance of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell hysterically fought back by saying that equating the US government action with that of the &#8220;Chinese Communist Party&#8221; was &#8220;an insult&#8221; to the US troops who &#8220;help ensure Germany&#8217;s security&#8221; and &#8220;the millions of Americans committed to a strong Western alliance.&#8221; He said there is &#8220;no moral equivalency&#8221; between China and the US.</p>
<p>First of all, Grenell&#8217;s remarks were an insult to China and the 1.4 billion Chinese people. It was an extreme statement full of discrimination against another kind of value, race and civilization. Indeed, it is not equivalent to compare China with a hegemonic and inconsistent government full of double standards.</p>
<p>Grenell was also insulting and despising Germany and Europe by forcing European countries to choose sides between China and the US. Washington has been forcing Europe to divide on many issues, and this is completely against European countries&#8217; interests. More and more countries have seen US double standards: While the US is hyping Huawei&#8217;s unfounded spying concerns, it is also spying on its European allies. As time passes by, fewer countries will follow the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US will insist on targeting Huawei worldwide. However, Germany&#8217;s reaction shows that the results may not be as optimistic as the US had expected. During the Christian Democratic Union of Germany&#8217;s convention on Friday and Saturday, Merkel said Germany should not rule out any company due to political problems. Indeed, countries should focus more on objective factors, such as companies&#8217; technological security and standards, instead of ideology or political system.</p>
<p>Despite US provocation of China-Europe relations, China is determined to promote relations with Europe. For example, Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045945.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmanuel Macron</a> expressed on November 6 their support for early conclusion of an ambitious and balanced China-European Union investment agreement. Many leaders from Central and Eastern European countries have expressed their will to deepen cooperation with China. As Merkel said in 2017, Europe has to take its destiny in its own hands.</p>
<p>China has never told Europe to follow China&#8217;s steps and fight the US. It is the US that has been trying to rope in European countries to oppose China. Washington should not turn Europe into a battlefield of China-US disputes. This is contempt for Europe.</p>
<p>It seems that some US politicians can never get rid of their Cold War mind-set. But 21st century conditions are different from those in the Cold War era, and today&#8217;s China is not like the Soviet Union decades ago. China is not a threat to any country. China and Europe are victims of US hegemony and protectionism, and neither of them can bear multilateralism breaking down. When facing the US government&#8217;s words and deeds, China and Europe must jointly maintain the free and open global investment environment to deal with the challenges.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: IC</p>
<p>With the pan-democracy camp capturing more than half of the 452 seats in the 2019 Hong Kong District Council elections, the city has come to a political turning point. It was an election held amid constant violence in the city. The result could be somewhat distorted, but the outcome can be seen as so-called mainstream public opinion. However, it also showed that level-headed thinking of the city is on the wane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe most Hongkongers would like to see chaos continue in their city. They wish for change, but their indignation and unwise choices would further push the city toward an abyss. The outcome of the election would mislead outsiders into believing that the so-called mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong is in favor of violence and confrontation while going against integration with the Chinese mainland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what concerns me more is Hong Kong getting lost.</p>
<p>The jurisprudence and fidelity to the Basic Law and &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle have not been established in Hong Kong, a city that still completely follows the &#8220;colonial&#8221; system under the common law and adopts practices consistent with the West. This is one reason behind the results of the latest district council elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government failed to deal with local youngsters according to the rule of law. The youth believe they can find justice by breaking the law. From the 2014 illegal<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/885027.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occupy Central movement</a> to the current unrest sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill, the political landscape of Hong Kong has been increasingly polarized and radicalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The central government promotes rule of law in Hong Kong but it cannot persuade Hongkongers to follow its lead as the &#8220;two systems&#8221; concept has been misunderstood. Meanwhile, local groups&#8217; appeal for &#8220;democracy and welfare&#8221; targets the contradictions and demands of people under Hong Kong&#8217;s capitalist democracy.</p>
<p>Moreover, Western forces have been exercising influence in the city, which makes some Hongkongers believe they can challenge the &#8220;one country&#8221; principle.</p>
<p>When China-US ties were better and the &#8220;two systems&#8221; were getting along with each other, Hong Kong enjoyed the benefits of globalization. But when the world&#8217;s two largest economies clashed and the globalization order is changing, the city is facing an epochal puzzle &#8211; Where will it go?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The election result reflected a majority of Hongkongers&#8217; misunderstanding of &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle, the Basic Law, the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the community of shared future for mankind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The citizens of Hong Kong have only come across anti-China information in a world with freedom of information; they cannot perceive the changes in relations between China and the world although they stand at the pinnacle of globalization; they choose to wait and see and even run away when the Chinese nation is in a &#8220;golden era&#8221; of rejuvenation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever be the result of various elections in Hong Kong, the city&#8217;s autonomy and China&#8217;s sovereign right on the city will never change. The Hong Kong opposition can continue to force public opinion and collude with foreign forces to achieve political goals, but it is the city &#8211; not pro-establishment camp or the central government &#8211; that will suffer.</p>
<p>As Hong Kong tends to close its doors, it will continue losing attraction for elites from the Chinese mainland and the rest of the world. As a result, the city&#8217;s status as a financial hub and its reputation for higher education would be seriously affected. The window won&#8217;t be open too long for Hong Kong to seize the opportunity under the framework of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Hong Kong returned to the motherland, China has become the world&#8217;s second-largest economy and a power to shape the global order in the 21st century. Even if it positions itself on the opposite side of the central government, Hong Kong won&#8217;t influence much of the country&#8217;s development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All walks of life in Hong Kong should calm down and introspect after the district council election: Can violence really solve the problem? Does Hong Kong&#8217;s future lie in keeping distance from China&#8217;s national strategy and system? Will its unconditional and unlimited trust in the West really benefit the city?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easy to forge &#8220;public opinion&#8221; by spreading fear and violence. However, it is also an obligation of elites to educate and guide people to think rationally and jointly figure out the best way to realize local interests. Regrettably, Hong Kong&#8217;s governing and cultural elites have abandoned this responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Hongkonger should be absent in the great discussion about the city&#8217;s future. How Hong Kong can better integrate within the country is a topic more valuable than the &#8220;public opinion&#8221; trend in a specific election.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Henry Kissinger Photo: VCG</p>
<p>Henry Kissinger, former assistant for national security affairs and US secretary of state, spoke at the annual Gala Dinner of the National Committee on US-China Relations on November 14 in New York City, warning a permanent conflict between Beijing and Washington would end in &#8220;a catastrophic outcome,&#8221; which &#8220;will be worse than the world wars that ruined European civilization.&#8221; The remarks received widespread attention among media, scholars and policymakers in both China and the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kissinger is a key figure behind the normalization of diplomatic ties between China and the US in the 1970s, and has since then devoted himself to fostering better ties between the two countries. This background should be taken into account when analyzing his latest statement. The celebrated diplomat&#8217;s remarks are rational because he has grasped the essence of the new changes in China-US relations &#8211; with the rapid development of China&#8217;s comprehensive strength, the gap between China and US is narrowing fast. China has become a potential peer competitor of US in many aspects. &#8220;There is no doubt many aspects of the evolution of China are challenging to the US,&#8221; Kissinger said, adding &#8220;it never happened before that two major countries in different parts of the universe were in similar positions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kissinger&#8217;s latest remarks echo the opinion he raised on multiple occasions in recent years: Both countries have changed, so have their relations, and there is no going back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Kissinger is acutely aware of the horrible situation that current tensions between China and US will lead to. Contrary to the view of John Mearsheimer, reputed US international relations scholar, who believes China cannot rise peacefully and &#8220;there is obviously little room for status quo powers in a world where states are inclined to look for opportunities to gain more power,&#8221; Kissinger believes that leaders from both sides can find a way to resolve the differences and avoid catastrophic consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His remarks are also quite constructive, since Kissinger expressed his opinions and suggestions on China-US relations in a relatively neutral perspective. As a person who understands China much better, he has faith in China&#8217;s peaceful development path. Therefore, he did not point a finger at China on what to do in ties with the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He mentioned that &#8220;it&#8217;s no longer possible to think that one side can dominate the other&#8221; and both countries &#8220;have to get used to the fact that they have that kind of a rivalry.&#8221; His statement can be seen as a subtle reminder for US policymakers that they should not tell China what to do like they used to and they need to deal with the challenges that China might pose in a more rational way. Kissinger added, &#8220;When we started this relationship, it was a strategic one. There were differences at the beginning of the relationship. Nevertheless, we&#8217;ve learned to live with each other for many decades.&#8221; He was trying to say that both countries should treat bilateral relations from a strategic perspective, and should agree to disagree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the current era, China-US relations play the most significant role for both countries&#8217; diplomacy. Effective strategic management is thus needed for the bilateral relationship.</p>
<p>The China-US strategic dialogue should be promoted. The bottom line for future relations needs to be drawn. The two sides should respect each other&#8217;s core interests and keep their strategic promises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US should think carefully while trying to contain China. China has no intention to replace the US as the world leader. However, Washington sees Beijing as a threat due to its hegemonic mind-set and launched the trade war against the latter. Since China consistently follows the path of peaceful development, the key to improving bilateral relations is in the hands of the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China needs to have a clearer vision of the characteristics and features of today&#8217;s China-US relations. China needs to not only boost its confidence, but also give the US enough time to reflect on its containment of China. The US needs to mature in terms of strategy during the process. Washington might not accept China&#8217;s rejuvenation now, however historical logic has already proved that the most practical and feasible solution to deal with major power relations is through mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and healthy competition.&nbsp;</p>
