<p>Doctor Lama&#8217;ala&#8217;s consulting room is always the busiest one in the Beijing Hospital of Tibetan Medicine.</p>
<p>The hospital, located in Beijing&#8217;s Chaoyang district, is not big, but patients arrive from all over China with big hopes Tibetan doctors can cure their illnesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;He extended my father&#8217;s life for one year. My father suffered from lung cancer,&#8221; a middle-aged man donning a sleek black leather jacket told the Global Times in his heavy Beijing accent.</p>
<p>Sitting on the sofa in Lama&#8217;ala&#8217;s consulting room, he asked the doctor to prescribe medicine for his ailing wife. Lama&#8217;ala is not fluent in Putonghua, so his colleague Xiangjiang Duojie, a young doctor in his office, serves as his interpreter. &#8220;You need to wait for several days until you can have the medicine again,&#8221; Xiangjian Duojie told the Beijing couple patiently.</p>
<p>After the couple left, a Tibetan Lama in a brick-red colored robe came in the consulting room. He travelled all the way from Southwest China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous Region to treat his lumbar spine problem.</p>
<p>The monk carried his magnetic resonance photos that were taken in another hospital.</p>
<p>After examining the photos, Lama&#8217;ala feels for the monk&#8217;s pulse and begins the treatment plan.</p>
<p>Lama&#8217;ala&#8217;s short build and tanned complexion are characteristic of many people from China&#8217;s high plateau regions.</p>
<p>Some view the Tibetan doctor&#8217;s work as exotic. For Lama&#8217;ala, it is heritage. A yellow-covered Tibetan calendar brochure is always by his hand. Before applying treatment, he charts the patient&#8217;s birthday on the calendar to choose an auspicious date.</p>
<p>A patient came to his office with some dried wolf stomachs, an ingredient common in traditional Tibetan medicine, and requested Lama&#8217;ala to check them for his use.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Follow the master</span></strong></p>
<p>Lama&#8217;ala&#8217;s small consulting room was covered with scarlet silk banners inscribed with his patients&#8217; appreciation.</p>
<p>But right in the middle, on the window sill sits a picture of his teacher, Cuoru Cilang, a Tibetan medical master who died 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Lama&#8217;ala was born into a herdsmen family in Qamdo, Tibet in 1966. At the age of 16, he went to Cuoru Monastery, a 13th centery Gagyu temple, and became a monk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is common in our hometown that each family would have a son to be a monk. It is for this life and next life and to expiate the sins of parents, siblings and people in this world,&#8221; he said, according to a people.cn report.</p>
<p>Lama&#8217;ala started studying Tibetan medicine when he was 17 and continued researching for 25 years, he told the Global Times.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Medical diagrams inside the Beijing Hospital of Tibetan Medicine Photo: Li Hao/GT</p>
<p>&#8220;Entering a monastery is like entering a college,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Monks start from the &#8220;10 Ming Studies,&#8221; a basic course containing 10 subjects such as logic, medicine, crafts, poetry, astrology and drama.</p>
<p>Each of them eventually chooses their own field of study according to their talents and interests.</p>
<p>Lama&#8217;ala often had to do chores during his first 12 years at the temple, but he considered it a process to mold a faithful and kind spirit.</p>
<p>In 1988, Lama&#8217;ala was arranged to serve Master Cuoru Cilang. He stayed by his side until 2014, when he accompanied his master to Beijing to treat his disease.</p>
<p>After his master passed away, Lama&#8217;ala became a doctor at the Beijing Hospital of Tibetan Medicine.</p>
<p>Lama&#8217;ala gradually gained fame with his medical skills. He is good at treating nephropathy, diabetes as well as dermatosis.</p>
<p>He is also one of the few Tibetan doctors who know the technology of making &#8220;zuotai,&#8221; the process of Tibetan remedies to remove toxic elements in minerals.</p>
<p>Lama&#8217;ala has been invited to many countries to treat and give speeches on Tibetan medicine.</p>
<p>He has been to the US, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the UK and France. Several months ago, he visited Moscow, St. Petersburg and Irkutsk in Russia, where Tibetan medicine is gaining traction.</p>
<p>The doctor said that even though he lives in a big city, he still retains a monestary-style routine and reads scriptures every day.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana">Doctor&#8217;s philosophy</span></strong></p>
<p>The merits of Tibetan doctors are deeply influenced by the Tibetan Buddhism and doctors are respected by residents.</p>
<p>Lama&#8217;ala memorized the Four Medical Classics, or rgyud bzhi, in two years. The Four Medical Classics are the most important classics of Tibetan medicine compiled in the 8th century.</p>

<p>Lama&#8217;ala said that all medical systems are based in science. He also believes that some illnesses are related to the metaphysical need and scriptures to guide cures. &#8220;But the real monsters do not exist. Some illnesses are caused by psychological problems, which would need psychological treatment and relief,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>He further explained that astrology is also a part of Tibetan medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tibetan medicine see a human the same as a grass and a tree. So humans must follow the nature and life is related to the four seasons, which is related to the stars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do the proper things at the proper time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tibetan doctors also must study logics and crafts. &#8220;The surgery tools in Tibetan medicine are crafted by the doctors themselves, as well as the medical Tangka. Therefore, Tibetan doctors are not only masters of medical knowledge, but also of art.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chinese veterinarians successfully completed the world&#8217;s first cataract surgery on a snow leopard on Tuesday in Northwest China&#8217;s Qinghai Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linghan, an older snow leopard, was recovering from the cataract surgery on his right eye at the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Wildlife Zoo (Xining Zoo) on Tuesday morning, according to a statement zoo officials sent to the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Linghan was anesthetized and went into surgery at 11:45 am.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Veterinarians finished the procedure in roughly three hours. Linghan woke up 20 minutes after the surgery.</p>
<p>An intraocular lens was implanted in his right eye after the cataract was removed.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center> </p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Linghan, the snow leopard during surgery Photo: Courtesy of Xining Zoo</p>
<p>Jin Yipeng, vice president at the College of Veterinary Medicine at China Agricultural University, performed the surgery with his team.</p>
<p>Jin said the procedure went smoothly and explained Linghan&#8217;s recovery will depend on the animal&#8217;s condition but he was &#8220;cautiously optimistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The procedure marked the first cataract surgery performed on a snow leopard in the world, according to the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The surgery will not only improve Linghan&#8217;s living quality, but also provide experience in rescuing other wild animals,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>Linghan was injured during his rescue from the wild in Qinghai&#8217;s Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in January.</p>
<p>He was sent to Xining Zoo immediately afterwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts learned Linghan was 11 years old, roughly the maximum age for his species.</p>
<p><center><br />

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Linghan, the snow leopard Photo: Courtesy of Xining Zoo</p>
<p>Since February, Linghan has undergone multiple treatments.</p>
<p>The snow leopard is a Class A protected animal in China. There are 4,000 to 7,500 snow leopards in existence worldwide, according to field studies. Roughly 2,000 to 2,500 are in China.</p>
<p>The Xining Zoo has 12 snow leopards, including Aoxue, China&#8217;s first and only surviving, artificially bred snow leopard.</p>

China has adopted the vision that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets and pursued a holistic approach to conserving its mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, and grasslands. (Xinhua)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />China has increased its forest area and reversed its land degradation, contributing to the protection of the global ecosystem and environment, a report said Friday. </p>
<p>As the global forest coverage remained stable with a slight decline since the early 2000s, China has achieved remarkable results in afforestation and forest protection, a major contributor to maintaining the balance of global forest coverage, according to the Annual Report on Remote Sensing Monitoring of Global Ecosystem and Environment released by the National Remote Sensing Center. </p>
<p>China&#8217;s total forest area has increased by almost 45 million hectares in the past 20 years, said Gao Zhihai, one of the report&#8217;s authors. </p>
<p>Among the global arid and semi-arid regions, Asia has made the most progress in improving and restoring land from 2000 to 2018, accounting for more than 50 percent of the total, most notably in China and India, indicating that scientific policy guidance and actions can effectively reverse land degradation, the report said. </p>
<p>The report gave an example of earth observation technology with the potential to promote natural disaster emergency management. China has played an important role in remote sensing monitoring, disaster assessment and emergency response to disasters such as the devastating Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and an earthquake in central Indonesia. </p>
<p>This year has seen good momentum in the global production of staple grain and oil crops, said the report, noting that China&#8217;s soybean acreage has increased year on year since 2014.</p>

<p>Accounting for 15 percent of China&#8217;s land territory, the 2,750 natural reserves are home to hundreds of kinds of rare and endangered animals and plants.</p>
<p>China owned 2,750 natural reserves across the country at the end of September 2019, data from the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) showed.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s natural reserves cover a total area of 1.47 million square kilometers, accounting for 15 percent of the country&#8217;s land territory, according to a statement on the administration&#8217;s website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The reserves are home to 35 million hectares of natural forest and around 20 million hectares of natural wetland, protecting 90.5 percent of terrestrial ecosystem types, 85 percent of wild animal and plant types as well as 65 percent of higher plant communities.</p>
<p>More than 300 wild animals and 130 wild plants under the country&#8217;s key protection are preserved, enhancing the country&#8217;s biodiversity, the NFGA said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;China&#8217;s rare and endangered animals thrive in the reserves, with the number of wild crested ibis surging from seven to more than 2,000, that of gray snub-nosed monkey growing 1.5 times to more than 750 and the number of Asian elephants rising from 170 to more than 230.</p>
<p>China designated Dinghu Mountain, which lies in southern China&#8217;s Guangdong Province, as its first natural reserve in 1956 to protect forests.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">The polluted area in the Tengger Desert Photo: A screenshot of thepaper.cn</p>
<p>Authorities in Northwest China is investigating a local paper company that had discharged waste into the Tengger Desert, one of China&#8217;s largest deserts, and covered the case for 20 years due to unclear administrative jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The government of the Zhongwei city, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, announced on its website that, from October 21 to November 10, they had cleared 527,000 tons of black solid waste discharged by the Zhongwei Meili paper company.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Ministry of Ecology and Environment also sent an investigation team to Zhongwei city. Local police told the Global Times that the team arrived Saturday night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A local police officer involved in the case surnamed Qin told the Global Times on Monday that they have not yet finished clearing the desert.</p>
<p>Test results show that the level of pH, cyanide and heavy metals in the polluted area has not reached a dangerous standard, but it is still unclear if underground water has been affected, thepaper.cn reported, citing an environmental official.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luo Yameng, a Beijing-based environment protection and eco-city expert, told the Global Times on Monday that if sewage seeps into the ground, it will threaten people&#8217;s health, and it is almost impossible to recover once the waste water pollutes the underground water.</p>
<p>The pollutants were discharged by the Meilin company between 1998 and 2004. They were produced during the paper making process, thepaper.cn reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company built two waste water processing systems between 2002 and 2004 but continued to discharge waste into the desert until its pulping production line was closed in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the company is registered in Ningxia, the waste was discharged in the adjacent Alxa Left Banner in North China&#8217;s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is why the pollution remained undiscovered for nearly 20 years until some volunteers revealed it to the media recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhongwei authorities are in charge of the investigation and cooperating with Alxa Left Banner authorities, Qin said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the pollution had passed for many years, the company still deserves severe punishment as it committed an intentional crime, Luo said, noting that Ningxia authorities should also investigate to find out if any official helped the company cover up or neglect the pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luo called for a ban on establishing polluting companies in desertification areas and regions close to reserves, as the purification capacity of the desert is weak. </p>
<p>&#8220;In ecologically fragile regions, protecting the ecological environment should be given top priority. Once the ecological environment is destroyed, what is the use of economic development?&#8221; Luo added.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-top: 3px; color: #999">A man crosses a street in smoggy conditions in New Delhi, India on Monday. Millions of people in India&#8217;s capital started the week choking through &#8220;eye-burning&#8221; smog, with schools closed, cars taken off the road and construction halted. Photo: AFP</p>
<p>China&#8217;s remarkable achievements in reducing and managing air pollution could be educational for India, Chinese environmental scholars told the Global Times on Monday after the densely populated capital of the South Asian nation declared smog alerts this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If New Delhi could learn something from Beijing&#8217;s success, then given its smaller emissions, the city could solve its smog problems faster than Beijing, Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs,&nbsp;told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ma warned there was no one-size-fits-all policy. &#8220;It will be a long haul battle for Delhi,&#8221; Ma said.</p>
<p>An unprecedented public health emergency was declared over the weekend as pollution levels in the Delhi-National Capital Region region reached a three-year high. </p>
<p>As of Monday afternoon, the New Delhi Air Pollution real-time air quality index remained at a largely hazardous level with the reading exceeding 620 in some northern parts of the city. Schools in the Indian capital city were ordered closed and construction activities called off till Tuesday and more than 30 flights were reportedly diverted on Sunday, as pollution entered the &#8220;severe plus&#8221; or &#8220;emergency&#8221; category late Thursday night, the first time since January, New Delhi Television reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Delhi smog crisis served as a reminder for Beijing that efforts to combat air pollution must still continue, said Beijing environmentalist Ma, and it was too early to rest on any laurels.</p>
<p>A report released by Greenpeace and air pollution tracking app Airvisual indicated that average concentrations of pollutants fell in Chinese cities by 12 percent from 2017 to 2018, while the capital Beijing fell out of the top 100 most polluted cities worldwide following concerted efforts to get air pollution under control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ma noted China and India both suffered soaring emissions alongside accelerating urbanization with surging consumption of fossil fuels, especially coal, brought on by industrialization.</p>
<p>But India has yet to initiate sustainable, nationwide pollution action plans like Beijing and overall awareness in Indian society that could help monitor the implementation of such plans, has not been established, Ma noted.</p>
<p>What India might learn from the Chinese experience in particular was the introduction of real-time monitoring of companies&#8217; emissions and the replacement of dirty fuel with clean energy, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course the Indian capital city must also focus on adjusting its transport mix and infrastructure, he said.</p>
<p>In October, China issued a tougher plan to control air pollution in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding regions. Tianjin was told to shut down one 588-cubic-meter blast furnace.</p>
<p>New Delhi banned fossil-fueled cars on alter-nate days from Monday to November 15 according to their odd or even number license plates, a practice Beijing adopted before in response to extended bouts of choking acrid smog.</p>

<p>&nbsp;New research shows that sea levels are rising faster than expected, and by 2050, some of the greatest coastal cities, including Shanghai, will be wiped out. But some Chinese experts said the rise is not as fast, though they admitted global warming poses a huge challenge.</p>
<p>The Climate Central in New Jersey, the US published a new prediction on Tuesday, saying that through a more accurate way of calculating land elevation based on satellite readings, the center of East China&#8217;s Shanghai and other great coastal cities in the world such as such as Mumbai and Bangkok will be under water at high tide by mid-century.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, water threatens to consume the heart of the city and many other cities around it, according to a New York Times report.</p>
<p>A map in the research shows the old and new projections for 2050 for Shanghai. The city&#8217;s center becomes deep blue in the new projection, which means it will be below the high-tide line.</p>
<p>The research also said that a previous prediction was far too optimistic, and that southern Vietnam will disappear by 2050, where more than 20 million people, almost a fourth of the country&#8217;s population, currently live.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sea level is not rising that fast,&#8221; Zhang Zhiqiang, a deputy director of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, told the Global Times on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to China&#8217;s third national assessment of climate change published in 2015, China&#8217;s coastal sea levels rose at a rate of 2.9 millimeters per year from 1980 to 2012. The fourth assessment is under way.</p>
<p>Chinese experts also confirmed that rising sea levels would pose a huge threat to coastal cities if the global warming situation does not improve.</p>
<p>Bai Yunwen, policy director of Beijing-based nongovernmental organization Greenovation Hub, told the Global Times that regardless of how fast Shanghai or other coastal cities will be wiped out by rising sea levels, cities should be ready to deal with climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Urban planning should be improved to prevent floods,&#8221; Bai said. &#8220;The government also needs to consider how to ensure fresh water supply when the city sees rising sea levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bai noted that no country should ignore global warming and the disasters it causes. &#8220;All countries need to deal with global warming, especially with&nbsp;&nbsp; carbon emissions, such as the US.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has underlined the important role of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in building &#8220;Healthy China.&#8221; </p>
<p>The country should carry on fine elements in TCM and innovate them, Xi said in a recent instruction, stressing that traditional medicine is a treasure of Chinese civilization embodying the wisdom of the nation and its people. </p>
<p>Xi&#8217;s instruction was delivered at a national conference of TCM held Friday in Beijing. </p>
<p>Xi said that equal importance should be placed on traditional Chinese and Western medicines and efforts be made to enable them to supplement each other and prosper together. </p>
<p>He also underlined the efforts to promote TCM internationally and fully develop its unique strength in preventing and treating diseases. </p>
<p>In an instruction also delivered at the conference, Premier Li Keqiang called TCM a great creation of the Chinese nation. </p>
<p>Li stressed promoting talent training, scientific and technological innovation, and research and development of medicines. </p>
<p>He required efforts to promote preservation, innovation and high-quality development of TCM so that it will contribute to the improvement of people&#8217;s health and wellbeing. </p>
<p>Addressing the event, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan pledged to thoroughly implement the leaders&#8217; instructions. </p>
<p>People who made outstanding contribution to TCM development were awarded at the conference.</p>

<p>Chinese authorities published a comprehensive plan to control air pollution in Beijing, Tianjin, North China&#8217;s Hebei Province as well as surrounding areas which could experience heavy air pollution in autumn and winter.</p>
<p>The plan issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said the average PM 2.5 concentration in the regions in autumn and winter should be reduced by 4 percent year-on-year, and the number of days with heavy pollution or above should drop by 6 percent.</p>
<p>The report said that although China&#8217;s air quality has continued to improve, air pollution is still serious in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and surrounding areas in autumn and winter.</p>
<p>According to the report, the average concentration of PM 2.5 in the region increased by 6.5 percent year-on-year, and the number of heavily polluted days increased by 36.8 percent in autumn and winter from 2018 to 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan called on Tianjin to shut down one 588-cubic-meter blast furnace of the Rockcheck Group, Hebei Province to reduce its steel production by 14 million tons, and North China&#8217;s Shanxi Province and East China&#8217;s Shandong Province to cut their excessive industrial capacities.</p>
<p>All the cities in this region must replace 5.42 million tons of loose coal into gas and electricity to promote clean heating. Among them, 363,000 households are affected in Tianjin, 2.03 million in Hebei, 397,000 in Shanxi, 1.14 million in Shandong, and 1.31 million in Central China&#8217;s Henan Province.</p>
<p>The plan also called for an investigation of excessive discharges of motor vehicles, reducing road dust, supervising open burning and strengthening the construction of the automatic monitoring system for pollution sources.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has been suffering from severe air pollution due to poor natural conditions, low vegetation coverage, dense population and industry, and the burning of coal,&#8221; Zhang Yuanxun, an environmental science expert at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the government eliminates polluting enterprises in a short period of time, it may result in a loss of income sources in poverty-stricken areas within the region,&#8221; said Zhang.
