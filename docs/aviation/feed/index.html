<p>China&#8217;s newly-opened mega airport was the most punctual medium-sized airport in the world in October, its first month of operation, according to a report released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a boost for the state-of-the-art airport&#8217;s new profile, the Beijing Daxing International Airport (BDIA) recorded an impressive on-time departure rate of 94.51 percent, the highest of any airport, the report released by Chinese civil aviation data provider VariFlight showed.</p>
<p>Th average delay time for departure from the BDIA was at 9.46 minutes.</p>
<p>The BDIA handled 2,138 departures in October, which has been categorized as a medium-sized airport, according to VariFlight.</p>
<p>Located in the south of downtown Beijing, the BDIA is designed to handle 3.5 million passengers in 2019 and 72 million passengers by 2025.</p>

<p>The newly-opened Beijing Daxing International Airport (BDIA) received a flight from Finnair Monday morning, showing that the Finland-based carrier is operating in the form of &#8220;dual hubs&#8221; in Beijing &#8211; going through the two major airports of the Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) and BDIA.</p>
<p>Finnair has added three weekly frequencies to BDIA during the winter season of 2019 to 2020. In total, Finnair flies 10 weekly frequencies now.</p>
<p>With the added capacity, Finnair said it&nbsp;&nbsp;is &#8220;proud to satisfy more travel demand&#8221; between Beijing and over 100 destinations in Europe, allowing travelers short flight times and convenient transfers via Helsinki.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flying through the two airports of Beijing can help expand the carrier&#8217;s services to more regions in China, Mikko Turtiainen, vice president of global sales at Finnair, said during an interview on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daxing airport was officially put into operation on September 25, 2019. Thus far, it is the largest integrated transport hub in the world, with an area of 1.43 million square meters. Annual passenger traffic is estimated to reach 72 million by 2025, and international flights will account for 30 percent of total air traffic then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased to welcome more foreign carriers to operate here,&#8221; Kong Yue, vice president of BDIA, said on Monday.</p>
<p>Finnair has a strong commitment to and long history operating in China for a span of more than 30 years, and was the first foreign airline to announce operations at BDIA. Now, Finnair&#8217;s non-stop routes to China include those flying to Beijing, Shanghai, Xi&#8217;an, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Hong Kong, with Alipay mobile payment and Wi-Fi services provided onboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this winter season, 15 carriers are operating at BDIA. In addition to Finnair, 7 other overseas carriers will fly to BDIA , including British Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines, Royal Moroccan Airlines, Effie Airways and Himalayan Airlines.</p>
<p>Like Finnair, Polish Airlines will serve both airports in Beijing, according to BDIA.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Delta Air Lines celebrate successful move to Shanghai Pudong International Airport on October 25 Photo: Courtesy of Delta Air Lines </p>
<p>US-based Delta Air Lines has become one of the first overseas carriers to begin operations at China&#8217;s Pudong International Airport&#8217;s new satellite terminal.</p>
<p>The carrier, which is now the largest in the world in terms of revenue, held a ceremony on October 25 to mark its official relocation to S1. The move was made in a bid to improve on-time performance and ensure seamless transfers, as passengers can board all flights from the terminal directly instead of taking shuttle buses.</p>
<p>About 20 percent of Delta&#8217;s overseas passengers make transfers at Pudong, continuing on to domestic and international flights, Wong Hong, Delta&#8217;s China and Singapore president, said. &#8220;With our strategic partnership with China Eastern Airlines, we hope we can have more passengers for connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Delta currently operates four daily direct flights from Shanghai Pudong to major hub airports in the US, including those in Detroit, Seattle, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Through strategic cooperation with China Eastern Airlines, it provides passengers with more than 1,350 domestic codeshare flights per week, covering more than 40 cities in China.</p>
<p>Delta operates two direct flights to the US from Beijing every day, flying to Seattle and Detroit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To serve Chinese customers more efficiently, it is expected that in early December of this year, the direct flight route from Shanghai Pudong to Atlanta in the US will utilize the newly modified B777 aircrafts. At that time, all Delta flights from Shanghai to the US will be operated by its flagship A350 aircraft, the new A330-900neo aircraft or the retrofitted B777 passenger aircraft. All models are equipped with the next-generation Delta One Suite and Delta Premium Select seats.</p>
<p>The Beijing Daxing International Airport began operations last month. By winter, 15 carriers will be operating in the new airport, with eight from overseas including British Airways and Malaysia Airlines. Polish Airlines and Finnair will operate in both airports in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked if Delta would move to the new airport, Wong said they have not made any final decision as yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the long-term plan, we will definitely be with China Eastern Airlines. But for us, passenger transfer is also very important. If we move to the new airport, we must also consider the passenger&#8217;s transit demands,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Delta flights from the US arrive in Beijing, some passengers need to transfer to codeshare flights with China Eastern Airlines and Shanghai Airlines to other cities in China, he explained. The Daxing airport is relatively far from the Beijing Capital International Airport, so transit needs must be considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delta&#8217;s adjusted operating revenue of $12.6 billion for the September quarter improved 6.5 percent, $771 million higher than the same quarter of last year. This result marks a quarterly record for the company, driven by improvements across all Delta&#8217;s business lines, according to its fiscal report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company, however, said its Pacific revenues declined 4.6 percent during the quarter, with a 3.3 percent higher capacity and a 7.6 percent decline in unit revenues. Unit revenue performance was pressured by weaker macroeconomics, trade uncertainty and a nearly one point currency headwind.</p>
<p>Wong said that the growth rate of Delta&#8217;s flights in China this year is not as high as it was before. In the past, there had been a growth of around 15 percent every year, but this year&#8217;s growth is not as high partially due to the weak market demand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />In a bid to enhance connectivity between the two neighbors, a Nepal-China joint venture company Himalaya Airlines started the operation of direct flights from Kathmandu to the Chinese capital city Beijing from Sunday. </p>
<p>Organizing a special function at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, the company launched its maiden flight amid the presence of Nepali Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Yogesh Bhattarai and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi among others. </p>
<p>The flight marks the first-ever capital-to-capital direct connectivity between Nepal and China, giving great significance to the bilateral exchanges and cooperation of the two countries. </p>
<p>Addressing the ceremony, minister Bhattarai expressed hope that the connectivity between Beijing and Kathmandu can attract more Chinese tourists to visit Nepal. </p>
<p>&#8220;Direct flight between Beijing and Kathmandu has added a new avenue in Sino-Nepal relations. We hope more Chinese tourists would visit Nepal,&#8221; minister said. </p>
<p>Stating that the new connectivity has brought the people of two countries together, the minister shared that he is expecting half a million Chinese tourists to visit Nepal during Visit Nepal Year 2020. </p>
<p>Echoing his statement, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal said that the latest development has taken the aviation cooperation between the two countries to a new height. </p>
<p>Mentioning that China is the second largest tourism source market for Nepal, she said that Nepal has been the most preferred destination in South Asia for the Chinese tourists. </p>
<p>According to Himalaya Airlines, the new route is expected to ship over 40,000 Chinese passengers a year to Nepal for tourism and business cooperation. The airlines will operate three flights a week from Kathmandu&#8217;s Tribhuvan International Airport to Daxing International Airport in Beijing. </p>
<p>&#8220;The opening of this route will further facilitate the commuting of individual passengers and provide more efficient and convenient trade options for government officials, corporate personnel and businessmen of the two countries, &#8221; the company president Zhou Enyoung said. </p>
<p>The airlines said that they will soon be launching direct air service to other Chinese cities including Changsha and Shenzhen in the future. </p>
<p>Himalaya Airlines was established in August 2014. Having started with one aircraft and one destination, the airlines has progressively moved its way to three A320 and five international destinations in a span of three years. </span></p>

<p>China Eastern Airlines conducted the first international flight from Beijing&#8217;s new mega airport, the Beijing Daxing International Airport (BDIA), with a flight to Fukuoka, Japan on Sunday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As the new winter season approaches, the facility, which has only been open for one month, is welcoming more carriers to transfer flights.</p>
<p>China Eastern and China United Airlines will together operate 153 flights per day, accounting for 50 percent of the total at the new airport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those carriers will have the largest flight capacity in the new season.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will first transfer 10 percent of our capacity from Beijing Capital International Airport, including four international flights. Next year we will shift more flights here,&#8221; Liu Hao, vice general manager of the Beijing branch of China Eastern Airlines, told the Global Times on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The carrier plans to move 80 percent of its Beijing-based flights to Daxing by March 2021, making the hub the core of SkyTeam in Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another first for Daxing came on Sunday, as private carrier Juneyao Air left Shanghai headed for Beijing, the start of its services at the new airport. The carrier will fly three round trips a day between Beijing and Shanghai, with about 1,700 seats available.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">The KLM miniature houses on display at the 100th anniversary celebration held in Shanghai on October 19. </p>
<p>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is in the process of applying for a slot in Beijing&#8217;s new airport, and it hopes to operate from next summer, Pieter Elbers, president and CEO of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, said recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope we can fly in two airports in Beijing,&#8221; he said at the airline&#8217;s 100th anniversary celebration held in Shanghai on October 19.</p>
<p>The two airports in the capital are the Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) and the Beijing Daxing International Airport, which began operations at the end of September this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>KLM currently operates a daily flight to Amsterdam from BCIA.</p>
<p>KLM began its direct flight to Beijing in 1996 and to Shanghai in 1999, and has since expanded its reach to more second-tier cities such as Chengdu, Hangzhou and Xiamen. 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of its Shanghai-Amsterdam route.</p>
<p>KLM is not alone in seeking a slot at the new Daxing airport, as several more international carries will join domestic airlines operating there.</p>
<p>From Sunday, a number of domestic and foreign airlines will be transferred to, or enter, the new airport. The total number of airlines operating in Daxing will then reach 15, including eight from overseas countries, such as British Airways, Malaysia Airlines and Royal Brunei Airlines.</p>
<p>Two additional foreign airlines, Polish Airlines and Finnair, will operate simultaneously at Beijing&#8217;s two airports, and KLM hopes to follow.</p>
<p>Throughout the winter season this year, the new airport is expected to open 119 routes, including 104 domestic routes and covering 118 destinations worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p></strong>KLM&#8217;s potential expansion marks a development in the China-Europe aviation market, as Europe is one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travelers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data from the China Tourism Academy showed that in 2018, more than 6 million Chinese people traveled to Europe, making it the second-largest destination for Chinese tourists, second only to Asia. The China-Europe route market has maintained rapid growth.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, the average number of monthly flights between China and Europe has increased from 1,300 to 2,600, and the number of routes has increased from 30 to 76, data from global consultancy firm Roland Berger showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, there were 9 Chinese and 21 foreign airlines operating direct flights to Europe from China, Ma Congxian, vice president of Air China, said in May last year, according to a report from news portal jiemian.com.</p>
<p>Juneyao Airlines in June made its first flight from Shanghai to Helsinki in Finland, and became the first private Chinese airline to operate long-haul, wide-body aircraft.</p>
<p>However, the issue of excess capacity in the second-tier-city intercontinental market has always existed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, European demand for flights to second-tier Chinese cities was not very high. But in the last two years, European passengers traveling to Chengdu, Hangzhou and Xiamen are rising steadily in number, Elbers said, adding that KLM passengers can transfer from Xiamen, Chengdu and other airports to more Chinese destinations, in cooperation with Chinese airlines.</p>
<p>&#8220;China has become one of KLM&#8217;s most important markets, and is the second-largest overseas market after the US, and the largest market in Asia,&#8221; Elbers said.</p>
<p>When asked if KLM had any plan to open routes to new destinations in China, he replied that the airline&#8217;s current job is focusing on its present network.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Code sharing</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p></strong>In 1996, KLM launched its code-sharing cooperation with China Southern Airlines, a member of the SkyTeam Alliance, on the route from Amsterdam to Beijing. It later expanded this to more routes.</p>
<p>However, China Southern left the SkyTeam Alliance in late 2018.</p>
<p>When asked if its departure from the alliance would hurt the cooperation between the two carriers, Elbers said that they would maintain their code-sharing relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, China Southern Airlines has a daily direct flight to Amsterdam from Beijing and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>KLM has carried out code sharing cooperation with Xiamen Airlines from 2012. In July 2015, with the support of KLM, Xiamen Airlines opened its Xiamen-Amsterdam route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On October 16, China Eastern announced its intention to enter into a joint venture with Virgin Atlantic, Air France and KLM, providing more valuable and attractive joint commercial propositions for customers traveling between Europe and China.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strengthened cooperation will offer increased customer benefits including more travel options and optimized connectivity across Europe and China, further facilitated by a developed joint network, as well as competitive joint commercial propositions, according to a note China Eastern sent to the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insiders said that at present, competition in the aviation market between China and Europe has gradually begun to emerge from its early chaos, and that a group-based competition trend based on aviation alliances and airline business cooperation has slowly formed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />The representative office of China Southern Airlines on Monday presented its international air routes in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. </p>
<p>&#8220;In recent years, China Southern Airlines has set a task to connect the world and create a better life and accelerated the construction of a world-class air transport company,&#8221; said Zhong Bin, deputy head of the marketing department of the airlines&#8217; branch in northwest China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/special-coverage/Xinjiang.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xinjiang</a> Uygur Autonomous Region. </p>
<p>In his keynote speech during the presentation, Zhong said that China Southern Airlines, as one of China&#8217;s three major air transport companies and the largest airline in Asia, is an active participant in the implementation of the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative. </p>
<p>The company has opened 172 routes in 68 cities of 38 countries located along the Belt and Road route and carries more than 15 million passengers annually, according to Zhong. </p>
<p>Besides, he said that the company has expanded strategic and business relations with international partners such as American Airlines, Emirates Airlines and Finnair. </p>
<p>In recent years, bilateral trade between China and Kyrgyzstan has reached a new level, and China&#8217;s investment in Kyrgyzstan has also made a new breakthrough, according to Li Yue, adviser on trade and economic issues of the Chinese Embassy in the Kyrgyz Republic. </p>
<p>&#8220;The aviation industry serves as an engine for the development of relations between the two countries, providing strong guarantees and support for Chinese-Kyrgyz relations and trade and economic cooperation,&#8221; Li said. </p>
<p>He said that the company has been an important part of Chinese businesses in Kyrgyzstan since the Urumqi-Bishkek route was opened in 1998, and has since then developed multiple routes. </p>
<p>For his part, Director of the Civil Aviation Agency of Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Akyshev praised China Southern Airlines as one of the best airlines in Kyrgyzstan. </p>
<p>He said that the company has been promoting close cooperation between Chinese and Kyrgyz personnel for many years with its professional and high-quality service.</p>

<p align="left">China&#8217;s offshore wind energy has big potential to be developed, which has provided much room for growth in the domestic helicopter business, a senior executive from Airbus Helicopters said on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has roughly a 20 percent share of global offshore wind energy. It is predicted that China&#8217;s offshore wind generating capacity in 2030 will reach 100 GW, compared with 250 GW globally, Dennis Bernitz, head of Western Europe sales for Airbus Helicopters, said in a news briefing held in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has the highest wind utilization potential if calculated by its number of working turbines, and using helicopters can increase the energy revenues of wind farms in China by 2.5 to 10 percent, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<div align="left">
 The Airbus helicopter has its advantages in efficiency, and it can ensure safe operations and provide medical evacuation 24 hours a day if needed, Bernitz said.</p>
<p>After decades of development, China&#8217;s helicopter industry has become the fastest-growing segment of the aviation industry, and it has developed greatly in fields including flight training, air tours, medical rescue and emergency rescue.</p>
<p>At a recently concluded helicopter exhibition held in Tianjin, there were 415 exhibiting companies from 18 countries and regions around the world showcasing 53 types of helicopters.</p>
<p>Tan Ruisong, chairman of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), said the Chinese helicopter industry has achieved a leap forward after years of development, according to a report from www.ce.cn on October 15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said that at present, the industry has built a complete independent producing procedure covering R&amp;D, and delivery and service, and has delivered more than 1,000 helicopters at home and abroad, making China one of the world&#8217;s largest helicopter manufacturing bases.</p>
<p>Airbus has become the largest partner in the Chinese helicopter industry after more than 50 years of development, since it entered China in 1967. At present, the market share of Chinese civilian-use helicopters has accounted for 37 percent of the total, with more than 300 Airbus helicopters serving 87 Chinese companies, data from Airbus showed.

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">Z-20 File photo: IC</p>
<p>Hovering over the air show area, a fleet of China&#8217;s new self-developed Z-20 helicopters took part in a flight demonstration at a helicopter expo in northern China&#8217;s Tianjin Municipality.</p>
<p>The multifunctional helicopter, developed by the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), made its first public appearance during a massive National Day parade on October 1.</p>
<p>Li Linhua, chief technologist with the helicopter division of the AVIC, said the Z-20 is a medium-lift helicopter with double, China-made engines. It can work in complicated meteorological conditions and has good adaptability to high elevations.</p>
<p>Chen Guang, vice general manager of AVIC Helicopter Co, the AVIC helicopter branch in charge of the Z-20 project, said the adoption of the fly-by-wire flight control system can substantially reduce the Z-20&#8217;s overall weight.</p>
<p>&#8220;The innovation of the Z-20 helicopter will play a leading role in China&#8217;s helicopter industry development in the future,&#8221; Chen said.</p>
<p>Helicopters have become one of the fastest-growing segments of China&#8217;s aviation industry, with an average growth rate of 25 percent over the past five years.</p>
<p>The helicopter family has developed systematically with various models, witnessing the continuous improvement of innovation capabilities. They can be used in public services, emergency rescue, flight training, air tours and traditional agricultural work.</p>
<p>As the leading company of China&#8217;s helicopter industry, AVIC Helicopter adheres to the development path of independent innovation and has developed various piloted and unmanned helicopters.</p>
<p>Lv Jie, general manager of AVIC Helicopter, said the series of AC311, AC312 and AC313 civilian helicopters developed by the company have received type certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and have been put into use in the fields of forest fire prevention, police aviation, search and rescue, and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among them, the AC313 has become core equipment for forest fire protection, and the AC312 and AC311 helicopters have been used for police aviation in nine provinces and municipalities of China,&#8221; Lv said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the &#8220;heart&#8221; engine for the helicopter has also seen a breakthrough. The WZ16 aircraft engine, a type of turboshaft engine jointly developed by the Aero Engine Corporation of China and French aviation giant Safran, has received a certificate from the CAAC.</p>
<p>The engine has a takeoff power of no less than 1,240 kilowatts. It can be fitted into seven-ton twin-engine helicopters. It is characterized by high reliability and has reached the level of advanced international civilian engines.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aviation industry is an important support for China&#8217;s strategy of building strong manufacturing power,&#8221; said Wu Xiandong, executive vice president of the AVIC, adding that many innovative breakthroughs in the aviation industry have provided driving forces for the growth of the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The 5th China Helicopter Exposition concluded on October 13 in Tianjin, with sales of 141 helicopters surpassing 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion), according to the organizers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 3px">A Southwest Airlines 737NG is landing at McCarran Airport with mountains in background. File photo: IC</p>
<p>The Indonesian Transportation Ministry grounded three Boeing 737NG (Next Generation) planes operated by two airlines following findings of cracks in the aircraft, an official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The three grounded planes included one operated by the state-run airline Garuda Indonesia and two operated by the private airline Sriwijaya Air, according to Avirianto, the Airworthiness and Plane Operation Director at the Ministry.</p>
<p>The grounding of those planes will continue until further recommendations are issued by Boeing, he said.</p>
<p>Furthermore we advise all national airlines operating the Boeing 737NG, including Garuda Indonesia, Lion Air, Batik Air and Sriwijaya Air, to periodically conduct maintenance programs every 3,500 flight cycles in accordance with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) mechanism, he said.</p>
<p>Cracks were found in planes which already had a Flight Cycle Number (FCN) of 30,000, he said.</p>
<p>The cracks were found in one of three Boeing 737NGs operated by Garuda Indonesia, and in two of five of the same aircraft operated by Sriwijaya Air.</p>
<p>The grounding order was issued after inspections were carried out by the Ministry in line with airworthiness directives from international aviation agencies, which called for checks of Boeing 737NG planes operated by all airlines globally.</p>
<p><strong>Southwest, Gol ground 13 737NGs</strong></p>
<p>On October 9, the US&#8217; Southwest Airlines Co and Brazil&#8217;s Gol Linhas Aereas grounded a total of 13 Boeing 737NG airplanes, the companies said, after US regulators ordered urgent inspections.</p>
<p>Southwest said it had taken two planes out of service, while Gol had grounded 11. Both airlines are major operators of the 737, including the NG variant and the more recent MAX, which has been grounded for months after two deadly crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration earlier told aircraft operators to inspect 165 older 737NG planes for structural cracks within seven days, after cracking was found on a small number of planes. Nearly all the 165 jets were Southwest aircraft, officials said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First delivered in 1997, the NG is the third generation of the 737, preceding the grounded MAX, which is unaffected by the cracking issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Southwest, which did not find any issues in the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of planes, said it &#8220;removed the two aircraft from [its] operation and reported the findings to Boeing and the FAA.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gol, which runs a fleet of 115 737s excluding its grounded MAX jets, said it took 11 out of service after finding &#8220;evidence of the need to replace a specific component.&#8221; The fleet change will affect 3 percent of passengers until December 15, it said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inspections were ordered following the discovery of cracks on a part known as the &#8220;pickle fork,&#8221; which attaches the fuselage to the wing structure and manages forces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minor aircraft cracks are not unusual, an industry source said, but are not normally expected to occur on the pickle fork until near the end of the plane&#8217;s lifespan, typically considered to be more than 90,000 FCN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FAA mandated checks for &#8220;cracking of the left and right hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps,&#8221; warning that the issue &#8220;could adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane&#8221; and result in loss of control. More planes will eventually be inspected, it said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial inspection order covered a total of 1,911 US-registered planes. The checks can be done visually and take about an hour per airplane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aircraft that have carried out more than 30,000 FCN, must be checked within seven days, the safety regulator said, while those with 22,600 to 29,999 FCN must be checked before completing a further 1,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boeing has been in touch with 737NG operators about the inspections, the manufacturer said earlier, emphasizing that &#8220;no in-service issues have been reported.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>United Airlines and American Airlines Inc are among other US carriers flying the 737NG, which includes the 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER variants.</p>
<p>Each airline has about 80 planes that will need inspections in coming months, United and American said, but none that fall into the seven-day requirement for more urgent checks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>United and American said they have not seen any cracks on their airplanes.</p>
<p>European budget carrier Ryanair, which has a fleet of more than 450 737-800s, confirmed it was in the process of carrying out the inspections, without saying how many planes required them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are midway through the first part of this mandatory check program and don&#8217;t expect it will have any impact upon our fleet or operations,&#8221; a Ryanair spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transavia Airlines, a low-cost carrier owned by Air France-KLM, said it would examine all 42 of its 737s even though only 16 need checks under the FAA mandate &#8211; of which one was inspected under the seven-day requirement. KLM, which also operates 737NGs, has inspected all but one of 13 aircraft covered by the order and found no anomalies, a spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeju Air, a South Korean low-cost operator, had also completed the majority of required checks, while inspections were ongoing at domestic rival Jin Air and had been completed at Eastar Jet. None of the three airlines had found any issues, they said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana"><strong>Cracks found on 38 jets</strong></span></p>
<p></strong>Boeing said on October 10 that airlines had inspected 810 of the company&#8217;s 737NG jets around the world and found 38 structural cracks requiring repair and replacement of the affected parts.</p>
<p>The planes will be grounded until the repairs are made, Boeing and airline officials said. Nearly 5 percent of inspections have found cracks in the pickle fork.</p>
<p>The FAA had earlier told US aircraft operators to inspect 165 older 737 NGs for structural cracks, but it now appears the actual number of planes covered is more than 200.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FAA said late on October 10 that &#8220;a small number of aircraft based in the US have been removed from service while Boeing develops instructions for customers to repair or replace the affected parts.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agency added it &#8220;is working with the manufacturer and other international aviation safety regulators to better understand the factors that led to the formation of the cracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Southwest spokesperson Brandy King said that out of more than 200 high-use airplanes, it had found cracks on two planes and grounded them. She declined to say if cracks had been found on any other jets but said the airline planned to release an update next week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not have a timeline for when the airplanes will be returned to service; we are working with Boeing to schedule the upcoming repairs,&#8221; King said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in a research note on Thursday that the findings from the 737NG inspections could &#8220;potentially take up to 4 percent of capacity off-line between mid-October and mid-December.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Planes with cracks &#8220;may need to be taken out of the fleet for up to 60 days for maintenance,&#8221; Syth said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FAA last week said inspections would look for &#8220;cracking of the left and right hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
