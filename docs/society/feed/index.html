<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />China&#8217;s mega water diversion project has transferred nearly 30 billion cubic meters of water in the past five years, official data showed Thursday.</p>
<p>The first phase of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project has directly benefited over 120 million people since it went into operation on Dec. 12, 2014, according to the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/19.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Water Resources</a>.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s per capita water resources is only 28 percent of the world&#8217;s average and China&#8217;s water resources are unevenly distributed across the country. Water is abundant in the south while scarce in the north, making the water diversion project a necessary move.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Ge Fengjin, son of Ge Daorong, a survivor of the <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1080223.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanjing Massacre</a>, held a testimony meeting here on Wednesday night to convey the truth about the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 and remind people to never forget history. Photo: Xinhua</p>
<p>Ge Fengjin, son of Ge Daorong, a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, held a testimony meeting here on Wednesday night to convey the truth about the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 and remind people to never forget history.</p>
<p>At the invitation of a few local civil groups, Ge Fengjin shared his father&#8217;s story at the meeting to mark the 82nd anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre. About 100 people attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Ge Daorong, a survivor of the massacre, was only 10 years old when Nanjing fell to Japanese invaders. He survived by escaping into the Safety Zone during the mass killing, but his three uncles did not.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, he has devoted himself to sharing his story. As he gets older, his son has taken over.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Dec. 13, 1937, the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing and carried out the deadly Nanjing massacre, killing 300,000 of our compatriots, including my family members,&#8221; said Ge Fengjin.</p>
<p>As descendant of a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre, he said he should not only remember the painful history, but also has the responsibility to tell the truth and testify to the the mass-killing, adding that he wants more young people to know and remember this part of history.</p>
<p>Sun Zhaiwei, an expert on the Nanjing Massacre and researcher at Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, delivered a speech themed &#8220;The solemn truth of Nanjing Defense Battle&#8221; at the meeting.</p>
<p>He introduced the historical background of the Nanjing Massacre, the historical truth of the Nanjing Defense Battle, from three aspects: &#8220;the capture of Nanjing is the established goal of the Japanese army,&#8221; &#8220;the heroic fight of Chinese soldiers&#8221; and &#8220;the important historical position of the battle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reviewing the truth of the battle is not to continue the hatred, Sun said, but to learn from the historical experience, be vigilant to the resurgence of Japanese militarism which has brought disasters to mankind, and work together to strive for and maintain lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Shota Naito, a postdoctoral fellow majored in history from Japan&#8217;s Meiji University, told Xinhua that he has been attending the testimony meeting of the Nanjing Massacre in Tokyo every year since 2015.</p>
<p>Each year, the organizers invite various people to talk about the massacre in different places and perspectives, which offers a rare opportunity to learn about the truth of history in Japan, he said, adding that he is concerned that some people in Japan do not know the truth of history, and some even attempt to falsify history, forget history and deny the existence of the Nanjing Massacre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time I listen to the stories with tears in my eyes, I feel sorry (for the Chinese people),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Massacre took place after the Japanese troops captured the city on Dec. 13, 1937. Over six weeks, they killed about 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers in one of the most barbaric episodes of World War II.&nbsp;</p>

(Xinhua/Zhao Ge)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
<br />Leaders of some Chinese American groups have expressed firm opposition to and issued a strong condemnation of the Xinjiang-related bill passed by the US House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The passage of the so-called &#8220;Uygur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019&#8221; earlier this month is a gross interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs, and lays bare the double standards the United States is playing with on counterterrorism and human rights issues, said Liang Guanjun, president of the United Chinese Association of Eastern US Inc., at a gathering of over 100 Chinese Americans on Tuesday in Flushing, New York.</p>
<p>The political move will encourage the spread of terrorism in Xinjiang and have a negative impact on the development of US-China relations, Liang said.</p>
<p>Ma Yue, president of New York Association for the Peaceful Unification of China, said that Americans, especially New Yorkers, understand the pain inflicted by terrorism.</p>
<p>However, by passing the Xinjiang-related bill, the US House turned a blind eye to China&#8217;s efforts to eradicate terrorism, and the move will hinder the development of counterterrorism operations worldwide, Ma said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why conducting certain crimes are defined as terrorism in the United States, while doing the same things in China are somehow defined as a movement defending human rights? This is purely playing with double standards,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-top: 3px; color: #999">Photo: Screenshot of Weibo</p>
<p>A café chain in Southwest China&#8217;s Chongqing municipality said it had returned red pandas, China&#8217;s second-class protected animal, to a local breeding facility after a social media post showing the animals in their shop triggered a flood of criticism online and caused the national forestry authority to launch an investigation.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Forestry and Grassland Administration said on Sina Weibo on Wednesday that trading in wild animals is prohibited and vowed further investigation into the case.</p>
<p>A netizen posted a photo on Sina Weibo on Monday that showed a red panda in a café in Chongqing and questioned if the café was allowed to have the animal. The photo featured the red panda lying on the floor in the café.</p>
<p>The post triggered a social media backlash with many netizens calling on the related authorities to investigate the case and protect the animals.</p>
<p>A café employee surnamed Zhu told the Global Times that they had stopped the activity and sent the pandas back to a local breeding facility after the criticism.</p>
<p>Zhu said that they did not buy the pandas and were not planning to raise the animals.</p>
<p>The café was cooperating with the breeding facility to hold science education activities in the shop and that&#8217;s why the red pandas were taken to the café to see if they could adapt to living there, said Zhu.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the red pandas could adapt to the café&#8217;s environment, there would be activities here where children could learn more about the animals and their habits by observing the pandas and the animals would be returned after the activities,&#8221; Zhu said.</p>
<p>According to the related law and regulation, an individual or group without a license to domesticate and breed wild animals will be fined up to 3,000 yuan ($426) and have the animals confiscated.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-top: 3px; color: #999">Illustration: Liu Rui/GT</p>
<p>The Communist Party of China&#8217;s (CPC) disciplinary watchdog has taken aim at a so-called academic paper analyzing biological causes for corrupt activities and suggested that the best way to prevent graft is to set up a mechanism under which no one dare, or is willing, to engage in corruption.</p>
<p>A research paper claiming that excessive activity and disorder of the gut flora DNA system may be a biological cause of humans&#8217; corrupt activities, and that by controlling gut flora, it would help physiologically eliminate hunger and reduce people&#8217;s material needs and desires, making them more diligent and self-disciplined.</p>
<p>The paper, which has been widely circulated online, has aroused heated discussion about its authenticity.</p>
<p>While some see it as a joke, the Central Commission of Discipline Inspection (CCDI) of the CPC, the anti-graft authority, is taking it seriously by publishing an article on its official WeChat account, saying that rather than targeting gut flora in anti-corruption efforts, it needs more reliable measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Corruption is a common problem in human society, and the causes of corruption are very complex. From case reporting to inspection to supervision and investigation, corruption is the result of a variety of factors,&#8221; the CCDI said in a post.</p>
<p>Various factors for conducting corrupt activities include that current punishment is not enough of a deterrent, the system is not perfect and the supervision is weak, or people have selfish desires, as well as political and social environments in addition to historical factors, it noted.</p>
<p>In this case, establishing a comprehensive mechanism to deter potential corruption is very necessary, as the Party has zero tolerance for corrupt acts.</p>

<p>Netizens hailed Peking University for sacking Professor Feng Renjie on Wednesday for violating teachers&#8217; ethics and discipline over an alleged sex scandal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The university revoked Feng&#8217;s qualifications as a teacher and disqualified him from relevant talent schemes.</p>
<p>Frequent sexual assault scandals among college teachers have prompted Chinese netizens to call for a mechanism to prevent sexual harassment in colleges and universities.</p>
<p>A sound investigation system is required to protect the informant and accused, experts said.</p>
<p>Peking University launched an investigation on December 2 into a report that Feng has maintained sexual relations with multiple women at the same time, including a brief marriage to a college student.</p>
<p>The university&#8217;s decision comes on the heels of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics&#8217; decision to dismiss an associate professor on Monday for allegedly sexually assaulting a student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar case happened on October 14 when Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University dismissed a teacher who was detained on criminal charges for allegedly raping a female student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netizens compiled a list of professors suspected of sexual harassment or scandals at universities across China on Sina Weibo, and encouraged more victims to expose scandals.</p>
<p>Unlike sexual harassment in public spaces, sexual harassment on university campuses is often more insidious, Zhu Wei, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students in a naturally disadvantaged position sometimes find it hard to resist &#8216;excessive care&#8217; shown by their teachers. It is also more difficult for them to obtain evidence and defend their rights after being violated, especially when the teacher has a final say on their test scores,&#8221; said a student, who had been sexually harassed but declined to tell her name.</p>
<p>Zhu emphasized the importance of an investigation mechanism on campus which can respond quickly to victims. But it is also necessary to prevent the abuse of a whistleblower if the complaint involves a false accusation.</p>

<p>Zisiqiao is nicknamed as China&#8217;s &#8220;No.1 Snake Village&#8221; with celebrity resident Yang Hongchang dubbed China&#8217;s &#8220;snake king.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Slither of hope</p>
<p></strong>This story dates back to the 1970s when the then 18-year-old Yang ­Hongchang contracted a spinal mobility disease that cost all his family&#8217;s limited wealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The disease broke his body and medical treatment Yang sought had failed to control his ailing condition. A traditional Chinese medicine doctor in Shanghai suggested that Yang try snake liquor as there were snakes in the mountainous area of Deqing where Zisiqiao is located.</p>
<p>Yang caught snakes to make snake liquor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazingly, the spinal infection was finally under control without worsening further,&#8221; Yang told the Global Times. &#8220;Inspired by my own experience, I think snakes can also help cure disease for other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He soon started selling snake liquor and snake pills to earn some money.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wild snakes couldn&#8217;t meet the ever increasing market demand when China began its reform and open-up. In traditional Chinese medicine, snakes are recognized for the medicinal properties and are commonly prepared in nutrition soup or drunk as liquor to boost people&#8217;s immune system. It occurred to me that I could domesticate snakes,&#8221; said Yang, who became the first snake farmer in the village.</p>
<p>Yang believed the medical attributes of venom, gall bladder, liver and skin from snakes would make him a fortune, but the road to the throne as the&#8221;snake king in China&#8221; was not a smooth path of slithering.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first year of 1982, just 10 percent of the snake eggs I purchased hatched, which caused a net loss of more than 10,000 yuan ($1,428).&#8221; Yang didn&#8217;t give up and was determined to keep doing what worked but learn from his mistakes.</p>
<p>Yang improved the incubators for the snake eggs and provided intricate care throughout the hatching period. The next year, the incubating rate reached 80 percent. Yang bred more than 30,000 snakes successfully and sold them to pharmaceutical companies for quite good prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine! That was in 1983. I earned more than 140,000 yuan by raising snakes,&#8221; Yang recalled, feeling as if he had struck gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusted for inflation, that 10,000 yuan is equal to one million today&#8217;s yuan. Inspired by Yang&#8217;s success in the 1980s, the whole village jumped into the snake-raising wave without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Pythons, vipers and cobras are everywhere in the tiny village, which breeds 3 million snakes a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Economies of snake&#8217;s scale</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Fan, an official with Xinshi town told the Global Times that 90 percent of the current 182 households in Zisiqiao breed snakes as their main income source. With 1.5 million snakes incubated annually, the village has yielded revenue of 30 million yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snake-related industries are also booming in the village. Yang innovated processing facilities,invested in new technology and expanded new markets to compete with rival snake farmers all over China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not easy to grab market share as competition was fierce since there were hundreds of snake villages in China about 20 years ago. Some farmers raised snake to provide meat to restaurants, the others targeted its medical function as we did. Luckily we focused on the medical side, which helped us become the real number one &#8216;snake village&#8217; after 2003 when the SARS broke out in China. Thereafter, people didn&#8217;t dare consume snake. Many snake farmers stopped raising snakes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Villagers like Yang Xiubang and Yang Hongnian have followed &#8220;king of snake&#8221; ever since. Xiubang, 54, told the Global Times that he can now earn more than 500,000 yuan a year. Back 25 years ago, he could only earn 30,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yang Hongnian, 70, and his wife have extracted about 30 bottles of snake venom this year. The 500-gram bottle venom can be sold at 8,500 yuan. The couple also sells dry snakes and other snake organs to pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;My snake products are exported to foreign countries. The skins go to France and Italy for luxury brand bags. The livers and gall bladders go to Japan and South Korea,&#8221; said Xiubang, adding that &#8220;I love snakes; they bring me fortune and change our life. Every part of a snake is treasure, from inside to outside, from head to tail.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bottleneck and prospects</p>
<p></strong>Villagers like Xiubang expressed pity that they can only provide raw materials which means they were still at the bottom end of the industrial chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xiubang&#8217;s concern was echoed by college-educated, younger generation snake farmers such as 32-year-old Yang Xiaoxia.</p>
<p>Xiaoxia and her husband chose the snake farming route after they graduated from Zhejiang Chinese Medical University. She first went to work as a technique supporter for a South Korean biomedical company, a joint venture between Yang Hongchang and his Korean partners. Xiaoxia holds many more will come to believe the medical value of snakes, from Asia to Europe, and even in the Americas.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more profitable to provide materials to foreign clients than the domestic ones. At the same time it&#8217;s much stricter to do export business as the quality criteria are very high. A large part of our products couldn&#8217;t meet the requirements. But we still would target exports more,&#8221; Xiaoxia told the Global Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xiaoxia and her husband hoped that they could move forward with turning their snake raw materials into more complex medicine, with more technology and academic support from research institutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zisiqiao government supported Yang Hongchang and recommended his company becoming a provincial technological, and agricultural enterprise in Zhejiang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has shifted business from simple raw material processing to health-oriented biomedical research and development. The products from his company have upgraded from the traditional snake oil cream, snake pills, snake liquor, snake liver, snake gall bladder to peptide concept medicine and cosmetics.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative, our traditional Chinese medicine will also go abroad, I hope that all Chinese snake farmers can make contribution to the health of human beings in the world,&#8221; he hoped.</p>

<p>The purpose behind the Xinjiang-related bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives is to impede China&#8217;s development by creating trouble, General Secretary of the Egyptian Communist Party Salah Adly has said.</p>
<p>The passage of the Xinjiang-related bill is &#8220;a blatant and aggressive approach&#8221; Washington has adopted against China, Adly told Xinhua in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The United States fabricates problems and stirs up trouble &#8220;in an attempt to hold back China,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>On Dec. 3, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the so-called &#8220;Uygur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019,&#8221; maliciously attacking the human rights conditions in Xinjiang and slandering China&#8217;s de-radicalization and anti-terrorism efforts.</p>

<p>China has expressed strong indignation over and firm opposition to the passing of the bill.</p>
<p>Adly also denounced the United States&#8217; repeated interference in China&#8217;s internal affairs, noting that the U.S. move violates &#8220;all international norms in an unprecedented way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He praised the Chinese leadership and government for dealing with the U.S. provocations &#8220;wisely and powerfully at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese leadership is keen to maintain global peace and stability,&#8221; he said, adding that &#8220;China is a country that highly respects international law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adly noted that China is always swift to clarify the facts by adopting an approach that exposes the U.S. practices and refutes them in front of the international community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
