<p>About 51.3 percent of China&#8217;s GDP would be digitalization-related by 2023 as the country&#8217;s enterprises step up digitalizing their businesses, global market intelligence firm IDC predicted.</p>
<p>The research firm estimated that by 2025, at least 80 percent of China&#8217;s new corporate applications would use artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
<p>Chief information officers would play bigger roles within companies by planning for innovative development, while there would be rising demand for professionals in ensuring digital security and compliance, IDC said.</p>

<p>China is on fast track for digitalization, while firms should take future-oriented strategies to prepare for related changes, said Kitty Fok, IDC China&#8217;s managing director.</p>
<p>Chinese firms&#8217; spending on digital transformation has expanded over a threshold by accounting for 51 percent of their total information technology (IT) expenditure this year, a previous report by IDC and Chinese IT firm Inspur showed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Americans for Free Trade, a coalition of more than 150 associations united against tariffs, on Wednesday urged U.S. President Donald Trump to reach a &#8220;phase one&#8221; deal with China.</p>
<p>&#8220;We urge you to reach a Phase One deal with China and take the necessary steps to resolve the ongoing trade dispute,&#8221; the coalition wrote in a letter to Trump and strongly encouraged the administration to suspend implementation of the so-called &#8220;Tranche 4B tariffs&#8221; on Chinese goods scheduled for Dec. 15 if a &#8220;phase one&#8221; deal is not finalized before then.</p>
<p>The Trump administration in August announced a plan to put 15 percent tariffs on billions of U.S. dollars in Chinese-made consumer goods on Dec. 15, known as the &#8220;4B&#8221; list of goods.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it is incredibly important for the ongoing negotiations to be allowed to continue without the specter of new tariffs taking effect before a deal is signed,&#8221; the letter said, adding that the U.S. administration has previously delayed those tariffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you noted when the Tranche 4B tariffs were announced, you delayed implementation of those tariffs specifically to avoid harming American consumers over the holidays. This delay should be extended until a deal is reached,&#8221; said the letter.</p>
<p>China is ready to work with the U.S. side to properly address each other&#8217;s core concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect and strive to reach a &#8220;phase one&#8221; deal, which serves the interests of both countries and the rest of the world, China&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/db/government/21.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Commerce</a> spokesperson Gao Feng said last month.</p>
<p>The letter came after anti-tariff campaign group Tariffs Hurt the Heartland said Monday that American consumers and businesses paid an additional 42 billion dollars from February 2018 through October 2019 as a result of Washington-initiated trade disputes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to believe that tariffs are the wrong approach, and we believe these tariffs are causing escalating economic harm to American businesses, workers, farmers and families across the country,&#8221; the coalition said.</p>
<p>Citing a research by Trade Partnership Worldwide, LLC, an international trade and economic consulting firm, the coalition said the U.S. Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods, along with the ongoing Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum and retaliation, have cost the average American family of four nearly 800 dollars this year and have shaved 0.4 percent off the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>If additional tariffs on all of the remaining Chinese imports are applied, &#8220;the negative impacts to American families will grow to over 2,300 dollars, and the hit to U.S. GDP will be a negative 1 percent,&#8221; the coalition warned.</p>

<p>Brazil&#8217;s retail sales, an engine of economic growth, rose 0.1 percent in October compared to the previous month, marking six months in a row of increases, the state statistics agency IBGE reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Compared to October of last year, retail sales grew 4.2 percent.</p>
<p>In the first 10 months of the year, the sector accumulated a 1.6-percent increase, while the figure for the 12 months to October is 1.8 percent.</p>
<p>It looks like retail sales will close the year on a higher note than when the year began in January, the IBGE said.</p>
<p>The agency traced the positive numbers &#8220;to a better outlook for consumption&#8221; thanks to &#8220;an improvement in the job market, despite the fact that informal labor predominates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six of eight consumer categories registered an increase in sales in October, led by office equipment and supplies, computers and communication devices.</p>
<p>Food and beverage, and tobacco products saw a slight decrease in sales of 0.1 percent, as did books, newspapers, magazines and stationery supplies, 1.1 percent.</p>
<p>This six-month trend points to a recovery of Brazil&#8217;s economy, which stagnated in the first quarter of 2019, but picked up by 0.5 percent in the second quarter and 0.6 percent in the third.</p>
<p>Brazil&#8217;s financial market has forecast 1.1-percent growth for the year, the same as in 2017 and 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo:Xinhua</p>
<p>Stakes are high as skittish global investors watch closely whether or not US President Donald Trump will decide to stop a fresh batch of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods planned for December 15 &#8211; a decision Chinese analysts say could impact ongoing trade talks for a phase one deal, as well as global financial markets and US consumers&#8217; wallets.</p>
<p>The US appears to be playing a game of brinksmanship by attempting to use the tariffs as leverage to pressure China in ongoing trade negotiations for a phase one trade agreement, further throwing global trade and financial markets into uncertainty, analysts noted. Such an intention will not work with China, which will likely keep firm on key issues, they said.</p>
<p>While there have been some signs that Trump might delay the new tariffs on $160 billion worth of Chinese products, including toys and electronics, the US has not made any official announcement yet, raising uncertainty over the delicate ongoing negotiations aimed at resolving the 18-month long bruising trade war and adding to the possibility of a new wave of tit-for-tat tariff battles.</p>
<p>In direct response to the US tariffs, China announced in late August that it would impose tariffs of 10 percent and 5 percent on more than 3,300 types of US goods, including auto parts and chemicals, starting on December 15. If the US goes ahead with its tariffs, China will also respond in kind, analysts said.</p>
<p>Chinese and US officials have been negotiating for a phase one trade agreement but have not reached one so far. US officials have reportedly offered to cancel the planned tariffs for a phase one trade deal, but Chinese officials insist that existing tariffs, not planned ones, must be removed for an agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US&#8217; lack of sincerity in moving along the trade talks have backed Trump into a corner, where he faces a tough decision, analysts said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tariffs&#8217; impact on US consumers will be tangible, so the US also does not want the tariffs, but it also wants to use them as leverage in the trade talks,&#8221; Song Guoyou, director of the Fudan University&#8217;s center for economic diplomacy in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent mixed signals out of Washington also underscored the dilemma faced by Trump. US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Monday that Trump did not want to implement the new tariffs but there has to be &#8220;movement&#8221; from China, according to Reuters. But The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Trump could go either way, citing people with knowledge of the deliberations.</p>
<p><strong>US miscalculation&nbsp;<br /></strong><br />
<br />&#8220;The US thinks that China is being hurt more in the trade war and is eager for a trade agreement. And based on this miscalculation, it wants to gain more in the trade negotiations, but China also has a bottom line,&#8221; said Sang Baichuan, director of the Institute of International Business at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, noting that China will not back down from its demand of removing existing tariffs for a trade agreement.</p>
<p>Apart from rolling back tariffs, Chinese officials have also insisted that any potential deal must be mutually beneficial and acceptable and the US&#8217; request for agricultural purchases must be reasonable and based on market rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the US keeps using the signing or not signing of a trade deal to demand things that go beyond China&#8217;s bottom line, it will not work,&#8221; Song said, adding that the new tariffs will have a much bigger impact on the US than China because US consumers will face higher prices. &#8220;For China, the bearish sentiment [toward the tariffs] has already evaporated… the country is well prepared to cope with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The implementation of the tariffs will also likely prompt stock selloffs around the world, as it would further cast a dark cloud over the global economy, which is already under mounting downward pressure, Song said. &#8220;The best scenario is that a deal could be reached,&#8221; he said.<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />Chinese expertise on public transportation will help Pakistan to better address its growing demand for public transportation, as the country tested its first-ever mass rapid transit train in Lahore, its economic hub, a Chinese expert said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan on Tuesday put the Orange Line Metro Train through its first test run after the completion of the physical infrastructure stage of the project.</p>
<p>The move is a major step forward under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).</p>
<p>Zhou Rong, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, said the addition of a first-rate, modern public transit service will be a major boon to the Pakistan economy and people as the country is set to surpass Brazil to become the world&#8217;s fifth most populous country in the near future.</p>
<p>Pakistan is expected to have a population of 400 million by 2050, according to Zhou.</p>
<p>In Punjab, there are over 100 million people and Lahore has over 10 million residents, so public transportation has become a rising issue.</p>
<p>Addressing increasingly serious traffic congestion at an affordable cost will be a key, Zhou said.</p>
<p>The test run was made across Lahore via a 25 kilometer route. There are 26 stations including 24 elevated stops and two underground stations. It is expected to cut travel time by more than 70 percent, Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>The Xinhua News Agency described the project as a token of China-Pakistan friendship and a project that provides a high-class transportation service of international standards.</p>
<p>Zhou said the system will bring benefits to commuters and office workers in the city while the roomier train compartment provides ready access to an area exclusively for women.</p>
<p>Zhou predicted the tickets for such a service will be priced at an affordable level to allow the maximum number of citizens to use it.</p>
<p>Now into its sixth year, the focus of CPEC has shifted from addressing Pakistan&#8217;s energy shortage woes to public transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rolling out of an electrified subway system showed that Pakistan&#8217;s energy issues are being effectively addressed,&#8221; Zhou told the Global Times.</p>
<p>The system will have a total of 27 sets of energy-saving electric trains, with air-conditioned cabins and an operating speed of 80 km per hour.</p>
<p>It is expected to transport 250,000 passengers daily when it is fully operational in the first half of 2020, according to Xinhua. With another two rail lines, the Lahore Metro system is expected to transport half a million people daily by 2025.</p>
<p>The project funded by the Export-Import Bank of China is part of the CPEC and is built by a joint venture of China Railway Corporation and China North Industries Corporation.</p>

<p>Macao aims to play a more active role in the integration of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and explore markets along the routes of the China-proposed<br />
<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn//special-coverage/2nd-BRF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belt and Road</a> Initiative (BRI) to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on the gambling industry. Close ties with the Chinese mainland will be the only way for Macao to counter external pressure, local business representatives and officials told the Global Times in interviews.</p>
<p>Located in southern China, the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) has been developing under the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; principle while enjoying a high degree of economic freedom. However, its economy is vulnerable to headwinds created by US&#8217; tariff war and its own heavy dependence on the casino industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Particularly when gambling revenues have continued falling due to sluggish economic growth and lingering external uncertainties, local businesses said they feel the urgency of diversifying the economy away from the gambling sector.</p>
<p>Although Macao is an international city, its level of internationalization is much lower than that of Hong Kong. Macao&#8217;s promising future is guaranteed by deepening ties with the mainland, Lao Ngai Leong, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;My confidence for implementing the &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217; principle has never been shaken, and Macao has seen rapid growth in recent decades thanks to the support of the central government,&#8221; Lao said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s economy expanded to 444.7 billion Macao patacas ($55.2 billion) in 2018 from 51.9 billion in 1999 when the city returned to the motherland and the average wage has reached 20,000 Macao patacas per month, official data showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, due to its limited market size and resources, Macao has to further integrate into the Greater Bay Area to diversify its industries, as the dominant position of casinos accounts for about 80 percent of its GDP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IMF has estimated that the city&#8217;s economy will contract by 1.3 percent in 2019 and 1.1 percent in 2020, before returning to growth in 2024, according to media reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macao is still facing obstacles in economic diversification, which will remain a major task for local authorities. But the city could use its advantages in terms of high autonomy and free markets, which would offer it a way out of recession, Edmund Ho Hau-wah, the first chief executive of the Macao SAR government, said during a recent group interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global casino hub has already made progress in reducing reliance on the gambling sector. As of the end of 2017, the total value added of emerging industries including exhibitions, financial services, traditional Chinese medicine and cultural start-ups had increased 23.6 percent from 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the average wage of individuals in Macao is higher than in Southeast Asian countries, so developing labor-intensive industries would be less competitive, according to local officials. The Macao SAR government has invested heavily in developing traditional Chinese medicine, and it will increase its exports of these products to Portuguese-speaking countries and Southeast Asian countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to enhanced cooperation with the Greater Bay Area, local businesses in Macao expect to play a larger role in connecting China with Portuguese-speaking countries, as part of an effort to take part in the BRI.</p>
<p>&#8220;For historical reasons, Macao had close ties with Portuguese-speaking countries and it could continue playing a role as a bridge as well as a platform in that aspect,&#8221; Teresa Mok, coordinator of the support office of the Permanent Secretariat of Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and Portuguese Speaking Countries (Macao), told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every year, we helped coordinate representatives from those countries to seek investment opportunities in the mainland through Macao, and also helped mainland companies go abroad though Macao. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll strengthen this role in helping companies tap into larger markets,&#8221; she said.<br />

<p>Macao has no intention of competing with Hong Kong, said government officials, as Macao reveals its ambitions to develop offshore yuan business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such ambitions, in a city whose economy has been dominated by gambling for years, has triggered heated discussion and led to divided opinion among economists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some are optimistic that the former Portuguese colony will evolve into China&#8217;s offshore yuan center, and some question whether Macao has the intention to challenge Hong Kong&#8217;s role as a financial hub, when the latter is experiencing social instability that is also spilling over into the financial sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We (Macao and Hong Kong) are not rivals, we&#8217;ll do things that others won&#8217;t do,&#8221; said Ip Sio Kai, deputy general manager of the Bank of China&#8217;s Macao Branch.</p>
<p>Chan Sau San, chairman of board of the directors at the Monetary Authority of Macao, told the Global Times in a recent interview that Macao has no intention of competing with Hong Kong, as it has a much smaller pool of offshore yuan.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, Macao has seen rapid economic development. Compared with the time when it returned to the motherland in the late 1990s, the city now enjoys stable social order, booming investment and trade, and has more ambition to enhance its competitiveness in the financial sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macao recently submitted a proposal to the central government for the establishment of a securities exchange that is to become &#8220;the offshore yuan-denominated Nasdaq&#8221;, said He Xiaojun, director of the Guangdong Local Financial Supervision and Administration Bureau, in October.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city is carrying out feasibility studies on the establishment of such a market, as designated by the Chinese government in February when China revealed its outline development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a program to create an economic hub incorporating Hong Kong, Macao and South China&#8217;s Guangdong Province.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, the central government issued 2 billion yuan ($284.2 million) in bonds in Macao, the first official issuance by the central government in the former Portuguese colony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Macao will further focus on yuan-denominated transactions to help boost the internationalization of the yuan,&#8221; Ip told the Global Times.</p>

<p><strong><br />Different focus</strong></p>
<p>The cities of Hong Kong and Macao will each have a different focus when it comes to developing their financial sector, making them allies rather than enemies, officials and experts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, said that Macao will focus on offshore yuan settlements while Hong Kong will have advantages in stock listings and insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Macao is on the way to becoming a one-stop investment and trading platform for offshore yuan, with businesses ranging from securities and bonds to bank lending,&#8221; said Dong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macao will become the ultimate offshore yuan center, one that is distinguished from the current offshore yuan hubs in Hong Kong or London that only deal with simple deposit businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such an arrangement would also enhance the offshore yuan&#8217;s investment functions and encourage its global usage, he said.</p>
<p>Another thing that will set Macao&#8217;s financial sector apart from Hong Kong&#8217;s is that Macao will tilt toward business with Portuguese-speaking countries, given the historic connection it has with those economies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Macao and Hong Kong financial markets could be complementary, as Macao aims to facilitate financial services and transactions with Portuguese-speaking countries,&#8221; said Chan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For historical reasons, Macao has sustained regular contact with Portuguese-speaking countries, the EU and Latin American countries in fields including economic matters, culture, law and trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merchandise trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries reached $96.985 billion in the period from January to August 2019, up 2.31 percent year-on-year, according to official data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lin Jiang, an economics professor at Lingnan College, said that Macao can develop financial businesses in western Guangdong on behalf of Hong Kong, considering its proximity to the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For or against Macao?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But opinion is still divided as to whether Macao can become as the offshore yuan center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dong is one of those betting on the city. He said one advantage that Macao has is that it allows free capital flows, unlike the mainland, and yet is very much integrated with the mainland economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese government has been rolling out measures to develop Hengqin Island, a kind of gateway located west of Macao and south of Zhuhai. Parts of the island have been leased to Macao to support development of the Greater Bay Area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume most of Macao&#8217;s offshore yuan business will be operated on Hengqin Island in the future, where advantages from both sides &#8211; talent from the mainland and Macao&#8217;s high-standard services &#8211; can each play a part,&#8221; Dong said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But some also expressed worries as to whether Macao has enough financial resources to support its ambitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there enough investors or international financial institutions in Macao? Does it have a sound legal environment to attract financial activities? Will transactions be active if such a securities market opens?&#8221; Lin told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Macao&#8217;s securities exchange, if it materializes, will need to find its own place amid a cluster of financial institutions &#8211; not only from Hong Kong but also in surrounding mainland areas, such as the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and a futures exchange that is expected to be established in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Companies from the island of Taiwan are being encouraged to participate in projects involving major technological equipment, industrial innovation centers and other activities under equal treatment in the Chinese mainland, which could facilitate their technological innovation and quality development, an official said.</p>
<p>This process has important meaning for Taiwan&#8217;s economic growth, which has been slowing for years, and the development of its technology sector, Dai Shugeng, director of the International Finance Research Office at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In terms of industry development, the mainland has surpassed Taiwan in many technological fields, Dai said, and the measures could offer great opportunities and cooperation for Taiwan companies under the condition of equal treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese mainland welcomes Taiwan-funded companies to make full use of the vast market and development opportunities in the mainland to enhance technological innovation capabilities and market competitiveness,&#8221; Zheng Chiping, deputy director of the Department of Foreign Capital and Overseas Investment of China&#8217;s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said at a press conference on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mainland has a full range of industries, ranking first in manufacturing scale in the world, and it has rapidly improved its industrial technology, Zheng told the media.</p>
<p>Among the &#8220;26 measures&#8221; rolled out by the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office and the NDRC in November, the first measure noted that Taiwan-funded companies could equally take part in projects involving major technological equipment, construction of industrial innovation centers, engineering research centers and other activities.</p>
<p>Taiwan companies could enjoy equal treatment with companies from the mainland, Zhang said, adding that some Taiwan-based&nbsp; companies are actively participating in these projects and enjoying preferential policies such as full refunds of value-added tax.</p>

<p>US software development platform GitHub plans to set up a subsidiary in China to continue serving Chinese developers amid tightening US export controls. Analysts said China is a market US technology companies can&#8217;t lose and the move is a response to the uncertainty caused by the China-US trade war.</p>
<p>Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst, said that Washington&#8217;s policies on trade with China have gone back and forth, which businesses cannot afford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faced with the uncertainty caused by the trade war between China and the US, companies from all over the world, especially US companies, are responding to the tension with long-term preparations to avoid potential risks,&#8221; Ma told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>GitHub plans to establish a wholly owned subsidiary in China as the first step, in a &#8220;phased approach,&#8221; and later it will explore joint ventures and the possibility of hosting GitHub content in China, said Erica Brescia, chief operating officer of the world&#8217;s biggest software development platform GitHub, during an interview with the Financial Times on Monday.</p>
<p>Brescia said that China was &#8220;very encouraging&#8221; of the phased plan and the company would lobby US regulators to prevent the expansion of export controls.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important purpose of GitHub setting up a subsidiary in China is that the company cannot lose the Chinese market and its profits, and maintain sustainable development amid the contradictory trends of globalization and trade protectionism,&#8221; Ma noted.</p>
<p>China has become the second most important market for GitHub in terms of the number of developers after the US, and the market is growing rapidly, according to GitHub&#8217;s Octoverse report for 2019. The rate of forking and cloning open source use on GitHub by Chinese developers increased 48 percent in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is a very competitive market for companies, because technology products are quickly updated. If the leading companies in the industry don&#8217;t compete in the Chinese market and share information and ideas about the competition, there are risks for the long-term development of those companies,&#8221; Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p>
<p>China is home to an increasing number of software contributors as 31 percent of Asia&#8217;s total 4 million contributors called China home in 2019, according to the report.</p>
<p>Chinese technology giants including Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent are developing open source code, which are future competitors of GitHub in the second-largest market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in October 2018 and remained an open platform. Industry insiders said the merger will make both more competitive in the open source field to better face market competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the US is launching a global trend of trade protectionism, China is opening its market further to foreign investors,&#8221; said Tian, adding that the Foreign Investment Law is giving confidence and security to foreign companies, and the law is the reason that GitHub will set up a wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China.</p>
